MBS. HUBBARD'S ' THREE: WARNING'S'.: It tf-as ip.,the, days of our grandmothers, when there" were brick ovens in the land, that Mr. Hubbard-bought his- house, and bought it very much against' -his • wife's will. It was a lonely house,, and reported to be haunted. It was/next tp.a-grave ■yafc£ which though'uhused was not cheer7 • ful, land which had likewise the reputa tion of a ghost. However, Mri Hubbard' did not believe in ghosts, and was too cheerful to be depressed by warnings, and "never intended to be lonely. 5 " Mrs.? Hubbard," he said, when .his wife shook her head over; the purchase, "I/got. it cheap, and it is a good one. "Xouiwill like it' when .yoti/.get. there. If /you don't, why then talk." ' , ... „ t i! So the house was boughtand, into it the .Hubbard family went. There :was .scarcely a chance for a ghost to show his face aniid such." a family of boys and girls. Mr. and Mrs. Hubbard counted ten of them, all noisy ones. . ' ; Having once expostulated and spoken -out her mind as to the; house, Mrs.' Hubbard gave up the'point/ She scrubbed, and scoured, tacked down carpets,rand put up curtains,; and owned, that"; the place was pretty. ■ -As,-not a ghost ap peared for a week, sheuiade'up'her .mind that there were no such inhabitants ; 'she even began not- to mind the tombstones.' So the house got to rights at last, and baking day came about. In the press of business, they had a great dehl. of'baker's bread, and were now tired of .it;;.",,} Mrs. Hubbard thever enjoyed ' setting a, batch of bread to rise as she did that which was to be eaten for the first time in the new house. ' : - " For I cannot get up an appetite for ,stuff, that nobody knows who has had .the making of," said Mrs. Hubbard, "and :all puffy and alumy besides." " "So into the oven went the bread, and out it came at the proper time, even and brown and beautiful as loaves could be. Mrs!: Hubbard turned them-up on their sides as she drew them forth, and they stood in the long bread-tray,, glorious proofs of her skill and the excellence of the. oven, when Tommy Hubbard bounded in. ; Tommy was four; and when at that 'age we are prone to believe that anything will bear our'weight. ' Tommy, therefore;' anxious to inspect the newly-made bread, swung himself , off his feet by clutching the edge of the. br'ead-tray, and. over it came, loaves and Tommy and all.. Mrs. Hubbard flew to the , rescue, and picked up the loaves. All were dusted and put in the tray again but one. That lay bottom upwards under the-table.-1/ " A bothering child, to give • ?me -so much trouble !" she said^ as -she crawled under the table to. get it. " A—0—ah— dear, dear,- dear—oh—O my——" • - ■ And there on the" floor, sat, MrsV'-Hub-' 'bard, screaming,"wringing her hands, and 'shaking her head. The children screamed in- concert. Mr. Hubbard rushed in from the garden where he was at work. : , '^'What's the matter, mother?" 'he gasped. . „•'« J:/\ i Mrs. Hubbard pointed to the bottom of the loaf lying!in'her,lap. ' ; . vAA'' \- ."Look,there and:see !"rshe said;.; is a-warnings William; I am. going-to be. taken from them all:" ; ; - A And lie looked and he saw'a-'death's head and prpssVb'ones, As plainly, engraved as they possibly could he.. , - : ('r'flt is accident," said Mi. Hubbard. "Such queer cranks do ;'come, you know." ' ' ' rd ! .• But Mrs. Hubbard was in a troubled state of mind, as was but.natural. " The stories about the haunted house werei true," she' said;; "and the spirits have marked the loaf. - I am afraid it is a warning." ' "" " - ; A^nd the loaf was put aside, "for even Mi.' Hubbard, did.not dare:to eat any of it. ■ . Mrs. Hubbard got ; over, her fright at last, but the news of the awfully marked loaf spread, through it . ,—, and the. people came, to Hubbard's all. the week to look at'it. 'It -was a death's-head and cross-bones certainly; every one saw that at a glance, but as to its meaning, people differed. SQme believed that it was a warning of approaching death; some " thought that the spirits wanted to frighten ' the:;' Hubbards. away, and get-' pp^session 'of the' house again, all to . themselves. This latter supposition: inspired Mrs. Hubbard 'with courage ; finally, being a brave woman, she adopted the belief, and when another baking day arrived, put her loaves into the oven once more, prepared for cross bones, and not to be frightened by them. The loaves baked as before: > They came out brown and crusty as Mrs. Hubbard turned each in her hands, There were no cross-bones visible, but. on, tlie last were sundry characters or letters. What, no one could tell, until there dropped in.for a chat a certain printer of the neighbor hood, accustomed to reading things back ward. ; . . . . .■ . . " By George," said.he, 5;!tHat!^;C,urip1us." That is -curious—r-e-sur-r- grUrlm^ i.'resur gamthat is what is on the loaf—re? jSutgaih." '• :' ' 'A* " It is what they put on tombs, isn't it ?" asked poor Mrs. Hubbard, faintly. " Well, yes," said Mr. Hubbard, being obliged to admit.it."-But-it is not so bad as cross-bones and skulls!" Mrs. Hubbard shook her head. "It's even solemner," said the 'little woman, who was not as good a linguist as .'thread maker. "I feel confident, William, that I shall soon be resurgamed, and what will these dear children do then?'' ' ;Andj now that the second loaf was before i her eyes, marked even more awfully than the first, Mrs. Hubbard grew rieally pale and thin, and lost her cheerfulness. ; "T have a presentiment," she said, over and over again, "that the third baking; will decide who the warning be longs to. I believe it is .meant for me, anil time will show. Don't you see how thin i! am growing ?" . Aiiclj though Mr. Hubbard laughed, he also.'; b.egan to be troubled. The third baking day was one of gloom. Solemnly, as at a funeral, the family assembled to' assist in the drawing. '. Five loaves came out markless ; but one remained. -: Mrs. Hubbard's hand trembled, but she diew it forth; she laid it • on the tray ; ishe turned softly about. • At last she exposed the lower surface. On it were (letters printed backward, plain enough to read this time, and arranged thus :-|— ''' - "Died April'2n(b V. :~ . | lamented by > I 1 ': her large-family." • - " vj" '• "It is me," cried .Mrs. Hubbard! ;. > fl am to | go,tb-morrow!!. •' &his;'is .'.
