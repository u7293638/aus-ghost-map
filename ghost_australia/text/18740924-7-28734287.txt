He in spires the prayer, and can and does respond. Bat prayer matt be dbtinot and definite. The blind man for a long lime oriad— * Have merer upon me, thoa Son of David;* and oar. ford's answer to that' prayer was, .'WJiut wilt thou that I should So onto tbee?' When the man shaped the burden of Us need into a.definite request—'Lord, that I night receive my sight —the Mnaaug was at onoe given. Through the centuries the voloa of prajer ha« not oaasnd, neither has the Lord* ear been heavy that it has not bawd; bat too often the prayer has been indefinite. To-day the Lord asks His people, * What will ye that I should do unto rea ?' We need now to define oar needs—'Lord that we might receive re. aawed life—life In oar own souls, In our duties at home and in the mart, in our Ohoroh work and every service.* It may be with as as with Israel in the olden time—God wait* to bestow the gifts; yet to do these things He will be en quired of by the house of Israel; not by one family or one individual, but by the whole boose. Were (he Church as a whole in sympathy with God—for without this, prayer will not awdl— did we really desire revival, with power to win souls, and did we plead this distinct prayer, revival would oome.
