THE TOWER BEAR. The Tower of London, which ought to be haunt ed, if any place is, once boasted an awe-inspiring Bpectre that assumed the shape of a bear. Be fore the turning Â«f the armories there was a paved yard in front of the Jewel House, from ?which a gloomy and ghostlike doorway led down a flight of stairs .to the Mint. Strange noise's used to be heard in this gloomy corner: and on a dark night, in January, 1816, the sentry saw a figure like' a bear cross the pavement, and dis appear down the . steps. This so terrified-, htm that he fell, and in a few hours, after having re covered sufficiently to tell the tale, he died. This unfortunate affair, which was fully inves tigated by an official inquiry, is believed to have arisen from phantasmagoria, and the governor doubled the sentry, and used such energetic pre cautions that no more ghosts haunted the Tower from that time. The soldier bore a high charac ter for bravery and good conduct, and the affair (created a considerable stir at the period.
