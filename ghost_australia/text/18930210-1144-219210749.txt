Correspondenca. To the Editor. Sir. — A letter appeared in a contemporary on the 26th inst., touching upon the coming eh e. tions and signed by "The Ghost of Hamlet." The said ghost is located- at Crystal Brook, and ju Igiug by the incoliereut sentences .and silly conjectures prefixel to his signature he is cer- tainly about ou a par with all' others of the spirit world who communicate to us poor mortals by rapping on tables and otherwise making fools of thethselves. This ghost is evidently a prophet, and he pradicts rs oniy one who floats in space, and whose eye looks down the vista of the future, and sees either Catt or Howe relegated to that iimhn, t >o resting place of all defeated politicians Hamlet is long since dead, and up to date it ia not recorded that his spirit has trou bled anyone, and why he should so far waudnr out of the fields of light (or fi e) into the dustv hole called Crystal Brook, unless it i-> to cool his heated frame, is beyond the comprehension of all sensible people. It is anticipated that the electors will study something more tangible than he of Crystal Brook, and if the old mem bers have served them faithfully, and conserved their interests, not the ghosts of fifty Hamlets will make tliern deviate from a righteous path, aud|bestow honor upon those to whom it is due. In conclusion, let the ghost be warned that elections are a bad time to he fooling around, he might be materialized and otherwise hurt. Htead is on the look nut for occult phenomena, and would no dnuht pay a premium to the Dovil and thus redeem the ghost from the slime and shade into which he has fallen. — I am. A REAL LIVE ELECTOR.
