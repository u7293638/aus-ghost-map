He who has no place for this ls*»aja> *■ his religion, who tonka he can be aaa»tNty without it, cannot have catered into the thought of God when He said, " Let us aake man!" He does not believe a the holy creation of (iod'a men and women. He may lie a aaint, bnt lie cannot be a man after God a own heart. The complete man alone is the saved aan. The saint ia but on the way thither, and haa to be saved from more than sin. " When shall we be married ?" said Donai. "Boon, soon," anawcred Arctura; "I am going very f*st !" " To-morrow then **" "There in no such haste as that—now that we uadentaed each other," ahe added, with a rosy auiilc. " I «-ant to be married to you before 1 die, that i» all—not just to-day or to morrow." " When you please, my love," said DonaL Hbe hud her bead on his bosom. "We nerd not make haste," she said. "We are aa good as married now. We both know that each loves the other. How shall I wait for you in heaven': You will be mine, yon know—a little lrit mine—wont you?—even if you should man-} some beautiful lady when I aa gone—l shall love her when she comes." ** Arctura," said Donai, " you do not know me y*t!" and she never ventured another word of that load to him. CHAITtk LJV. BtT this opening of the window of heaven, the unspeakable rush of life through channel* too narrow and banks too weak to hold ita tiJr, caused a terrible inundation: the red flood again broke it» banks and weakened all the Und. The next day she called Mr. tiraetuc, and sent ium to fetch the family lawyer from Edinburgh. Alone with him she C*\c instmctious concti-nini; her wilL I tanr}' from what dropped from the man of )iu»uie« afterwards thai »hv haj to behave to him with what he counted im|>eri<>u*ness.

" You hare a cousin who inherits the title," he »ucrvsted. , ..« "Mr. Fortune," she returned, las not unacquainted with nr own family. Perhaps I know a little more of it than you do. I have not much time to spare, and I did not tend for you to consult you, but to aak you to draw up my will according to my wishes. "1 beg your pardon, my lady," rejoined the lawyer, "but there are things which may make it the doty of one in whom the eon fidenoe of a family ia pmoed to apoak onL n "Speak, then; my whatever you fed it your duty to say; I wUI listen—for foar sake —that you may eaee your mind." Mr. Fortune straightway began a loaf, common-sense, worldly talk on the matter, nor once repeated himself. When he ceased, "Now. have yon eased your mindT she ■start have, my lady." "Than listen to my {attractions. If it goes s^simt your conscience to do m I wish, say so, and I will scad for another; there is no necessity that you should hurt either your feeling* or your prejudices." Mr. Fortune said not a word more, but took Us Instructions, rose, and was about to go. MWhenwio you bring me the will to sign T she asked. M In the course of a week or two, my mdy." "If it to not m my hands by tbe day after to-morrow, I will send for a gsnHiiman from the town to draw it up." " You shall have it. my lady," said Mr. For tune. And she did have it, and the will was signed and wHuiaasd.no one knowing a word •Tthe contents except themselves two. After this she sank more rapidly, and grew very weak. Donal said no word about the marriage : she would do just as she pleased ! He was now nearly all day by her bedside, rending to her when she was now to listen, talking to her, or nttingsileat when she was not. Mrs. Brookes now gave herself entirely to the turning of her launhip. and Arctura had at once tou her the relation in which she and Donal stood to each other. It cost the good woman many tear*, for she thought such a love one of the saddest thing* in a sad world.—Yon think so too? Ido not. Tbe earl about this time was n little better, though there was no pnwpect of even a tem porary recovery. Bat although he required km nursing Donal did not neglect him for the more absorbing duty of waiting on Arctura. He had grown much gentler, and some thing of sadness bad partially displaced the sullennem of his bearing. He seemed to have become in a mcasurr aware of the bmtenem of the life he lad hitherto led, and have had a glimnwof something better. It U wonderful what the sickness which stupid men and women regard a* the one evil thing can do towards their redemption from an eternal slaajsag True, they do aot consciously desire anyj^B redemption—far from it!—but there isanMH who does; and, as their very existence is tVM Be gives them no choice in the matter. M a¥fl shoswii concern at his niece's illness, amf_M she was now again in the sunny room ofYMJ lower floor, had himself carried down •vsrjnM to see her fora few minutes, and learn bonfJWi was going on. She received him always *MjH Ike greatest gentleness, and I believe fiß Gone affection for her had begun to waanjsH i by the time she became too ill to rej|M bis visits. Her last words to him be wftMH «ften repeat to himself: O "If there is anything I can do for 10m when we most again, dear ancle, be sure laJpH "TejTmy wife," bad come to bis Ups, botjfl further. He puslpuusd the message, aad s|H att see her again in this world. fl It was a BMmiag in the month of May— S The naked twigs were shivering all for cold' ™ whan Dnaal, who was lying on the conch in the neighbouring room, heard Mm. Brookes sail him: "My mdy wants too, sir." she said. He started up and went to asr. "Send forth* miniMer.-'she whispered-" not Mr. Gamuchael; be doss not know you! Send for Mr. Gnome too: he and Mrs. Brookes will be witnesses. I must call yon Awsaatf once before I die!" "I hope yon' will many a time after 1" he rstaratd. Shesaukdon aim with a look of love un utterable. "Mind." she said, botdiur out bar arms feebly, but drawing him tober bosom, "that this h how I love you ! When yon see me dull and stupid, and I hardly look at yon—for you know dying makes one stupid while it is going on -then say to yourself,' This is not bow she loves me; it is only how she is dying! She loves me and knows it, and by and by will be able to make me to know it.'" They were precious words for him to brood over afterwards. With seme careful questioning on the part of the minister, to satisfy hiaaeeff that she, so plainly at the gate of death, knew what she said, and desired to be called wife before she west, and not without sosae disapproving shakes of tbe head to sicnify that nothing so earthly ought to occupy too thoughts of his subjects in the presence of King Death, he did as he was requested, and wrote a certificate of the fact* which was duly signed aad witnessed by the three. "But he took it out in his prayer!" said Mistress Brookes with indignation. The bridegroom gave his bride one gentle kiss, and withdrew with the clergyman to the next roost. "This is a strange proceedingP said the minister. "Not no strange perhaps as it looks, sir!" said Donal. " On the brink of the other world!» "The other world and its brink too are His who ordained marriage!" " For this world only." ■\V?* *"*■ of **oa •re without repentance," said Donal. " 1 have heard of you," returned the clergy man, " as one of those who do not hesitate for their own ends to misuse Smutarc!" He had a painful douWt that he had been drawn into come plot! "Sir :' said Donal sternly, "if you thought there wa* any impropriety in the ceremony you havr now performed. »by <itd you jnrforn) it T I be;: you will reserve the r.-raarUs you ought to hsvc made Inforo.

The man wan not a little natoniahed at the tone assumed by Donal; but he saw at uncv that the lea mid the better.

Donal bad next a brief interview with BfcJ Graeme. The factor did nut know for w^A he had been summoned, and mi in a conditaaß of tome bewilderment. He little •aaiwct^Er however, bow the thine bore on his own f utt^E> and readily gave Donal a pledge of silence Ijpg (be jut—nt concerning the ceremony, lie Wt& garded it as the mere whim of a dying fV which, for the sake of the family, had b*tte#K< ignored and forgotten. How it night affect flKj property ho could only conjecture. There «J^H the wiU for one thine! But, if the "urd^l was proved, the will, made before it, m asßßj avail! I will not pain my reader* by lingering ojtfr the quiet gentle a*d time that followed. D4Bl was to Arctura.a» she said, like father. brotslg husband, all in one. Through him she nsW the harvest of the world, in spite of falseta^Jj ing, murder, temptation, and death, and gff* passing front the battlefield of the harvest M% torious indeed ! On the facr of her bridejrijMK, lay calm—for within was a peace the wMK could not give or take away. He loved X with a lore that cast the love of the former Mr into the shadow of a sweet but undesfreaWg^ membrane*. A long life lay before him wMMsI, the delight of his eyes would have vanmlHfr but he woold have plenty of work to do-.jpr saeh was the very foundation of the love bet^J> him and Arctura that every time be knfjPj: himself that he wan doing toe work <Jo*WK given him to do he would feel he was tjrfHw fresh bond between him and her: she washis because they were the Father's, whose wfflwaa the life and love of the universe. " I thin k." said Donal. utting that same night by her bed, "when my mother dies, she will go at once to somewhere near you; for there ■ever wan more godlike woman than she; I will, if I may, send you a message l»y her. Bat H can only tell you what yon will know-that I love you and am waiting to come to you.** Oh, the stupidity of callincaneselfaChristian, and donating if we shall know our friends hereafter! ft nmkes me angry to hear such silly horror from such mouth. For those who do not believe it is more than natural, bat for those who profess to believe—it merely show* what a ragged scarecrow is what they call their faith ; it is not worth that of many an old Jew, or that of Home pagans. "I shall not be far from yon, dear. I think —sometime*," the said, speaking very low. and with difficulty. "If you dream anything not ■ice about me, think something i» lying to yon •boat me.
