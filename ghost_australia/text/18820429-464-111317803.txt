A CUEIOUS CASE IN CONNEMAEA. SINGULAR RESULT OF AN IRISH EVICTION. In the Connaught Telegraph of the 4th Feb., we find a very interesting letter from James Berry in which he describes some harrowing scenes during the past and present persecution of the Irish people, and also gives the following interesting account of the RESULT OF AN HUSH EVICTION. Now I will tell you and your readers something that you never heard before — how an eviction brought about the building of the most beautiful castle in Ireland. Sir, did you ever hear of John Mitchell Henry, M.P., J.P., D.L. ? I am not sure he has any more of the alphabet behind his name, but for fear I would omit giving him his full dues jljWill :-say, } &a.;,.i&o.;, &p.;,, &c;, &c.;, &c.r; An 'eviction ' w! the ^ jca^p|of 'iE^^n^^^stil^ wi th i i is,, i sticfe p,i'es,';.c. to ;$ers, ^'j^pmna'cjes,'^'^^' fries,; '.Qmmney,3;,^ up. , amid ?

Here I am as empty of means per haps, but not so light- in pocket as John Louden's son was when Miss Mullholland eloped with him. ^ere I am with intellect and a memory fresh as ? the intellect of any man in Europe. Here I am, and show me the man who can strike terror into me. I'd like to see him. Here I am, his Sir Philip Francis. Now, I swear by the bones of my father, who lies buried in Kilgeever, if I hear any more of these threats I will give the world an auto biography of this man even to the most minute detail, etc., etc., etc. I crossed swords with Lord John Browne in a law suit, and I thrashed him. I bested old Sligo, and asked him to do a certain thing which I shall not mention. Now I am not going to be frightened. I think, Mr. Editor, that the man who could look at Mr. Luther's ghost in the Witch's house in Clifden and who talked to him is pot easily frightened. Now I drop this subject for ever. In my next letter I will give the rise, decline, and fall, not of Eome, out of the Jumper Colony of Moyrus, Connemara; and to interest the readers or tne Helegraiili berorehand I wish to tell how, like Carthage, this colony was founded by an amazon — how after spending her fortune here she had to run from a vaga bond .ZEneas of a Connemara man.
