"THE, .LAY OF THE LOST SPIRIT. . ' ! , By H. C. Cobbance. Hell s shadowy portals locked me m their womb Soon. abmy corpse was carried to the tomb ; But, 'with a force that I cannot restrain, My.'soiil is drawn to thoso abodes again. Here on the wings uf night my eoul is borne, Thither I'm fain to waft me back at morn. Here, where I sinned, repented, sinned again. Here inust' I rest, nor caii I ever roam ' Bbyohci the limits of my ancient homo. Men'shuh the place, they fear my form to see ; If they appear they, 'are but ghosts to me, For; days make weeks, weeks months, months years, but ever Ih. arenms I wander and in shadows quiver; 'Jmese/stones,- these trees, these buildings that are 7 here;.- ' ' ' !. .7 Dim, 'unsubstantial,. .and grotesque appear ; ' ' , Like midmghf yisionmisconceived at birth, ' ' Tliai flee the", morn that'reddens o'er the' earth/ 7 / ;j About the mouldering walls sad ivy 'clings';" About, them flutter foul, ill-omened things. " The gravelled drive has grown a grassy glade, - ... 0'erjwhich;taU fir-trees throw funereal 'shade! ' Thus-much without'; and when I' look within'- But one room can I see ; all else is thin And hazy as tho mist of early morn. Here 'mid my sins from life I erst was torn. Here all is real, well defined and clear, As 'gainst the blue the pencilled houghs appear. The woodwork rots ; in strips the paper falls, And hangs about the mildewed, mouldering walls ; Upon the floor the ceiling lies bestrewn : . All strikes the mind as notes struck out of tune. ' So when the night-wind howls about the walls, Or whistles thro' the dim and echoing halls, I, too, respond; with living fire I burn, And wail the things that never can return. Sorrows they have, but, oh 1 what mortal yet The deathless angnish of that vain regret ; For hope they have, but we have none to save Our thoughts from madness when beyofld the grave.
