THE MOTION OF CENSURE. Nobody, of course, believes that Mr. Lyne's motion of censure bas the smallest ghost of a chance of being carried. It is not even likely that those of the Freetraders in the Assembly who have lost confidence in Mr. Reid will vote for it. Mr. Morton, the Member for Shoalhaven, and Mr. Knox, the member for Woolahra, belong to this section. They do not like the Government a little bit, but when a political crisis happens Reid succeeds in muffling their claws. Both Morton and Knox are great swells, but as politicians they are inferior to the weakest member of the Labour party. Of course, the Labour party will give a solid vote against Mr. Lyne's motion. When the leader of the Opposition declared himself an enemy of the Convention Bill, he doubtless thought his action would have the effect of bringing the M'Gowenites to his side. I declared at the time it would not have that effect, that indeed the only result of his policy would be to alienate a considerable number of the Protectionists from him. Well, all that has come true. The Labour party used Mr. Lyne, and then laughed in his face. If be were to return from the next election with a majority at his back, the Labour party would grovel at his feet ; they always worship the top dog, whoever he may be. In replying to the motion of censure, Reid gave numerous indications that he was afraid of Barton ; the poor fe'low is now in the condition that many or the Civil Servants were in when the Public Service Commissioners were going through the departments with the view of effecting retrenchments. He feels that within the next three months he may be thrown out of his billet, and forced to worry round the district and police courts for a living. Undoubtedly, he has good cause to fear Barton.
