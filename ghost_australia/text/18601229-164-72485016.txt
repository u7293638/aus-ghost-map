MIDNIGHT MASS FOR THE DYING YEAR. YES, the year is growing old, And his eye is pale and bleared ; Death, with frosty hand and cold, Plucks the old man by the beard, Sorely, sorely. The leaves are falling, falling, Solemnly and slow ; . Caw ! Caw !' the rooks are calling, It is a sound of woe, A sound of woe. Through woods and mountain passes, The winds, like anthems roll, They are chaunting funeral masses, Singing, * pray for this poor soul Pray, pray.' And the hooded clouds like friars, Tell their beads in drops of rain, And patt( T their doleful prayers ; But their prayers are all in vain, All in vain ! Theer he stands in foul weather, The foolish, fond Old Year, Crowned with wild flowers, and heather Like weak, despised Lear ! A king !_a king ! Then comes the summer-like day Bids the old man rejoice ! fíis joy ; his lastl O, the old man gray, Loveth that ever- soft voice Gentle and low. » To the crimson woods he saith To the voice gentle and low, Of the soft air, like a daughter's breath, . Pray do not mock me so ; Do not laugh at me !*' And now the sweet day is dead, Cold in his arms it lies ; No stain from his breath is spread, Over the glassy skies, No mist or stain. Then too the Old Year dieth, And the forests utter a moan, Like the voice of him who criethr In the wilderness alone, Vex not his ghost. Then comes with an awful roar, Gathering and sounding on, The storm-wind from Labrador, The wind Eurocly don The storm-wind ! Howl ! howl ! and from the forest, Sweep the red leaves away, Would the sins that thou abhörest O, soul could thus decay And be swept away. Por there shall come a mighty blast, There shall be a darker day ; And the stars from the heaven downcast, Like red leaves be swept away. Kyrie, Eleyson, Christie, Eley son.
