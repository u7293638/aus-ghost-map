POETRY. Days and Thoughts. The thoughts of yesterday to-day Are dim, as though the evo and night Ha i darkened all the glowing way Of mind ; and, lo ! this morning's light Is shed for other thoughts that come And strike the yester-thinking dumb Thus, deedless days jmss into Time Like breath repassing into Spaoe : Of heights our thoughts at morn would climb, At night t here's not a step to trace ; And stars, like ghosts of days, approach To haimt us in our self- reproach. Some thoughts arc like a passing brood Of heary- bodied birds that wing Along the eroundway of our mood. Hut ne'er to skyward and freedom spring Till through oppression they return, A ud tea ha freedom they discern. And other thoughts like leafage fall, An i leave the tree of life bereft ; Then r.vnes the night to bo the pall For one sad leaf of thought that's left To fade hit ween the earth and moon. To fall, unknown, before the noon. Oh. days and thoughts ! I would I ran Apace with both ; no idle rest; Xo halting like a wearied man _ tv ith hairless lerronr in his breast ; Xo holding back while thoughts run on Till cut of thinking they have gone '. w 1lliax ttrbbcck.
