The Civil servants, & political pewer to b§ reckoned with, have taken, the gutter in band in sornefcluiig Jike g, systematic manner, and are pr-easing -? ttieir claims upon Ministerial atten^ tips in a way sot to .be ieeied.

The fond |a bankrupt, and Oks deficiency is every day growing grater. Mr. Beid realises the absolute necessity fw a. thorough -and ppeedy change to the whole sy«$em. There is now a suggestion to give to the scheme more of a life assurance «ha*acter ; but many persons will be disposed to fancy this a distinction without a difference. The mere alter ation . of the name of the thing, will not alter its character.; The truth is the trail of political influence has been over' it ? all from the first, and in various ways, not the least prominent being the premature pensioning off of Civil servants and the appointment of outsiders to take their places and become,eventually an extra drain upon the fund. To no class has ? the scheme been . so unfair as the female Civil servant, about ninety-nine out of every hundred having to contribute to the fund, with no prospect of ever benefitting hy it, and even with their contributions seeing the fund itself going from bad to worse. In view of the *' scan dal and disgrace,' as Mr. Beib con ii»ocD id vu oe, uxte xteeu. hoc oe - sur- ? prised that there should be growing up in the community a strong feeling against State pensions altogether, or superannuation in any form. The opinion is gaining ground that a person who happens to~ have been employed for the best part of his life by the State, should be no more an object of State solicitude than one employed by a private employer — that, in fact, both stand on an equal footing, with pre cisely equal rights and obligations of citizenship, and the one no more or no less a servant of the coun try, in the broadest sense of the term, than the other. When the question comes up for practical treatment by the Legislature it* is not improbable that this view will prevail with those in whose hands the ultimate settle ment of it rests. The answer of the Premier to Mr. Cameron's question as to why Mr. Clibboro, the seore. iftry to the Australian Jockey Club, hud tho privilege of a free paaa -?u the rail and tramways, puts the matter in a very intelligible way. The pass, Mr, Beidsaid, was granted in consideration of the large amount of business whioh the A.J.C. had brought to the tramway. This was surely a very bnsineasrjike reason. How ever. H didn'fc satisfy Mr. Cameron, who ejaculated ihafc it was 'f downright robbery.' The remark came with rather a bad grace from a gentleman whose 'use of a similar pririlege to that which he took exception to, as. in the cose of most of his fellow members, is, as many persons most deoidegly think, of the community at tfcrge. Let us look at the thing in a plainer way. If onr railways were run by a private company they would be yery apt, even cm the sforicteBfc business prin ciple?, to give a free pass to anybody in the position of My, Clibhprn. But jnoet certainly if such a concession were asked for members qf Parliament, it would, in Mr, Cameron's own phrase, be characterised as downright robbery.

A late telegram announces that there have been further shocks of earthquake e^ Laibaeh, the capital at Carniols, Slat 98 per cent, of the houses in that city have now been overthrown, and that the population, which is suffering terrible hardships,' is half demented with feat. This catastrophe At liftibach $e part of the great convulsion which lias within the last few days ravaged north eastern Italy and southern Austria. This is the graatest earthquake which has occurred in Italy einoe the horrible earthquake of February, 1887, which had its centre somewhat further west, ewept the Italian and French Biviera, and killed 2000 persons in Italian and twelve in French territory. That earthquake occurring as it did in the midst of the carnival festivities will long remain among the most vivid traditions of Southern Europe. Its incidents, too, afford some striking illustrations of the fact that of all perils earthquake is the one of which the terror is- not lessened by repeated experience, but rather the contrary. Many men who can stand a first shook with compara tive indifference become horrified by a second and absolutely panicstricken by a third. In 1887 there were some notable, instances and some notable exceptions. At Mentone there was — this is an instance of panic — one English, visitor at a fashionable hotel who held stoically refused to bolt into the garden when the other guests did bo. The strain, however, was too much for him, and, by the time the shocks ceased, he was a raving madman. As- for exceptions, the Prince of Wales who was at Cannes, and who had retired for the night after the last great Carnival ball of the season, behaved himself with possibly as much firmness as his ancestor at Detfcingen, . A terrified attendant knocked H.E.H. up, saying that there was an earth quake, to which H.E.H. replied that he was aware of the fact, bat did not see how he could help it, and so meant to stay where he was. That it waB carnival time gave the 1S37 earthquake some of its peculiarly ghastly features. Eyewitnesses describe the scene as resembling pictures of the Day of Judgment. The Biviera was crowded with visitors and when the walls of the houses in the various towns began to sway and the ground to heave, panic Btricken people from masquerades who had not had time to doff their fancy dress were seen rusting about, their strange costumea giving the scene an air as though selections from 'all the nations of the earth had been drawn together by some awful summon?. Among these were scattered men and women in ordinary apparel, and others who had fled in their night clothes, who without much imagination might have been taken for the dead risen again. The panic was intensified for the reason that all the railways affording exit from the Biviera ran tbrpujjh tunnels in the mountains, and there was not an unreasonable apprehension that these tunnels might fall, while the telegraphs were down in many places and so but little information could be had. The only place of safety seemed for the moment to be the sea ehore, and then there arose a fear , among those who had sought the sea shore that the Mediterranean might, as the Pacifla often has during South American earthquakes, recede, and then rush inland, and drown the fugitives whole rale. The 1887 shock affected Monte Carlo, and if it had done much damage it would have been held by all pious people to have pointed a moral against gambling. But the solid 'buildings for wftich the iugofcten gains of M. Blanc and the illgotten subsidies of the Prince of Monaco had paid held good. The great loss of life was in the little Italian mountain villages, as Piano Marino in &-me of which the pious inhabit&gts; wer§ ov§rwhelmed after they had assembled in their old churches to pray. The headquarters pf the SSamgipn. of Unrighteousness at Monte Carlo really suf fered less than any neighboring place. The great earthquake, like other tra gedies, was sdt witheat its comic side?. Certain persons returning from carnival festivities saw the houses swaying, asd .merely walked with extra eare, cpmforj; igg th§PMielT(2S wi$h. the reflection that if they poulg only g§i; to bed eoda water next morning would set them (the men, not the houses) all right.
