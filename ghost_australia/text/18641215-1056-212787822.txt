THE HAUNTED CHAMBER. In thy heart thcro is a chnmbcr — None but God and thou have seen it- Darkened by the sombre shadows From tho folds of thought that screen It. On tts walls are many pictures, w . Painted by tho hand of Time, Sketches of thoso mystic regions Iq tho InGnite sublime. There arc portraits of tho faces That have passed away from earth; Glimpses of those sunny places Sacred to thy childhood mirth ; Of the homestead, old and mossy, Closo beside tho meadow green, 'Whero the brooks, liko threads of silver, Wound their graceful curvo betweon. And it is a haunted chamber; # Tlioro the ghosts at iniduight stray, Siloot as the stars that wander Down the whitc-pav'd Milky Way. You behold tho light forms trembling . In their pure robos like a brido,. And they look so much like living, You forgot that they have died — You forget the marble features Of tho friend you laid at rest— 0 You forget tho pnlo hands folded On a pulseless, soulless breast. But vou see liira slowly walking 'Mid tho glow life's sunsot weaves, When his lips dropp'd farewell blessings. And the trees their autumn leaves. Thus comes ho long since departed, Reaching out his hand to thiuo, And his lips unto thee murmur In a tone that seems divine. In this chamber stands a mirror, Memory's lamp hangs overhead. Throwing down a softcn'd radiance On theso pictures of the dead. In its clear depths we distinguish 'What wo were, and what wo are, . ..There our inner life, rolloctod, Shows us hideous or fair. Oh I 'tis in this secret'chamber- That wo learn u solemn truth. As in links of spirit union % Ago is joined again with youth. — Australasian.
