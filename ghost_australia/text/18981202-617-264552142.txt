ONE ON "THE JUDGE." Roy Bean, tho high judge of the courts of Langtry, where juBtice is dished out to the living and dead alike in Judge Bean's own novel and distinctive way, was in San An- tonio lost week, on the occasion of which visit bo was mado the victim of a cruel practical joke, says the San Antonio " Express." He met a drummer at the hotel, who said he had just conio from Lanstry. "Did you see my bear ? How is he getting along ?" was the justice's first question. Judge Bean's bear throughout West Texas stands second in faino to tlie judgu himBelf. The animal was chained to a tree in the rear of tho judge's beer saloon, and in ita day drank many a bottlo of beer at a cost of 25c per bottle, to the edification of the wayfarer who was compelled to spend a few hours in Judge llcan's judicial district. ' Didn't you hear of it'/" asked the drummer. " The boar died last night." The dummer had an old score to wipe out at ltoy Bean's expense, and lie succeeded in convincing the judge that his bear was dead. Roy Bean lost no time in making for the telegraph ofbcc, where he penued these instructions: " Skin tlie bear, and express the skin to me at once." To this ho attached his signature, which is the law in Langtry. Bean sman at tho saloon promptly killed the boar and expressed the skin, and in the letter that accompanied the fur was this note: We hated to kill the bear, and lie hated to die. Ittook three shots before he gave up the ghost. Weare now Bmoking tlie basons. When Roy Bean roccivcd the message he broko three chairs und then set out in qurBt of the drummer. The offender iB said to be conducting earnest diplomatic negotiations by mail with " The Law of West Texas."
