NEW GUINEA. LIFE ASDMANNEBB OF THE PAETJAKS. A missionary, who has just returned to England from New Guinea (says the Globe), speaking of the inhabitants of the south-east portion of the island, states that tbe coBtnme ol a Papuan belle consists of earrings and tattooing. (The former ornaments are in sneh favour that sometimes as many as fifty will be seen hanging from a single ear, while the art of tattooing is carried to as high perfection as among the Burmese. To be very fashionable, a young lady of New Guinea must cover herself with a psrfeot network of indelible marks, and then, but not till then, she may look for an eligible parti with some prospect of success. The wooden houses of the oountry are said to be remarkably well built, while gardening is quite a passion with the Papuan men. They also hunt and fish, while the women employ themselves in housework, and act as beasts of burden when changing residence. So far, however, from considering this latter a hardship, it is a right of which tbe sex are extremely proud, and any foreigner who went among them agitating for restrictions on female labour would soon have a hornets' nest about his ears. There are, unhappily, two very unpleasant propensities among, the gentlemen of New Guinea. They delight in thieving, and they are proficients in murder. As a' North American " brave" prides himself on the scalps he possesses, so does a Papuan elegant receive perennial happinness from the tattoo marks on the sable skin. Each of these signifies a successful murder, and so strong is the taste for suoh embellishment that expeditions are often organised by the young men against unprotected villages, for no other reason than to obtain the right to have their faoes and chests tattooed with the brand of assassination. The religion of the country amounts to nothing more than a belief in ghosts and evil spirits, to whom they ascribe all the ills of life.
