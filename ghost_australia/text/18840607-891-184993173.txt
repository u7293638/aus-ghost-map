'* Town Talk. In a case tried in court the other day one of the " parties " was a Gorman. His counsel asked him, " When you ascertained - so and so ! what steps did you take ?" " What shteps did I take ?" returned the literal German; " why Iahtep'ped.orer the road to Mr. Smith, the lawyer, and 1 told him to wire into the other fellow.," ____________________________ There are many methods of how not to do it. The street sweeping system of tho Muni cipal Council is one of them., It is all Tery well to sweep the middle of t]ie road, but the effect is not good when the sweepings are all carefully worked to the side of the road, and left tharetoformauimpassablebarriertopedestrians. Wayfarers would much prefer, to have an average inch of mud, a la pea soup, all over the road than a dry oasis in the middle, and a fire- ( iuchalough of despond at eaoh side. ______________________________________ According to the new arrangements entered into by the Post Office authorities, we shall in future have about seven mails a month eaoh way \- between London and Brisbane. This, at first sight, appears to'bo a grand thing. It is' suggestive of course of moro frequent correspondence between relatives and friends in the old and new worlds. But it won't have this effect. ' Not a bit of it. Quite the oontrary. In faot cor respondence of this'sort has been falling off over since the good old times when there was only a mail a'month. Under the new system thore will be so many opportunities of sending letters tbat dilatory writers—and who will not put off writing a letter as long as he can?—will pro crastinate until they are ashamed to write ab all, when they realize tho number of mails they have missed. No, paradoxical as it may sound, letter-writing, will fall off . materially when we can write seven times a month. ______________________________ There is nothing like an intelligent supervision of affairs entrusted to one. The chairman of the Ithaca Board is quite alive to the ratepayers interests —enthusiastically so. At the board meeting the valuator brought up a report showing that his valuation in a couple of instances had been set aside by the Appeal Court, Some strong language was used at the board meeting over those decisions, and the chairman declared that if he had had the least idea of such un Daniel like judgments being given he would have had the best legal advice obtainable at the court, even if it took the whole of the rates to do it. This is good wholesome indignation. But there are always a lot of individuals in all communities who are utterly without soul, and these would probably object to the carrying out of this noble idea. This kind of people always want to argue every matter. They would, no doubt, say that supposing you had spent the whole of the rate money in feeing lawyers, how can you say that the Appeal Court would have given any other decision than the one it did ? These miserable calculators don't understand line sentiment. ___________________________________ A Telegram informs U3 that in Victoria they are proposing to form a bicycle corps in connection with tho defence foror. We rather approve of this idea, and can eoe many ways in which the bicycle can'he advantageously used in warfare. There iB a stealthy, cat like style about bicycle riders, that eminently fits them for skirmishing. The tread of soldiers, how ever soft it may be made, is at once heard by the enemy on near approach. Brisbane pedes trians ,can vouch for it that there is no hearing a bicyclo until it is upon them What a panic a squadron of bicycles coming up ghost-like in the darkness would create in the ranks of an enemy. But how about tho military text-book. What a lot of alterations there would have to be in the words of command if bicycling became an arm of the service. It would be no use to tell a bicyclist, to " stand at easel" He couldn't do it. He would have to "fall out," or rather, "fall over." "Bight and left wheel" would - have to be changed to " front and hind wheel." In fact, the corps would requiro a text-book of its own. But that is no reason why the new idea should not be carried out. It it . infinitely better than cavalry. * ' ■ A boss by any other name would smell as sweet—which may be plagiarised int) "Small pox by any .other name will kill as surely." Tho doctors in Melbourne have been quarrel ling over a patient named Barker. One set of medicos declare solemnlv that ho was suffering from smallpox. Another set swear by their great godB that virulent chickenpox was what' was tho matter with him. When doctors dis agree, Ac. One thing they aro now all agreed upon is, that whatever diseise tho man had, it hoe killed him. And now, as a sort of dttu ex mn china, to set matters right, comes Dr. Youil, who declares that the trouble was neither smallpox nor chickenpox, but a brand new disease developed in Australia; so nearly resembling smallpox that it is almost impossible to "tell t'other from which." Will' Victoria want to protect this new disease, seeing that it is a native produc tion. At any rate, as wo have now a smallpox of our own, it is to be hoped the doctors will find a fine now name for if. The present designation is an abominable one. We have had a long eiperienceof volunteer ing. v It dates, in fact, from the time when we formed up in Hyde Park for the first great review by Her Majesty the Qnoen, when the Duke of Wellington is reported to have said only he didn't—that he did not believe there was a" general who could get those 20.000 men out of the park again without breaking them up. Well, our experience is'that volunteering is great fun—at first; it is like a new toy to a haby. Then it palls. When we first join we are all enthusiasm. We shake our fist in the face of an imaginary enemy, and cry, " Come on." We spend all our spare cash and more on our uniform and fixings, and swear by the sabre of our sire that we will sacrifice everything to our country—oven our dinner. Then, when the novelty has diminished, we begin to taper off, until we get into tho state that Colonel French, the commandant of the defence force, has remarked on in his terse and humorous report. All the corps in the colony muster so many on paper, but when it is a question of inspections, then rather less than half the men turn up. This ■ is the case with |-the Queensland corps. One exception to whioh tbe colonel draws' attention is the Gympie corps, which At a recent inspection turned out 59 officers and men out of a total of 60. But this remarkable state of things is easily ex plained. That Gympie corps is newly-formed, 'lis the new toy, in fact. We don't want to be prophets of evil, but we venture to declare that as soon as this new broom ceases to be new, it will be tho old story over again. Tbebe is a new cure-all advertised.' Wo wont find it out from.amongst the numberless advertised means of prolonging life to eternity. This particular prophylnctio is a German invention, and numberless testimonials proclaim its proficiency. We beliovo in the invention, but we should like to have it witnessed to in better Knglish. The conceited foreigner, it is very noticeable, always considers that he can write English with the aid of a dictionary, and he never submits his translation to an Anglo-Saxon expert. Hence the very fnnny English we meet with in connection with continental medioines, eau-de-cologne and the like, Take the nostrum ' under notice. The intelligent reador of testimonials has to gather for himself that " thee ting" refers jto the teething .trouble, of childhood. The teiti monials get a little nearer the- mark when they "Uifc " theething." .It is rather 8am Wellerian to .ay that the remedy ■! rill" do this and that —tho author is Tery proud of this "Till," for he'repeats it. We hope there is no hidden danger in this remedy, by the way, for it is stated that it "deverses" the attention of' parents, as was shown in the "chare" of a child; and "other" "chases" are mentioned* One child was saved when it was " thougth " it would die, and two day's afterwards,"two theet" came through, and later on six more were visible, 'f which hat long remained con cealed in the skin, and which pierced- without, pain. One'relieved parent was so pleased with the cure that " he musst beg of jou " to send him some more.
