It would be unfair on his part to detain then) many minutes but before he pronounced the Apostolic Benediction he could occupy their time for two or three minutes He had to thank them for what they had done and for that patient and laborious attention which they had shot, with regard to the work of the church His Lordship was sure such labor would not be In men in the Lord if it had been bestowed in the spirit of faith and prayer and of faith in prayer But perhaps they might ask if it were not possible for them to feel a great interest in the things about religion and not be interested in religion itself. It was a distinction that each should ma! e for his own guidance for he would remark the representatives of the laity were expected in every house to be representative i he had shown an interest in the church which existed not for the mere purpose of building up the frame work, but to build for Immortal souls by the machinery which they had at command and God grant a reward to them in that great benefit which was intended to be produced through the church a instrumentality What they wanted was that time should be faithful and his Lordship thanked the laity for the faith fulness they had evinced and their disinterested and business the consideration of the subjects brought before them with a design to promote the church a good But I he would observe also, that faithfulness was required Hutmill In thntpirtnf the work of the church but it was required of them that they slioullsetmioxuuiplewliich would have recollect of stirring,, up other members of the laity The) should also show an appreciation of the ordinances of Christ s Church b) mining to them and themselves deriving the benefits they were luUiude I to connuiinliatc And faith fulness required of them also that as faithful and true states mon strides I the law and the history of the country they should examine for themselves the constitution of the church its historical sanctions so to speak His Lordship especially recommended over) fireman to do that to examine maintain the grounds on tv which the church did appeal to the people The) professed to throw off the errors which formerly prevailed in the church It was the great principle of the Reformers - and his Lordship believed In that they were guido 1 lit the Spirit of God that they should go back to the old ways and recognise the voice which once joined in that beautiful service the Institution of the great crowning service of the church the Lord a Supper Phot had the records of the primitive Church to which they could appeal and they might ask men of white or denomination to do the same and not only that but they could ask whether He had get on instructions as to the order of the external machinery of the church They had heard in the course of of the session about orthodox! and the press had also alluded to It, but his Lordship asked who was there that dare to define what was orthodox or heterodox? 14 as It to be like the shifting compose ster not oh sing round a centre and that centre a cert lin individual r Or had there been a force from without to tell them what orthodox) was! Were they to be subject to shifting sand on which to build the church, of Orthodox! there must be and there must be orthodox) not only as to the teaching of Christ but also as to the discipline and order she) must take all that was rotcaleil'and not determine for themselves it li It was important or not Whatever came from the lips of the Master was binding on the church. There tins the difficulty determining the Ulm of faithfulness to the church, and of charity to all men If they would be faithful they must take care to keep the Uno distinct and while strictly faithful to endeavor to be doubly charity his Orthodoxy I What could this orthodoxy mean i A ere they to be bound by one 1 They ought to tie In one sense but there came one body before them. Let them look at the vi cleans How many members of the church held with that body as to the subject of imputed righteousness 1 Where they orthodox in the opinion of some Again the Baptists denied the necessity of infant baptism and contended for adult immersion Was that orthodox! The Lutherans denied the doctrine of original sin Was that from the church s point of view orthodox 1 The ItomanUts denied that the written V Lord of (sold was the sole rule of faith did they think that orthodox' and they came down to the swagman who denied that the Blesse J lion of (God is divine and that the Holy Spirit is more than an emanation from the father While there was orthodoxy as to doctrine, and as to discipline- and church order, there was an orthodoxy as to feeling that which required the heart as well as the head and they could not be orthodox If they did not love the Lord Jesus Christ in much and sincerity They might have certain scruples on the light of historical truth, and they (the church! had no right to blame them They ought, then, to have not only truthfulness of the head, but also of the heart and In that respect he the Bishop; was inclined to to as far as any, and to respect all who held conscientious views In one point he might not go far enough, but in this point of view he would condemn none for being unsound, but leave them to give an account to One above In conclusion his lordship said I request you my brethren of the clergy and laity to accept my thanks for the work you have done work, I trust which will be blessed of God, as work for that church which I try to commend to you to- day For that church pray, for that church work, and, if need be for that church suffer The Bishop then pronounced the Benediction and prorogued the session
