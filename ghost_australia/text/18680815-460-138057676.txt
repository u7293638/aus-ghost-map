I ATHLETIC SPORTS. PEDESTBIAHISM. J. G. HARRIS r. W. BEATHWAITE. OF SYDNEY, 160 YABD8, FOB £^o A-8IDB. ? : ' This long-lalked-of event vu decided last Saturday, at (be ILed-hou»e, Kortlmot^ria farour of Ur. Harris, in the roott bolbwsty]& imaginable, tbe Bydney man never having the ghost of a chance with hit more Drat opponent. Brathwaite's running was a great dieapphfot ment, as most people gave him credit for Toeing a better runner, and although Harri* mu the favourite at 2 and eren 8 to 1, yet aqofb re ports had been spread of the excellent t£tn» made by Brathwaite that a good race was ex pected. * As it turned out it was not wonh going across the street to witness. The only sport there was was in the 300 yards handicap race, which was got up on tbe ground, and for which nine went to the post, the winner, after a capital race, beipg Hooper, who had IS yvd» start, C. Barrass with 8 yards, and who can in his neual game manner, being Mcond. A gr^afc deal of time was spent in «n®Jdng the prpli* minariea for tbe great go-such ,as marking tbe ground, settling who should act as judge, umpires, and starter-and some difficulty BMW with regard to the Jatter, which was at last got oyer by Mr. Harrison consent' ing to act, and about a quarter-past four,(he men were at tbe post. After one or two attempts to get away, the pistol was fired, Harris baring about two yards start, which be made such good use of, that before half the distance waa run Brathwaite was oat of the race altogether, and Mr. Harris ran in the easiest of winners in 15$sec. This performance stamps him as an uncommonly good runner, and quite bears out the opinion expressed by a correspondent last week as to his quality. The winner was chaired in triumph round the ground, and a rush for Melbourne immediately ensued. There were over 2,000 persons on the ground.
