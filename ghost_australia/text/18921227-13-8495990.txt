PRINCESS'S THEATRE. " THE FORTY THIEVES." Stimulated by the lavish liberality of the management, the scenic artist, the ballet mistress, the wardrobe woman, and the pro- perty man at this theatre have combined to produce the gorgeous "Christmas Annual," for which the old Eastern story of "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" furnishes a pretext, and Mr. George Gordon has supplied the illustrations ; the only fault to be found with these being that they are too good to be appreciated by that demonstrative section of the audience which will howl its applause at the brainless inanities of a concert-hall song, and will fail to perceive or will only regard with frigid indifference, such a succession of beautiful pictures is those which this gentleman presented to them on Soturdav evening Ihise vveie worth) indeed of any theatre in Lurope 1 or the second scene of the first act Mr Gordon has painted a Mew in Greece, the central object in the landscape being a rock) promontor), crowned b) a Doric temple, near vv Inch he has placed the famous choragic monument of L)sicrates, and beyond them a far stretching expanse of wooded plains, gleaming sea and mujestio mountains, flooded with sunshine The fourth scene, nominally described as the Grand Bazaar m Bagdad is a picturesque street in tlie Coptic quarter of Cairo, the architectural vista of which, broken up b) all sorts of projecting lattice windows or meshrebiyas, is terminated by a gateway Hanked, by Saracenic minarets standing out, white and cleur, against the intense blue of anEgyptionsk) In the third act, the m tenor of Cassim Baba s house is a triumph of scenic composition, in the sumptuousness of its construction and decoration, its sugges tions of space and of oriental opulence und its general conformity with the spirit of fhe Arabian Nights 1 or the transforma tion scene, Mr Gordon and his son have prepared five pictures illustrativ e of tis many divisions of the globe the churchyard of Stoke Pogis aftei a heav) full of snow, and with a rudd) December sunset tinging the western clouds, has been selected us a representative ot I.uro peun scener) One of the ghauts at Benares, with the domelike pagodas and choultries rising up from the banks of the river, serves to typify Asia , and some of the ruins ot the colossal temples of Lg) pt with ' Pharaoh s bed at Philie in the distance, are symbolical of Africa Die wonderful Mirror Lake, reflecting in its unruflled w utera the great southern dome and the gigantic pines upon its shores in the Yosemite Valle), representa America, as the Stevenson Tails do Australia, and this succession ot character istic landscapes is the prelude to ' The lnumph ot Spring, a costal lake studded with waterhlies, and having naiads floating above it, stretches back to an apparently im mensc distance, and is brilliant!) illuminated by the electric light Next to the beauty of the scenery, the rich ness of the costumes, the picturesqueness of the groupings, marches and processional movcments, and the variety and animation of the ballets, arranged by Mme Duvalli, are the strong points of the production T he forty thieves, as they appear in the third act, are especially resplendent m their accoutrements, and go through their cvolu | tions like trained soldiers , and the spectacle presented by the stage when filled with those who take part in the bridal procession is one of the most brilliant things of the kind ever seen upon the Melbourne stage Incidental to this portion of the performance was a congress of nations-rmnee, Germany, Italy, Austria Africa, the United States, South America Britain, and lederated Australia being each symbolised by a young lady appropriately apparelled and bearing tne national insignia. Among foreign countries, Trance and Italy seemed most in foi our w ith the audience , America was warmly applauded, Britim vehemently so, and Tederated Australia more enthu siastically than all In the pas seuls, or ¿chos as the Trench call them Miss Alice Lethbridge lloats and flutters about the stane like a ball of thistle down driven by a. high wind, and re volvmg on her own axis with such velocity as to dazzle the ey is of the spectators, while always preserving a supple grace of movement, winch gives a rhythmic character to her dancing Miss Mar) W cir, w ho has been steadily coming to the front of late, also executed a serpentine dance, with so much rapidit) of action and accuracy of result as to wins well deserved encore, while the hallets, and especially the elegant dance of the Greek 1) rists in the first act, reilected gieat credit both on their organisers and their execu lunts In order to give additional variety to the per formance, the management have engaged the 1 aust Tamil), who introduce some represen tations of their classic statuary m the scene of the robbers cave Greek sculpture has no particular relevance to oriental brigandage, but considerations of this kind are ov erlooked in a Christmas piece , and there is no reason to be critical at such a season, or to inquire how a clown m motley came to find himself in a banyan forest angling for red herrines or how a gigantic frog happened to «wallow the bait It will suffice to say that the mci dent enabled Messrs Rexo and Reno to exhibit some astonishing feats of human con tortion, to tie themseh es into knots, as if they were compacted of indiarubber, and had no bon) frame work, and to exhibit an almost incredible flexi bility of limb and movement If they had concluded their exploits !>v turning them selves inside out, as is the habit of the jelly fish, nobody would have been justified m feeling astonished at such a climax to their contribution to the evenings entertain ment In the old Christmas Annuals which were once to be seen on every draw ingroom table, the illustrations and the showy binding vveie everything and the letterpress was of very small account And so it is with the modern pantomime In point of literary composition it is unspeakably weak and poor, and of character drawing ev en for purposes of bur lesque, there is none at al! Hence there is nothing in the parts of Ali Baba and of Hassarac respectively of which very much can be made by Mr E J Lonnon and Mr G H Snazelle, by whom they are sustained But the irrepressible humour and "go ot the first, and the clever singing of the second, helped to cover the poverty of their characters, and they will no doubt develop something comical out of them as they proceed, night after night, and "Ah Baba, as thus edited, may become as divert- ing m dialogue and incident as it is attrac tive and beautiful to the eye In the mean while they have to depend upon concert hall songs and upon the inspiration of the moment for the means of exciting the laughter and applause of the audience On Saturday evening the two great \ocal successes w ere Mr Lonnen s duet with the ' Little ÎNipper, and a. remarkably clever imitation by the latter ("Muster Harry ¿etter) of the former s ' Down the Bay, or larrikin song lins created such a tumult of approbation among the occupants of the gallery that tlie emull representative of the suburban rough w ho looked like Mr Lonnen seen through the wrong end ot an opera glasa, was recalled so often and so persistently encored as to check the progress of the per formance It goes without saying that Miss Kiltie Barrie makes a most engaging Ganem, and infuses into her acting Bingmg and dancing an abundance of that vitality with which she appears to be surcharged Miss Lelia Rose presents an attractive Abdallah, and Mr Robert Bolder who plays the pait oi Alia wile, Buccetds in doing so humorously and without the slightest truce ot vulgaritv In deference to.tradition and custom the pantomime concludes with some harlequmide, invented and arranged hythe IaustTamily but the previous entertainment is so ample and various that the balk of the audience leave the theatre at the end of the trausfor mutton scene Clown and pantaloon, har Icquin and columbine are only the ghosts of their former selves and haunt the theatres at Christmas time from the force of habit only The Forty Thieves ' will be repeated every evening for on indefinite period it may i be safely anticipated I
