POLITICAL HUMBUG. IT is really, says the "National Advo- cate" (a Government supporter), a very jolly little party which meets at Macquarie- street, days and nights, and plays the game of bluff and mystification. Mr. George Reid flits in and out a substantial but ineffective ghost with a grievance, and tries to disturb the happy serenity of the Assembly, but fails. Premier and Labor Party understand one another thoroughly, and co-operate in a happy game of hunting. When a measure for which there is understood to be a popular demand, but the effect of which would be disastrous, is brought forward, it is promptly rushed through with a quiet wink to the Council, and that much-abused body steps between the people and the humbug, thus robbing the game of most of its danger.
