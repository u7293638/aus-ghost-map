The pedlar placed the knives back in. his pack, and then commenced to devour huge pieces of beef and bread which he had brought with him. The countrymen having drank their beer, rose, and bidding Peter good-bye, and mumbling to themselves that yon stranger was a mighty ¡ uncivil chap, and they didn't half like the looks of him, departed.. The pedlar's meal being finished, he lit his pipe and began to smoke, but fatigued with a long walk, he soon laid his head on the. taMe and fell asleep. About half an hour after this, when the pedlar awoke, the stranger was gone. Strapping his pack, he proceeded to look for his stick! It was not here. "Well, well, said he, " I could have sworn I brought that stick in with mo 5 but I suppose I left it up at Daniel's place ; 1*11 just go back and see. I wouldst lose niy cid horse for money." Cheerily stride the pedlar up the hill leading to old Keen's-house, He was an honest, faithful old man, and his .occupation led him through all parts of the country. Ho had imbibed a strong love for the natural and the picturesque. The virw which.' spread itself before him as ho rose - to tho crown of the. hill was beautiful. He sat for some time drinking in its beauties, till "the fading, light of sunset warned him it was time to be moving. Arrived at the house, the pedlar knocked at the door, but receiv- ing no answer, he pulled the string, as he was wont, and pushed the door to enter, but it was fastened. He tapped again and waited, but still no answer came. . -Daniel Keen's house was situated in a lone place, "and was a much larger one than wa3 nocessary fora single man. But he was rather a strange old fellow, and though the squire had offered to build him a comfortable cottage and let him live rent free, he had refused. The house was his, he said, and it woidd last bis time. Ho was birn iii it, and he would die in it. He was at times strange in his manner, and the villagers said he had never been right since his wife died, and that she, poor thing, had been killed by the unfilial conduct of their son,:who eight years since had left his home, and had never been heard of since. All sorts of gossip got about among the villagers-how be was mixed up with a gang bf thieves atd plunderers ; and bf course none of the tales failed to reach the mother's ear; . . There wa3 à sort of bond betweenbid Keen and the pedlar. For the pedlar's son had been mixed up in the same affair as young Keen, and the two bad decamped on the 6amo night, but whether in company none could say. . ; Thé pedlar waited a few moments, then tapped .again. He was beginning to .feel uneasy. It-was tob'early, under ordinary circumstances, for "old ? Keen'', to have retired to rest, and he feared he jriiight be ill. ' " j r; When he had knocked again-he listened, for I he fancied hq heard footsteps descending the ;stairs. y They approached the door softly, and he 'heard some one breathing shortly and quickly on the other side of the door. , . v . : ; . 'in another instant; the door was . opened, the pedlar, entered, and it was. quickly closed again and the bar dropped. , '"»? ?

" Surely," says I, " that's never old Keen," and I knocked nt the door. The light had come into the sleeping room just before I knocked. As soon as I had, I heard foot- steps go back up the stairs, but nobody came to the door, so then I looked in at the window. The shutters had not been fastened, and there I saw a terrible sight. The candle was on the table, and on the floor lay a man, poor old Daniel, and I think. he was dead, for his face was white, and there was blood on his clothes and all over the floor. Just as I was alooking iu there was a noise and a cry, then a groan. I can tell you, mate, I was to scared I didn't stop for nothing, but run off here as fast as I could."

They were, therefore, obliged to return1 and find some moans of opening it.' Meantime, let us return to the, pedlar. No sooner was the door closed and barred than a hand was on his shoulder. His feet were knocked from under him, and he fell.heavily on. to the floor. He attempted to rise, but a blow from an unseen hand laid him prostrate, and the next instant a mist floated before his eyes/and the next minute ho wns unconcious. When he re- covered his senses tbore was a light on the table, and a man with his back towards him was in the act of wrenching open one of the cupboards. ' The pedlar started as though he would rise. And the movement caught the quick ears of the robber, and he turned suddenly round. As the light flashed upon his face, . the pedlar uttered a cry, exclaiming, " Heaven have mercy on me, it is my own Fred !" "Who are you ?" cried the man, springing to- ward him, but he suddenly recoiled. "My father," ho cried. " Oh, Heaven, have mercy ; I did not mean to harm you. What cursed chance has brought you here ?'' At/the sight of his son, the old pedlar closed his eye3 and sank back horror- stricken. But in a moment he opened thom and fixed them on his son. " Oh, Fred, my son," said he, " is it thus we meet?: Oh, would to God that I bad never lived to see this day." . '. Í ; Tho son cowered before tho meek uplifted eyes of tho father. He stood for some minutes spell- bound. The pedlar's lips moved as if in prayer, a shudder seemed to pass through' his,frame, and his eyes closed.

" Where can the old fool have stored' his money?" and he' proceeded once more to search the house. ? ' After a time he noticed a door rçhich he had not previously opened. There was no key, buta blow from his powerful arm and it flew open. At first the room seemed/empty, but a second glance showed in one corner an. iron-bound box. To break open the box was- the work pf a moment, and the next a heap of shining gold lay before him: ? . . ... \ .vv ,. With ; a cry of exultation he commenced to transfer it to his .pockets'.' When he had secured it ali, he seized his candle and descended into the room below. T-here lay.the bodies of his father and Daniel Keen. He was just looking at the pedlar's body, and thinking he wa3 showing signs of breathing, when he was alarmed by a loud knocking at the door. He hastily set down the candle, and rushed upstairs. In a minute or two after there was a cry, a noise as of the falling of some heavy body,,and a deep groan; then all was still. When the three men returned to old Keen's' house, they brought with them a lantern and a crowbar. The door was forced, and a sorrowful sight met their view. The room bore evidence of a struggle. Before them lay; the bodies of the two old men, weltering iu blood. .On'examining tho body/of tho.pedlar it was evi-, dent that life was not extinct, and one of the men set off lo tho village to give the alarm,, and to procure medical aid. . ... . In the meantime the other two proceeded to search the bouge. As they ascended the stairs they were alarmed by a sound, but from whence it proceeded they could .not exactly, tell, but it seemed as though it came from an upper room. It was a low, hollow sound, as1 of some one in. pain. They stopped to listen/but all was silent; They advanced slowly and cautiously up the stairs, for now they felt certain that tho murderer was in the house; and though they were not, positively cowards, they feared ho might spring, upon'thein unawares and at any moment! r fÄ- . ; On they went, now startled by the loud creak- ing of the stairs, and now alarmed by . the eöhp/of their own exclamations of terror. /vi;C:X-r-u , . Then came a low wailing, a's -if' thé 'yrûdÇ.^râÀ iuoaning, in melancholy cadence, in the trees o.ut »de, and they stopped again. Was it the wind, or. was it a human cry ? j.' . 'i ^: '' ; These were tho questions they asked each other again and/again;, as they proceeded, with many stoppings * and great excitement and searched every room in the house. On their return they lodked.in at the rooms that had been shut up. iAt ono moment they thought "they saw.a form moving in the dim shade at one end of the room; Just at "that moment à gust of wind extinguished the candle, which one of them' had incautiously taken out of tho lantern, and;they were left in darkness. .'' ' Without waiting for anything more the twp men made their way downstairs and procured another light. At this moment'they were joined by the doctor and his assistant, together with the' village constable and others; and now, emboldened by numbers, they ¡searched the house thoroughly,', but no trace of the murderer could be discovered.' The doctor pronounced Daniel Keon to be dead. But there was life still in the pedlar, and he hoped for the best. :. "¡. :-:;l. .;,V ,.y The excitement? was great in-Aspendale the next morning, an|d; .in the courso of the day it reached as far as WeBt Cornford, and strange rumors were circulated. v ; Circumstances also transpired which, in the, minds of most people, seemed to fix the murder upon the pedlar. Tho instrument with which the deed wa3 perpetrated proved to be the very knife.which the .countryman," Brown, had refused to buy on account bf the flaw in the blade, and which was known to have been in his possession a few'hours before'the murder was discovered. Some said that the . pedlar himself was'des- perately wounded ; but others said thatli that was' no. obstacle to his guilt, as . the old man might have turned upon him. ' »; 1 Another thing which favored this idea was that ^though the pedlar had partially recovered, he réfused to give any account of:the transaction.
