HAUNTED BY HARRIET. BY F. W. ROBINSON. I don't know that it will take me very long to get this story into shape. It is not a long storyj arid I am a short man, I mean short in action and speech — short andsharp —for as to my height, if it is. any satisfac tion to anybody I may as well state at;once that lam five , feet four.] -j£y .riame is Gubble, arid at the' timeipf which I write Sblombri' Dredge, solicitor, of Greenmould ' street, Spitalfields. . ... ,.-j~ r i i Spitalftelds was neverafamous place for i solicitors, but tlier'e were a few of us about there— riot of the highest standing, perhaps, but we.did ,a .goodish, bit ,bf business, and 1 saved, many a client ifrbmrusliing .West to fool his cash away out of the; parish. Old ' Soloiriori Dredge, did, perhaps, more busi ness than, most of',the,!far East solicitors;; he had been longer established, and was wellTkio;wn as a i sharp, close-rfisted, iron-, clad 'old gentleman, who knew as much as most folk. When his brother was living — Dion Dredge— the ? 'firm of Dredge and Dredge was known in the profession as 'The Knives' arid well it deserved the appella tion. .A sharp firm-— very.. Itdidalot of business with ladies and gentlemen from Whitechapel, who were always getting in to .trouble from some cause or, other;.. it was clever at' county, court; and police court cases, and absolutely great at lending money ,. to needy, shopkeepers, and selling, them up,' root and branch, stock and stone,1 when the money, was liot forthcoming They were days of rich'hauls, too, those good old days, and Solomon .Dredge was said to be wealthy. Yery .probably lie was, for lie' never spent his money, and wore the same, old long, snuff-cplored coat that he was. married in' forty years ago. That's what people 6aid '^ about hiiri in Spital fields. ? .,.,. .,.. .... „. .„-.. '? .However, he was a. sound, sharp lawyer; and 'those'' yery1 same scurrilous .people, when ' they . got .into ' ' diificultie's, were, al-r ways glad' to have him1 on their side. ; He did his .duty, .byr them and was not too par ticular. .He had, a'gfeater stock of wit nesses -for ''the!, defence'.td.draw upon than any other 'solicitor I have ever known-|7-. alibis who . would ^'swear to , anything for a' five-poundnbte— a few of them for as. small an: .amount as ftye' shillings, when times were extra hard. Wonderfully cheap wit nesses ! — and generally to 'be relied upon./' ? Of late days when Solomon Dredge was getting, and looking, an old man— he owned to' seventy-fivei and' looked eighty-nine or thereabouts— :he ,. had ,nothshown that tre mendous interest' and energy in business for , which , h e '' had ibeeri/remarkable. , He took long spells of rest;: at .his house, in Hackney-road, went sonietimes! into the country, Deptfofd way; for change of air, .and... left more.pf the business in iny h'ands-' soi 'much,; at .last,, in my hands,, that every day ;: I thought that he had ?, made up ,' his iriind' to ' take me into partnership. I hiid been thinking ,he .would do,this for the last tWnty-five years or thereabouts. I had been building upon it. ,1 was riot, a quali fied' solicitor, but that would not have mat^ tered,, a. great deal— that can always be mariaged-rand I ' may say [at once that he riever. did take me 'into partnership, but died.the same; selfish, testy, unprincipled, iriercenary old rip' whom Jl had. known all my life. I dpn'tmind. saying as much, as ;thdt ribw., ,1 only wish I Could have mus tered' up courage to. say it to his leathery bid chop's ', before, .they.carted.him away.to ;Kensal' Green, 'where he [had got a bit of ground, dirt cheap— for ari overdue : debt— frpm!his. prie.'rdckety/. nephew,' ^libihad run .tlirbugh, all, his! fathers , property, like , ^wildfire!

' i ..Solomon Dredge was at Deptfbrd again when' the- incident occurred which I have! thought it well to write out while I havo a notion' pf. it all., He, had been ailing— felt a bit .nervous, could,not; account for ;a nasty pain, in his chest, and a nastier pain in the small; of his .back— arid I had not seen him for five days. ' Busiriess;was .riot brisk— it- was- Christmas V,',time V nearly;— arid the jweathe'r was'.tpp bbld;for people ? to go to law.. JI was sole; cleric— there was no one under me;, from morning; till night I. had had for five days the office all to. myself. ' I may reniark here that I was'a single man, and always slept in. the office. ? Air Dredge ithbught it was .safer' to have someone: on ithe premises', arid ' deducted ,'a . certain ^amount per week— trust him for that 1-rfor :rent from- my miserable 'pittarice. Arid it \was-, a, miserable' pittance,' ? although I had put a little money by— just enough to bury, me decently, or indecently ? accprding to the' taste, or want of taste, of my execu tors. , I did, not much care-how it, was,' . I had not much -interest in the transaction. .1 had grown :tired of life and the law. I !doubt if even I had-been offered the part inership' whether .it would: have stirredme ;up much. , I was sixty-eight, arid had gout in the knees.' 'Invidious- and .untruthful folk said I looked, older than Sol' Dredge. ' Let me say here .arid for the fair coinpre .herision of what follows, that I wns not a jnervous man, that, I had not an atoiri of fdncifulness. in. -my, composition, that my affections, impulses,' tomfooleries had dried !uP l°°g ago, and- that I was asmuch apiece ;of: parchment as the deeds I.sbrnetimes en Igrpssed for ther principal arid, client. In deed, . I, had prided myself for many years upon my cool, grave/business-like stolidity. jl had had so little to' iexcite men in Green mould-street since yourig.

But I ! liked the lad. I.' never snid so ;. and I am isure he never .guessed it. ' I don't know iwhy I should have liked him either, for 'he_ identified me always with his uncle, and | said . hard ; things and called me harder ? names when he was in, his cups, which was not at all unfrequent. , There was some thing in himtp like— perhaps that was it. He was so full, of .life,; he was always so ;much in earnest;; .he/had so supreme a con tempt for his uncle and his uncle's ways ; ? he, protested- so, warmly against anything which , was, to,, his- mind, .: base aud mean;,, he was! so! unlucky; he did such foolish acts—that was why I liked him. Contrast of character; admiration of a man , who did not care for ; irioney, and who ; defied,' Old , Dredge— perhaps all that ; accburit'ed for my lildng hiiri on the quiet ; but r, he ? never guessed, it — never credited : me with possessing, at that time, any human feeling. ?- „ . i Arid yet when his uncle sold him up and 1 settled-him, I cried behind the door of the I iron safe,- and cursed my master, and hoped'tlidt a judgment, would come home to him;, but no one knew it, guessed it, dreamed of it. I. was only old Gubble. ! Ijfirid I am wandering in my narrative after all. I am diffuse. This is like being i paid per folio. -Let me get on. Dredge, ?'. then, aa aforesaid, had been luxuriating in. Deptford some fire days. It was a wintry/morning,, and. there were ugns'pf snow in the air, and now and then a handful of snWflakes would flicker past the window panes !as if they presently meant business. . I do not, asa rule, take any notice ' of external matt era ' when I am at riiy desk. When .Solomon Dredge, was in the office you may be sure, I. did, not, .as he would have, deducted such inattention from ;my salary ; but , I, remember .that ;on this day I looked up once or twicp'from the draft which I was' copying, as tliough the; first flakes of the season were of; ;some little interest .to .me. And the second tiirie I looked iip ' I became aware' of a piile, pinched, woman's face looking 'over^the wire blind at me; I scowled:;.back at the female, and, resumed my1 writing; ;iind she disappeared; There was. .nothing uncommon in anyone looking over the wife blind into tlie office— it occurred now and then— and ,1 thought no. npre of the indtter. . .Tall men arid women, ' as they passed, glanced in occasionally, arid little boys had;beenrkriownto, climb 'upon each other's shoulders, arid take it in turns to see'what was goirig-'ori inside. .' There' are some folk who will bo curious or dieforit.' Ten' minutes afterwards the light outside was again obscured b'y the, interposition of soinebody : between it and the;' window glassj arid there ' remained a fixture '( till I looked up again. It was a dark inbrning and I wanted all the light I could get without - interfering with . the gds-burner, which 'Mr Dredge did; not like anyone trifling with, and the thick .head of even one observer made a difference.' I looked up'sharply at last, and there was the same woman again, glaring in at me with an anxious stare. ' . . ' ;I: shook ? my head' at her. I squeaked put, .' Go away !'V—I have a piping voice, with a natural tremolo in.it— but the woman took no. rnotice/.-and continued.to stare in, arid by degrees the face made an impression upon me that was peculiar. , I began to wonder what the woman wanted, why' sheiiad cpine .twice, to ? look in ,at me —what there was of interest in- this grimy, dusfe-driedr office,. or in. this grimy, dust dried OTe,'t'o'keep her staring there. _ She must be a tall moman to look so-easily over the blind, I .thought, ' arid . her face was so white and, haggard- that it might have stood for a death's head, framed in a rusty crape bonnet, , with rusty .crape flowers to match, surmounting it.;. And'the eyes.were, so full of ''sorrow, ''had such a woebegone ^expression -in- them, that they began even to affect' 'ine,: as' parties susceptible , to mesmeric influence are affected, I have heard ; not that I ever believed in all that jribnsense. myself.. ,.i thought I: had better, : stare this woman putj ana after a' while' II succeeded, for the face was withdrawn. , {from the window, arid , its owner went; saiivay, . The woman, was not long upon my Imind, and with: :'a pen in my hand ..'and, a. j deed before me 1^ was, bound to go ' on,' just . as a clock is bound to go 'on ftill run down! for good. For, hdlf- an-hour i proceeded in' ; my usual way, when suddenly, almost with, ajerk this time, .up rose that saturnine . visage over the blind once more. ' ';,.' ' '' ! 'Bless my soul 1' . I ejaculated on this' i occasion. .1 caught iny self saying, it.' . X' was completely surprised, calm arid', un-, amoved as I might have been to her. What1 'did she want ?i If it were business, she :-v^ould have kriocked just as readily as, Mother people did, ,and, I could have .pulled' the chain and admitted, her, and listened, to,' her case. But to stand staring there was: partipularly objectionable. ? ' ,,' i This time she was not so long surveying!, : me and the premises; she probably knew; me by heart now;- for' before I could make' ;up ray mind how. I, should resent this third.; intrusion, she had once more disappeared';': I only to return, though, in about twenty, iminutes, and look in as hard as ever for a: minute or two arid again retire. This was' getting too much of a joke, and I was, 'actually getting neryous— 1- Silas Gubble,: iwho had never been nervous in all my life; jbefofe. All tins very! much of a coincidence^ of course, easily accounted for -if one only; held the clue, but ', nevertheless inebmpre iheusible to me. , |The .woman was probably' jwaiting for someone, and, tb while away! ? thetime, looked in over ; the blind every' ;tim'e she passed, tb: see how I was getting; : on. Very probably she was annoying other, i persons down the street in the same; fashion, and they were equally as per-! plexed. There would be a row on shortly,', I thought ; some rieighbors I knew would' Snot stand any persistent joking of that1 description. It. did not' matter to me so' much. , If it amused anybody to watch me' — why, let them beairiused. . It was only! a pity that they^were so easily pleased. It 'was only ? . ,,'? ;-'...,,., .: ., ! '.': There she is again 1 . . Yes, too much f of a joke. .Iwas quite'. ;right. It was. !,I found I began to think! leas of my work than of the woman outside^', and to wonder how long it would be' before! she looked over the, blind ? again, and. how; long I was, expected, ;tpi sit, and bear the infliction.. *Nb brie came to tho office! that' day to relieve, the i riibnotony of the day's, routine. If anybody , had , called I should have told him all about it,r arid niade a bet with him when the face would; reappear.', I was getting demoralised. I foundmysell: writing down in. my best round hand— '* Payment to be .made on. thd usual day's for payment of rent— viz., Michaelmas, Christmas, Lady-day, and Yesterday' and; a little further on ' the woman to have immediate right of poasession-'^— the tenant' being Gowan, the, butcher in. the next; street— when the face once more rose like^ a jaundiced moon andjpeered in. I ' coul'dj1 stand it no longer. There was something too uncanny about it. !? The woman would drive me out of my inind. I was not used' to this kind of , thing at all. I jumped; from my stool and shuffled as quietly as I could to the street doorj which 1 opened, and then looked into the street. Of course, there was no woman., She was not going, to :b«: stopped and asked half dhundred questions by me. And the gout at my knees, hindered my getting' along very fast. There was almost the! whole length! of .Greenmould- street on my.: right — she had riot gone that way, unless she had 'walked into an open, doorway. There was no one dbont but a - little girl with a, stone jug, toddling to the beershop,L and the catsmeat tnan- ha]f\yay dowiiijthe street cutting , up hie 'ha'poilths,'''aud' surrounded by yelling felines in every stage of hunger, and despair! On!' the left there' were four doors between Dredge's office and, the corner of the next street, into which. she had probably elipped. I hurried past those, four doors and. peered round the corner. There was no tall being in a black crape bonnet in that direction either — there were two ; slatternly girls laughing with a baker's .man, a sweep. on the other side on the way. yelping dismally, and a police man tramping slowly away from me. A policeman I No ; he would only smile at me. There was ..'nothing, to talk to a policeman about. In tlie fresh air the whole thing seemed supreriiely ridiculous. I would go indoors and' have my , dinner.. I had my dinner,' in, the, office-r-Mr . Dredge always gave strict orders that the, office was not to be left for a single instant, on any pretence whatever. I,!spredd,;my; rsix ounces of brisket of beef !upon: thep- newspaper they had wrapped'it in a Sweatem's!- in Bishops-, gaterstreet,. produced my',!penny loaf and penknife and, set-to, work. The watcher! did riot come rduring! the ! meal. ' .Perhaps she had gone ! to ; dinner too, or had gone away for good/seeing that my; suspicions were aroused. . I hoped'; that!' siib had gone, away for good. ' I did not want; to Bee her any more. ( B.ut, I was not to ' be quit of heir so easily. -At halfrpast , three, when I thought she really had , gone, when I coriid almost fancy she had. passed but;bf my mind, once more that sallow, ugly, . crape bedizened;'jowl!rose over -the /street side of theJrwiridbw blind ; and' looked, lixedly at me,- .': ' ' ,?' .' ,',!';., ' ;? ;:'; .'';';:.. ' ' : ';' \- I felt little prickles at the roots of my grey hairs.. How! long was this kind of game likely to last?.. . : !' What the devil do you want '?' I shrieked put, in^ an enraged tbrie; but whether the woman heard ine or not I could not, tell. She continued to, look almost pathetically at me; but when; I. scrambled off my stopl arid made, fpr'the door, she vanished. ( At the door; and looking down the street, of course I .could not seed trace of her.- It was 'peculiar. and ghost-lilce — but I did not believed in ghosts, and I had never ': heard of ghosts turning up ' in tho daylight and looking .through people's windows with no other object, than that of annoying; those who, w^e inside the room. .It wds a real ari'nbyauce, too. It was a complete distraction from work. I seemed to have nothing else tpdobutwait for her, but she did not coine' again, before the blind was dpwn,!and Ihdd shut lier ugly face out; It was a relief tb ine^to '.light the gas ; but when I had clone ,wprk : and put away my papers arid had my. 'teii-^I never indulged in suppers-—I' was not quito sure, weary as I was, .that :I, wanted to go to bed.. I turned in early. as a!rule,'a little after nine o'clock, andtwaslglacl, to got another day over; but at nine plclock! that night Iwas wide'awake ,and staring. A wild idea of goirigf.fpr.. a'^walkjjas ,forr as Shoreditch Church, crossed .my' mind— of completely tiririgiinyselfjbut^of, slipping into the bar parlor; of the Codch arid Horses and trying conviviality arid four of Scotch — of seeing what they .were doing at the Standard arid the Penny Alharnbrd just by, which '.was a flourishing '.' institution:', at tlia.t time— of going' even as 'far , as. the Britannia— any- thing for a change. /,.'?.'''? «.r»' ' ''.

All, ?*ds very ?.'still1 iiv Greennioii.Ud-street. ' I recollected 'suddenly tlidt Iliad 'not-heard a:fbotf all for hours, and that 'it was prob able people were noiselessly' 'slipping/ past the' window.

Yes.it was; 'unearthly;,' T went to the wiudow; drew aside; the/Wipd,' aridlooked out. I 'soon dropped'the, blind and looked in though. The woman1 was there' close to me, her, riiiserable; counten ance only 'separated from, me by a sheet of: ?window glass. The blind1, had been askew after'all, and the objectionable1 female was trying hard to peer in and see' what I was doing now. ' Sh e was as startled as. I was— arid that was reassuring.' Gliosts are'npt likely to be frightened, ;themselye3 when taken unawares, although' I 'suppose : the}' must be subject to surprises now and' then.' They can't have, it '.all their' 'own 'way. in. churchyards arid 'haunted1' houses;, they must clash with' brie another ''ocbasion- '? At all events, this ghost, or 'this pertinar Cioiis female, was a ,bit , startled when I looked out suddenly. ' Th e hose ? had been flattened against the glass,, 'arid was-, as white and round at' ',tlie tip as 'a .shilling, a sign of real substantiality that was reassur ing to me, till IJ thought ''of 'burglary. Greenmould-street' bpre.an ugly reputation at' the further end,: where the /lodging- houses were numerous, and Old, Dredge was reported to beas rich'as'a1 Jew. Did the nefarious classes think'1 'Old Dredge's1 house was worth breaking into, and was this woman on watch,' to make sure'that there 'was no one else on the 'premises -but me? Was I taken , for Old Dredge1 himself, ilrid out of the many 'hundrpds^wlio owed my principal: a ' grudge, was there ? no' '.one' ?vvho could not tell the difference ? between that miserable old man and' me ?'Fan cy.be-; ing murdered for Old Dredge, and Dredge getting',' off;, scot free! '.Had',' -Dredge, ''? ;I' Tpbridered, been: trifling' with '.the;' affe'e-; tions'of this lanthbrn-jawed1; ?woman in the Crape bonnet, and, was she waiting to give him a bit of her mind? It was scarcely. in Dredge's way to be .after the girls'; ATas that womnri outside as mad as' a hatter,: and had she eluded her keeper; and; been pros pecting the oftice;'as a -likely place' 'of '.re - luge ? Or was it spine extra impressionable specimen of the sex who had!'takeri a sud den fancy to me,' and was mustering rip'her courage to come forward? Not likely this, but1 then what 'was likely? ''?'??} 'A. '; r Should I be iree.from her the next ?' day, or was I a haunted man- from .that time forth? That was the question .which kept me awake the greater part of the night, disturbed by my own. wild ? Speculations, and harassed by all the noises ivhich.' an empty house will iriakelafter dark. The first and second floors of the house were to let,::I may add, and had'beerito let for many, months. Solomon Dredge had' talked more than once of takingth' e first floor arid con stituting it his home;' but he had riot been able to beat down the 'landlord as to. the jrice yet, so he lived' still in the Hackriey rpad; and when a bit ^poorly, as hereinbe fore mentioned, he! 'sought ;fresh air at Deptford. He never-'1 went', far out of London, because of the .expense. -: '; \- I was glad the next' day; when I received a letter from him by the first post,' inform ing me that heshouldbe'at business, in the course of the morning.1 I had had1 no pre vious recollection, of .being' glad to; hear that he was coming1 to the office— it had been always a relief; 'to 'me to be sure he was going to keep 'away,- but on this occa sion I was positively 'pleased; ? J,I must be getting 'old .and foolish. That Jack-in-the-box woman, 'coinbinedwith the Bad night I had had1,' had disturbed' my natural composure.- To think that a paltry incident like that should have affeetsd-me 1. I' could not be quite well. I would try a tonic or ablood mixture in the evening, if I'didnot feel any. better; '? , ''' -;;-': ?? Yes, the snow had falleriin the ni^ht ; it had come down at last, ,iri lumps; : Green mould-street was choked .'with snow, arid they were shovelling' it off; the roof : all the morning as hard as 'they could,' there' being signs of a rapid thaw to follow. No decent female would ; come out 'such a- raw and sloppy morning: as -this. I was ? safe from surveillance that day,' at any rate. Besides; there could not be' any.
