General Shaw is busily engaged on his investi- gation into the state of our defences. So far he has been conducting his inquiries alone. The case against Murray, a Queensland digger, and Hannah Mullins, for having an illicit still in a house near Haymarket, has been dismissed, there being no evidence that accused owned the still or occupied the house. The jury in the inquest on the Penrith ghost case resumed sitting this morning, and further adjourned until Monday. The medical men still say that the bones found are human. A gold reef found three miles from Cobar has caused great excitement in the district, the land being secured by old miners all along the course of the reef.
