VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. IBvTeleeraDh.l I From onr own Reporter. I Melbourne. October 12. The weather during the last few days has been dead against outdoor sports of all kinds. Since I arrived on Wednesday we have . had rain every day, and as there are still no signs of it clearing op the tracks are not likely to be fit for fast work before the middle of the week. The soil at Caulfield ia sandy, and when racing began on Saturday the ground was still in fair going order, but before the Hurdle Race a drenching shower fell, and delayed the Btart some time. Afterwards it came on again, and before the Guineas waa run the going was so soft that the horses sank in it np to their fetlocks. The attendance was better than was to have been expected considering the weather, but few ladies ventured out. As might be ex pected, the day was disastrous to backers, the victory of Sandal in the Guineas being a great throw in for the ring, as Mr. Gordon's filly was supposed -to be dead off, and I have not heard of a single winner on the race. Of course excuses are made for the defeated favourites on the score of the going being against them, but neither Rufus, Tremando, nor David was in it at any parb of the race, and although Gratitude and flelene ran well Sandal seemed to me to win with plenty in hand. The triumph of the daughter of Winterlake is only another instance of the glorious uncertainty of racing. Ten days ago she did a gallop good enough to win any mile race, but was so sore afterwards that Dalton was unable to do anything with her until the day before the race, when she came out and ran five furlongs. Apparently the enforced Bpell was juBt what the filly wanted, and her action being admirably suited to heavy going she robbed Adelaide backers of a good win by settling the pretensions of Helene and Gratitude in very easy style. The good field of sixteen faced the starter for the Maiden Plate, and as The Bey was greatly fancied by the St. Albans stable he was made a 6 to 4 chance. In the race he was never prominent, how ever, and with Duration and Norfolk coming right away at the turn the latter stayed the longer and won a fine race by a short neck. Yately, who was looking in splendid form, was backed at even money when the betting opened on the Hurdles, but a good many fol lowers of Corrigan put money down so freely for Tantaliaer that the grey became easier in the market. Of the others Scobeloff was the only one backed for much money. The start was delayed some time, owing to the rain. When the flag fell Batt) quickly took Yately to the front, and at the first hurdle Scobeloff got mixed up in the crowd and fell. All along the back stretch Yately was promi nent, but two hurdles from home he blundered, and this mishap gave Sinking Fund an advantage, which the grey could not make up again, though he came very fast in jumping the final hurdles. Owing to the rain little was Been of the youngsters en gaged in the Great Foal Stakes, but as young Wilson was very confident, about Ringmaster he was made favourite, and after shaking off Ocista at the distance he won handsomely. Lady Adelaide slipped down, and Boase appeared to . get a nasty fall, but he quickly recovered. The twelve can didates for the Guineas were all saddled under the sheds, and nothing seen of themruntil they took their preliminary. The friends of Rufus seemed to think the race a moral, and the Williamstown colt came to 7 to 4, while at the last moment there was a run upon Tremando and David, and the betting done in the paddock was almost con fined to these three, the friends of Helene and Gratitude not caring about the weather for their fillies. The race is fully described elsewhere, and it is only necessary to say that Gratitude and Sandal were in front half a mile from home, with Helene third, and that while the race was confined to these Adelaide allies the two that were fancied were beaten every yard of the way by the despised outsider Sandal. The form displayed by Rufus. Tremando, David, and Leporello was very bad, and the Derby certainly looks very like a moral for Bargo, The Findon Harriera' Vase was a splendid contest, nearly all the horses jumping grandly in the mud, led bv Yankee Grab nearly all the way ; and Mr. Filgate says he had the race won when the horse blundered at the last fence, and left Chieftain to beat the ancient Abdallah in the run home. Meteor was served up very warm for the Toorak Handicap, but he had not the ghost of a chance with Precious Stone when it came to racing. As the result of the latter's victory his stable companion Conlston jumped to 4 to 1 for tha Caulfield Cup. Martini-Henry did a splendid gallop yesterday, and will probably come into the market for the Caulfield Cup. The following are the lesnlta :— MAIDEN PLATE, Of 100 sovs.. added to a sweepstakes of 3 sovs. each. For maiden horses, 3 years old and upwards.

Wben',they settled down Pole Star took up the running from Vasco, and Peut-Gtre, with Metal, Norfolk, and Mozart following, and the favourite leading the others. At the turn Vasco joined Pole Star, and Metal took third place just clear of Norfolk, Duration, and Peut- etre, with the favourite still lying off. Entering the straight Feut-vtre was leading; but Dnration quickly joined her, and entering the rails he and Norfolk came right away, a fine racB home ending in favour of Norfolk by half a neck Three lengths off Vasco just beat Pent Ctre for third place, and then came Vernet and The Bey, with Pole Star and Carbuncle bringing up the rear.

Going along the back stretch Yately drew ont from Sinking Fond, bnt he was soon joined by Tantaliser, with Dawdler, Star, and Concord well placed. There was no change round ing the far torn, but at the half-mile post Tantaliser and Sinking Fund reached tbe favourite, who blundered at the next hurdle and lost his place. Tantaliser and Sinking Fund then came on to gether, and jumping the last hurdle were together, but on latding Sinking Fund got away, and Yately coming again a good race home resulted in Sinking Fund winning by a length, with Tantaliser the same distance off third. Then came Tattler, Star, and Belle Brandon in the order named. Time, 3 ''''- lsec GREAT FOAL STAKES, Of 16 sovs. each, 5 ft, with 100 added. For foals of 1882, then 2 yrs. old.

Betting— 2 to 1 agst Rufus, 5 to 1 each Tremando and David, 8 to 1 each Helene, Merrimu, and Gratitude, 10 to 1 each Leporello and Sirocco, 20 to 1 SandaL They were kept at the post for some little time owiDg to Bohemian showing temper and refusing to join his horses. When the signal was given it was to a somewhat uneven start, the first to jump away being Bebus, Gratitude, Pilot, and Sandal, while three that got off very badly were Tremando, Lenorello, and Bohemian. As soon as they settled into their places Rebus took a clear lead ot Gratitude, with Sandal leading Pilot A batch consisting of Merrimu, Sirocco, Bufus, and Helene came next, while the rear was being brought up by David and Tremando. They ran in this order along the back of tbe course, but before the railway turn was reached Williamson took Gratitude up to Rebus, and the Sydney filly at once gave way. Sandal here took second place, with Sirocco, Memmu, and Rebus just clear of Helene, whose colours on the inside were now to be seen deserting the company of Rnfus. As they raced along the bend Sandal took her place by the side of Gratitude, and the pair came away at a great pace, while Helene, who had set all sail in pursuit of the leaders at the half-mile post, was now rapidly leaving Sirocco and Merrimn. Before reaching the turn Sandal had her head in front, and as they swept into tbe straight the race was seen to be simply a matter of staying home for the outsider, as Williamson and McGrade were hard at work on Gratitude and Helene, while Trahan was sitting still on Sandal, and bar the three Adelaide fillies there was nothing in the race. At the distance Gratitude made a desperate effort to get on terms, but though he struggled very gallantly Sandal always had the verdict in hand, and won easiJy at the finish by two lengths. Helene. who ran as true as steel, was steadied when pursuit became hopeless, and finished three lengths Dehind Gratitude. Some distance away Sirocco was fourth, with David fifth, and then came the disgraced favourite and Tremando, the last two being Pilot and Leporello. Time, 1 min. BOJ sec.

The start took place at the top of the straight and the lot came to the brush fence in front of the Stand at a great pace, the leaders being Yankee Grab, Barcoo. and Banyenong. They all got over this safely, and as they swept round the turn Mr. Filgate took Yankee Grab to the front, and led Barcoo and Ban yenong np the hill to the first fence. Here the fall ing began, but the leaders all stood np and Yankee led them along the back of the course, the most prominent of the others being Barcoo, Banyenong, Abdallah, Syphon, Clown, and Chieftain, who were rnnning in very close company about three lengths behind the white ? faced chesnut Yankee Grab kept his place over the treble in front of the Stand, and went up the bill with a clear lead of Chieftain, Abdallah, and Syphon, the others being headed by The Clown and Barcoo. Three- quarters of a mile from home Abdallah and Chieftain closed on Yankee, but the chesnut shot away again, and held a clear lead at the sod wall, where Syphon was second. After jumping this Syphon made a run at the leader, the pair coming away from the others; bnt at the laat fence Syphon fell, and Yankee, who struck hard, slipped npon the landing side and got rid of his rider. This mishap left Abdallah in front, but as soon as it came to racing on the flat Chief tian passed him, and holding 'his own easily in the run home, he won by three lengths. The Clown was a moderate third, with the others straggling in at long intervals. There were a number of falls, out no one was hnrt TOORAK HANDICAP, Of 150 sovs., added to a sweepstakes of 3 sovs.' each. One mile. Mr. J. D. Robertson's bk.h.
