GIIOSTS AND SPECTRES. THE SOUTH YARUA FREAK. Sydney Errington, a raw looking youth, who was arrested on Tuouday ovening on account of a complaint that he had boon acting the ghost and thereby scaring women and children, ap peared before tbe Prahrati bench yesterday on a charge of insulting behavior. Constable Murray deposed that at 9 o'olook on the oveuing named, in connequence of complaints whioh were made to bim by several Indies and children, ho proceeded through a right of way off Powell-street into Great Davis-street, South Yarro, and found Errington at the cornor of a lane. Ho was grotesquely "got up," and appeared to bo masquerading as a ghost. He wore tho red cap, falso beard and spectacles produced, and had pasted on hie obeeks un sightly piocos of sticking plastor, which gave him altogether a hideous appearance. Mr. Sievwrigbt (who appeared for the do- fence) : Are you awaro that anyone was frightened by bim 1— Yes, there was a com plaint made. "Were you far off when you came up to him ? (Loud laughter.) Mr. Keogh, P.M.: 7Mr. Sievwright, tho wit ness docs not understand the complicated way in whioh you question him. Mr. Slew/right: "Whom did he "insult"?— "Well, Mrs. Whittle's daughters. Mr. Sievwright said thero was no case. The boy was on his way to a gymn&stio; class, and put on some adornments to ainuse some children. The btnch decided to discharge the accused. Mr. Kcogh remarked that it would he just as well for him to remember that he could not go about iu thoso disguises with impunity. If he continued to do so, it was just probable that he would fall into someone's hands who would not baud him over to the police, but would take the law into his own hands and administer to him a severe ohastise- ment. Accused then left the court.
