THE HELP THAT COMES TOO LATE. It isn't tho thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, That gives you a bit of a .heartache At tho sotting of the sun. Tho tender word forgotten, Tho letter you did not write, The flower you did not send dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. Tho stone you might havo lifted Out of a brother' s way, The bit of hcartsome counsel You wero hurried too much to say, The loving touch of the hand, dear The gentle, winning tono Which you had no time or thought for, With troubles of your own. Those littlo acts of kindness , So easily out of mind, Those chances to be angels Which we poor mortals find — They come in night and silence, Each sad reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging And a chill has fallen on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late ; And it isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you have undone, Which gives you a bit of heartache At the setting of the sun. — Margaret E. Sangstbr in On the Road Home,' a Volume of her Poems.
