How d» you suppose she heard of our move, since she left the hop before any omskuew'of it 1 There wore a few other ladies there, I admit, for they wen; still with us when the orders came, and it had cleared by the timo we reached the depot.

It will be the very best antidote I know of— a few weeks in St. Louis society — if she has indeed, as you fear, beooiiiB interested in him. Go by all means ; it will do you good — do Winifred a world of good (gut her soi»e uew gowus, and take in all the pai-tirs and all the gaiety your pos sibly unn), nnd it will be a good thing for Miss Gulln-ie loo. ' Nuw, this is strictly entrc nous, llolden is worried about her, and iu course of a long t«lk we hud last night he showed me a letter just received from Mrs. HuluVu. Of course she ii all upset liy his having to take the field, and wants to leave th.: children with her niollier und couin up to him, but she couldn't be in cump, and there isn't a room to be had at tli- r.iilwny station. Tin; place is just crammed wiih newspaper men and quar termaster's people. Mrs. Holdon writes that ever since tlio night of that queer adventure self — strange, ne.rvoqs, nlmost hysterical at limes. Sin; will permit no allusion to it, and seuins striving to forget it all. Slio goes everywhere, morning, noo'i and night, but looks hngg'ird nnd ill. I gather from what Holde.n said that, ns you once surmised. thnrJ was an old alTUir which u-ay have had something to do with her persistent refusal of every o(Ti:r ; hut what that could have had to do with her fright at Pawnee I cannot im agine. Holdeu agrees with we, however, that it would be a capital thing if you and WiimiH would pay her the \risit she urges ; so agnin, I say, go by all means. 'By the way, I wish you would run over and see Mrs. Thorpe as often as you can. Her letters have a depressing effect on the captain, lie tells me the only insurance, he. has in nil the world is in the Army Mutual, but three thousand dollars would hurdly pay their debts and take care of them for a your if anything were to h:ippi;u to hili). Don't b» alarmed by newspaper stories of the lighted skies and howling ghost dancers. Indians will dance all night on any provocation, and our lires light the skies ijuitu as much as theirs. Sergeant Ellis, who volunteered to push through with dispatches to Buller's com niand somewhere on tliool her sideof Bud L:\nds, got back nil right this morning and says he hud hardly any difficulty iu working a way through tli» hosliles. Tlmt fellow, I think, is going to make a name for himself in this campaign. He is always ready for any thing that turns up. *?' 1 hear that Brtivste.r nnd Ridg«woy have hnd a row and do not speak.

Then Ivenyon got a letter.

' You remember my saying 1 could find that stolen picture if 1 could but have authority to search one room nt the post. ]t is oiy conviction still that the unui ulio goes by the nuuic of Ellis was the thief. He had i lock box at the poRt-ollice in town, number three, and -letters have been forwarded to him here: by the postmaster, two of which «r.rn not addressed to Sergeant Ullia or to G. 15.

And stepping into the waiting \vaggou he hide the driver go ahead, leaving the detective to come up in the post «tag.». That eveniiig he wrote a short letter to Rolfe, and the' gentlemen fro-u Chicago in dicted a long oua— both of which would have served to surprise that calmly superior sol dier not a little lud they reached him in due course of mail which, however, they did not.

Getting no reply to his missives and little encouragement nt tin: post, the strung'! civil ian suddenly departed after three days' ap parently aimless stay, and ihc next heard o' | him was in thu shape of a letter from Louis ville. Could Mr.j:-r Ivenyon procure for him nnyhow, nnyvvlier', n photograpli of Sergeant Elli* ? No, Mnjor Keiiyon couldn't, and was very short in Baying so. And now Uecumlier was conic, and the air was crisp and keen in the valley of the P.iw uec, thu sunshine radiant and sparkling ; but far to the north the wintry winds were how ling about the flimsy cantonment and- whirl ing the snow through every cranny nnd era. k, and the long nights on outpost n:id pic'tet were bitter cold. But through it all the vnr ious battalions of horse were sent scouting in turn around the reservation, and more and more the young warriors drilibied away from the agencies and were next heard of wel comed wilh accla-nalions by the savage hosts iu the fastnesses of the Bad Lands, and every hour increased the prospect of sharp lighting in the near future. But all tlm letters lo the anxious hearts at home were full' of hope and cheer, full of prophecy thai everything would soon lie set) led. The renegade bands were all ' located,' and being slowly hemmed in me i weiiui ivuuiu eui -is v^ni iscmas tinnier :it Pawnee after a1!, they hoped. And iu St. Louis Miss Guthria was exerting herself to see that her charming guests were having dm loveliest kind of a time. Dinners, lunch.ous, cards, theatrus, and diriciug parses followed in quisk succession. Tho new gowns were being made as f.ist as f amouU tmdistes could evolve and construct tlioni, and Winifred was rushed from one scene of gaiety to auoJier. 'Nothing could have been more oliaiinin^ than our welcome,1' wrote Mr*!. Berrieu (o her beloved Dick, 'nothing more delightful than the round of entertainments to which we are bidden. One has hardly time to think. As for writing, this is the first opportunity I have (tnjoynd in three days, and we are home from the theatre but half an hour. Mrs. Holden comes over every day, and mi ex change such news as we have of the dear old regiment and the dearer ones who arc our es pecial property. She is what I call a genu ine woman, and I like her more And more. I must tell you something I learned t/hrounh her. The day after our arrival . we were iu the library, and my attention was attracted by a large portrait, apparently a crayon copv of a photograph, llnit hung over the mantle. It vvas of a singularly handsome young muu, and I knew at once he must be a Outline.. 1 [t is my brother,' said Nitii, in such a sail, constrained tune-, ' taken just a few weeks before his death six years ago.' Of course 1 could ask no more, but, Winifred and I both noted how utterly liar face changed, liovv un speakably dislressed a look came into her eyes. We could see then why Mrs. Ilnlden should have said she was haggard and ill, and yesterday Mrs. llolden told me something of his story. He vvas barely twenty-two, the idol of the family and immensely popular in society. He was assistant cashier iu one of the big banks here, and o:ie. day the sudden discorcry was made that in some mysterious way, quite a large sum was missing, monc- for which h-: was responsible, but he could not account for it ; neither cor Id anybody ' else. The matter was investigated ] thoroughly. ; ' They had detectives every vhere, and ab solutely nothing could ho brought up ngninst young Guthrie. He never gambled, never dissipated in any way, was a model son and brother. Kita was wild with indignation at his having been even suspected. Mr. Gutlwie offered to make yood the sum twice over if need bi-, and tn bind himself for all his wealth to establish his boy's honor, and for three* or four days all wns excitement, and (hen, in the midst of it, poor Jack was found dead in his room, n half empty bottle of chloral by hih bedside.

Coining home late one night from a delightful dance their carriage stopped out side the massive porteoachere of Galhries ligmnstcad instead of driving right in. '?
