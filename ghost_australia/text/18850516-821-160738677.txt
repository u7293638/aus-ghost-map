SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB MEETING. Second Day. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] Melbourne, May 10, The South Australian Jockey Club were lucky in postponing the running of the Adelaide Cup until Saturday, aa although the weather was clondy and dull there was no return of rain, and the fact of the day being a half-holiday had a material effect upon the attendance. Neither of the stands were full, bat still they presented a very respectable appearance at the time the Cap was run, and I have no donbt the club will sustain no loss over the meeting. The pro gramme was spoilt by the retention of two such paltry races as the Maiden Plate and the Selling Hurdle Race, but the Adelaide Cup was one of the most interesting handicaps of the season, and the excitement of this con test fully compensated for the other short comings in the card. The victory of Lord Wilton was very popular, as the son of Countryman throughout his career has been one of those consistent performers which the public follow, and every one was heartily pleased to see him break the spell of bad luck which has attended him in important races during the past twelve months. Mr. Ellis won about £3,000 by the success of his horse, and several others threw in for fair stakes, but the bulk of the money was won in small amounts by the public. Three very moderate animals faced the starter for the Maiden Plate, and odds were laid on Hampstead, but he refused to try at any part of the race, and Capri won as he liked. Despite the heavy state of the fround Juanna was saddled up for the lursery Handicap, and well backed into the bargain. At five furlongs she was going at well as anything, but the weight told in the final straggle, and the well handicapped Remus drew away and won easily a length from Honeycomb, Ulalume, and Delami, who finished together. An hour elapsed between this race and the Cup, and during the interval some heavy investments were made in favour of Welcome Jack, who came from 20 to 1 to 10 to 1 before the nag fell. When seen the Maori crack was not liked, as he looked too big to race. Conjecture was trained to the hour, and remained a hot favourite to the finish; while Britisher and Lantern kept their places in public favour. The most popular horse in the paddock, however, was Lord Wilton, and the anxiety to get on the handsome chestnut caused him to advance to 8 to X. Pro metheus was lame, and friendless in consequence, but the owner of Plausible supported his horse freely. Nothing in the race looked better than Sardius, but nobody cared to back him owing to the feeling that he was held [safe by Lantern. The parade was led by Prometheus, Lantern, and Ruby, the last three to file through the gate on to the course being Britisher, Hobart, and Sardius. The preliminary canters bavin; through, Mr. Ws been got through, Mr. Watson took them in charge, and after Plausible and Conjecture had caused some delay the flag fell to a good start. Lantern was on his legs racing while the others were thinking about it, and he made play to the River turn before Nicholson could pull him back and allow Conjecture to go on in command. The favourite was never allowed to get far away, as Prometheus and Hazard stuck to her like leeches, and six furlongs from home the much- vaunted sister to Guess work threw up the sponge, and retired to the rear. Hazard was then left with the lead, but Lantern and Britisher quickly cut him down, and as they entered the straight it looked odds on one of the two winning. No sooner were they in a line tor home, however, than Lord Wilton—who had been in a good position all the way—and Anchorite joined issue, and with their advent first Britisher and then Lantern died out, without being able to offer the faintestresistanceto the new-comers, who went on together for a few strides, when Lord Wilton, answering gamely to the whip, shook off his antagonist and won by a length. Sardius, who was interfered with at the sheds, came with a grand rash when he got clear, and was only beaten by half a length ile by Anchorite, while Plausible alsoBhowed a bold front in the last part of the race. The winner was loudly cheered, and so was Sardius, whose splendid performance was a great satisfaction to his owner and trainer, more especially as he confirmed the trial with Lantern. Whatever chance the latter had was ruined by Nicholson fighting with him all the way, instead of letting him sail along in front. The time was very fast cons! ad. dering the state of the ground. After the race Mr. Watson had Moore before the Stewards for disobeying orders at the post, and the jockey was disqualified for three months. The Hurdle Bace fell through, but a good field of Bixteen saddled up for the Flying Handicap. Gymkhana being thrown into the. handicap she was installed fiist favonrite, but Bhe could never go the pace, and after Miss Merlin had made all the i running Middlemarch caught her at the \ lawn and romped home a ridiculously easy winner. During the afternoon the dispute between the [club and Mr. Blackler was satisfactorily arranged. The following is a description of the running MAIDEN PLATE. A sweepstakes of 3 so vs. each for starters, with 100 sovs. added. Weight for age. One mile and a quarter. Sir. D. S. Wallace's b.h. Capri, by Yattendon— Mandragora, 4 yrs. (O'Brien) __ .. _ 1 Mr. F.

Capri and the favourite jumped off flist and led Gohanna to the ahhatoirs, where he began to hang, and Gohanna went to the front with a two lengths lead of Bampstead, who was a length dear of Capri. Coming to the turn Hampstead went up again and entered the straight on terms with Gohanna, but at the distance Capri ran past the Iiair and with great ease won in a canter by three engths; a length and a half between the second and third.

Cross ing the tan Deiamia, Dlalume, and Juanna were in front, bntattbe half-mile jpoet Bemus had joined Jnanna, and these two, with Deiamia and TJlalume, were well in front. Entering the course proper Jnanna looked all oyer a winner, but she tired as they came on, and at the distance Bemus and Deiamia were well ahead of TJlalume, Juanna, and Boneycomb. From this ont Bemns kept a alight advantage, and Deiamia, stopping to nothing In the last few [strides, was beaten ont of a place by Honeycomb and Ulalnme, who finished together a length behind Bemns. Deiamia was only a head from tbe dead-heaters, with Joanna fifth, the lot being whipped in by Arsenal, Gasburner, and Can dace. Time, i min. 20 sec. ADELAIDE CUP.

Conjecture, 4 to 1 Britisher, 6 to 1 Lantern, 8 to 1 Lord Wilton, 10 to 1 Welcome Jack, 12 to 1 Sardius, 14 to 1 Madcap, 20 to 1 each Camerine, Prometheus, and Plausible, 30 to 1 Anglesey, 33 to 1 each Grace Darling and Anchorite, 60 to 1 each Hazard and Hobart. The start was delayed some little time owing to the fractiousness of Plausible and the anxiety of Moore to get away with Conjecture. Wben the signal was given the lot were in very fair order, but Lantern went off the mark like lightning, and before they had gone tlfty yards he was leading Lord Wilton and Conjecture by two lengths, with the others well together. Passing tbe Stand Lantern led Lord Wilton and Conjecture two lengths, with Welcome Jack, Hazard, and Pro metheus together at the head of the others, the field being whipped in by Sardius, Anchorite, and Gohanna. Before they had rounded the first turn Hobart, who was running in the body of the field, fell, and interfered with the rearmost division Sardius especially suffering. Lantern dashed past the wharf booth two lengths clear of Conjecture, on whose quarters was Lord Wilton, and then came Prometheus, Hazard, and Camerine, with the others well bunched. Bounding the river turn Nicholson succeeded in pulling Lantern back to his followers, and Conjecture went on in front, with Prometheus and Lantern together two lengths clear of Lord Wilton, behind whom came Britisher, Gohanna, and Hazard, the others being well bunched, with Grace Darling whipping in. Run ning along tbe back stretch Conjecture continued in command, with Prometheus at her girths and Lantern next, closely followed by Britisher, Go hanna, and Hazard, while the colours of Lord Wilton and Sardius were prominent at tbe head of the main body, the rearmost lot being whipped in by Welcome Jack, Anchorite, Anglesey, Buby, and Grace Darling. Passing the bridge Prometheus bad drawn almost level with Conjecture, and Hazard had taken third place, well clear of Lantern and Britisher still, ana two lengths behind this pair came Lord Wilton, Sardius, ana Plausible. Between hereand the abattoirs Hazard joined abi Conjectureand Prometheus, and tbe three ran abreast for some little distance, with Lantern pulling double lying with Britisher about two lengths from the pair. At the sheds Hazard took a clear lead and both Conjecture and Prometheus retired. The rout of the favourite was most complete, as she dropped back six or seven paces in as many strides. No sooner had Hazard taken first place than Lantern, going as Btrong as a lion, shot away from the rest of the field, and Anchorite's colours suddenly appeared at the heels of Britisher, while Lord Wilton took fifth place, Sardius, Plausible, and Madcap being the most prominent of the others. Bating down the bend Lantern and Britisher cut down Hazard, and with Lord Wilton and Anchorite in pursuit the two leaders rounded the turn side by side, both going veil within them selves. Entering the straight Lantern and Britisher still held a clear lead of their pursuers, and for a few strides it looked amatch between thepalr, but directly Lord Wilton and Anchorite challenged they were all abroad, and at the distance Anchorite and Lord Wilton were left in front with Sardius in hot pur suit. Anchorite stuck to Lord Wilton until the be ginning of the lawn, when he began to falter, and the cheenut struggling on drew clear, and won rather cleverly by a good length. Sardius made up his ground in grand style from the turn, and was only beaten by naif a length for second place, while Plausible, who also came wPh a brilliant run in the straight was a good fourth. Lantern was fifth, Britisher sixth, and Madcap seventh, the last three to pass the post being Buby, Hazard, and Prometheus. Time, 2 min 63J sec. WINNERS OF TIIE ADELAIDE CUP. Bider. |Wgt. 1864 P.

At the half-mile post Miss Merlin was still in lront from Pailleroo, The Ghost, and Arsenal, but at the distance Bobertson brought up Middlemarch, and catching the little mare two hundred yards from home he left her and won very easily by a length. Miss Merlin beat Arsenal by a length for second place, and then came Pailleroo, Meteor, and East Lynne. lime, 1 min. 17} sec. _ Thibd Day. Flemington, May 12. The Jockey Club Meeting ended to-day. The weather was beautiful, and there was a good attendance, including a number of ladies. Lady Bobinson and Miss Robinson were present. Racing began with the Hurdle Race, and as Old Soul and Chatsworth, who were heavily backed in the doubles the night before, were withdrawn on the course, there were only five left to compete. Minerva and Echo were about equal favourites, and after a grand race the latter won, but it was only Corrigan's fine riding that enabled him to gain a narrow verdict over Tattler. A fine field weighed for the Ladies' Bracelet, and after Remus had been installed favourite heavy commission was thrown into the market for Lantern, and he settled down in better demand than the two-year old. The race waB run at a cracking pace, and the heavy weights retiring before reaching the distance, a slashing race home took place between Vemus and East Lynne, the two year old winning through sheer gameness by half a neck. The steeplechase dwindled down to three runners, andColebrook, a very handsome horse from Ballarat, was made a hot favourite. The three jumped in the most faultless manner, and after getting over the last fence Colebrook assumed com mand, and won rather easily from Songster. Only five put in an ap pearance for the Charity Plate, and Titama bolting and throwing the rider the field was reduced to four. Surprise was backed down to 5 to 4, but after showing great pace be threw it up in the straight, and First Fop won easily. In presenting the Ladies' Bracelet to Mr. Cook Lady RobinBon re marked that next year she hoped to have the pleasure of making the presentation in Adelaide. The meeting wound up with the S.A.J.C. Handicap, for which twenty went to the poBt, and so open was the race re garded that C's and 7's to 1 were laid on the field till the flag fell. The result was a sur prise, as St. John came away at the home turn and won easily from Britisher and St. Lawrence. UURDLES. A handicap sweepstakes of 6 sovs. each for starters, with £100 added.

Echo, 4 to'l agst. Tattler. From a good start Yellowhammer and Echo made play past the Stand, the other three being close handy up to the river turn, where Echo drew away two lengths from Yellowhammer, with Tattler and Minerva at the latter's heels. At the abattoirs Echo led Tattler by a length, with Minerva heading the other two. They ran In this order to the turn, where Tattler joined Echo. On entering the straight Minerva was done with, and Tattler appeared to have the race in hand, but the lad on her took matters too easily, and Corrigan finishing with great determination on Echo, just managed to squeeze some half head in front of the mare. Minerva was a bad third. Time, 3 min. 25 sec. LADIES' BRACELET. A handicap race for all horses nominated by ladies only.
