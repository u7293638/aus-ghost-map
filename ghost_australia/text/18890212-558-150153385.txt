SUNDAY ACCOMMODATION AT SPRING CREEK. to the editor. Sir,—Yesterday (Sunday) wo drove to Spring Creek, and, of course, concluded we | would secure accommodation at the Coffee i Palace. Fortunately wo took our luncheon , with us, but counted on Getting a cup of tea ! all round. The driver took us to a scrub just in front of the Coffee Palace, hut the sun was so intensely hot that wo were afraid to remain out; en we drove back to the C.P., and on our arrival there were politely, hut firmly, sent about our business—in other word.*, turned out. There was iiot the ghost of a tree to bo seen, oud the other boarders objected to our sitting on the verandah. The landlady evidently took my husband for a spy of some kind. We were obliged to pick up our baskets and trudge half-a-mile, or more,- before a bush of any kind could he found. When fouud it was tco small to shelter all tur party, consisting of nine. So fed in batches, and left that inhospitable ! locality almost immediately after, vowing ! never to venture near the place again, or any other seaside Coffee Palace. Ouc hears inauy fcfcjries of excursionists to Geelong on Sundays who also tiud a difficulty in seeming refreshments. If they suffer as wo suffered yesterday from the want of a good cup of tea or coffee at Spring Creek they have my deepest sympathy. Such things should not be tolerated in a civilised community. Perhaps the C.P. laud* lady aud her boarders oonBider Sunday travelling wicked, but God gives Sunday as a day of rest and recreation, and such it is to townspeople, who rarely know what it is to breathe fresh ocean air, Wo have taken our last trip to Soring Creek, and hoDO our experience .vill prove useful to other visitors. I am, yours truly, J". E. II February lltb, 1SS9.
