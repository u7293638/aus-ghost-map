GRANNIE GAMP'S ECHO. By the Ghost or Sam Lovek. In the gap of Dunlo There 's an echo, you know, That blathers and blows to the bhoys iv Killarney. Ye '11 think in this stave That I mane to desaive, But I 'm none iv yer spalpeens that go in for blarney. Now, a few weeks ago, At the School of Arts show — In snug little Sydney this echo they thried on ; And, faith, I did drame 'Twas the very selfsame As the one that the Pats iv ould Kerry take pride on. One night, Granny Gamp With a crony did thramp To hear from this echo its wonderful talk, sir ; But the echo, it sames, Did n't care for their names, Nor the looks of the like, and it tould them to walk, sir. So Gran said to Gran, " It 's jist us that can Bate sinse into yonder bould echo so aisy, For if we both shout The same thwaddle, no doubt We '11 make up an Echo between us, my daisy." " Now, Sairy," said Sal, " Be ready, old gal, To cuckoo at night all I say in the mornin'." Says Gran Number Two, " That 's jist what I '11 do, Or bad cess to the counthry— the place I was born in." So Grandmother Gamp With her crony did thramp To a hole iv a place that they fancied would screen them ; And this is the way (It 's the thruth that I say) That they made up their pitiful Echo between them. Thus far and no father ; as the boy said when a policeman brought him to the gate of the Randwick Orphan Asylum.
