— DOGS IN CHURCH. j (To THE EDITOB.) See,—As an occasional visitor to your picturesque little church on the hill, I have come to the conclusion that a great deal of annoyance is caused to the church going community by individuals allowing their dogs to follow them to church. No one admires a faithful canine friend more than myself, but I am certainly of opinion that inside.a- .church is not the correct place for them, especially when in the midst of Divine service they commence snarling at each, other, which ultimately ends in a fight with all the heinous sounds peculiar to the canine tribe, causing of course a commotion, with any amount of tittering and laughing among old and young which should not be in a place of Divine worship. In conclusion allow me to give one bit of advice, that is that those who keep dogs, leave them at their respective homes previous to going to church, so that the attention of the congregation be not taken from the sublime to the ridiculous by listening to a lot of yelping curs. By inserting the above you will oblige, Tours, etc., VISITOR. Narracoorte, March 27, 1876. A man named Rixon has been arrested at Maryborough, Queensland, on suspicion of having murdered his wife. At the police-court investigation held on the 20th inst., he, says the Brisbane Telegraph, " declared that he saw the ghost of the murdered woman, who described to him the manner of her death. He says he then told the police, and hence he was arrested. The evidence is said to be very strong against him."
