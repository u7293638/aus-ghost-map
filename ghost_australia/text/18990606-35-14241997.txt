VOICE OF THE COUNTRY PRESS. The country press for the most part is vigorously advocating federation In some districts- notably on the borders and in the Riverina the campaign is an aggressive one, attacking provincialist reasoning in all its phases in the North, the South, and the West the newspapers, evidently animated by a strong federal sentiment, as well as by a consciousness of the material gains which will result from Australian union, are appealing to the doctors to carry the bill at the polls in certain towns where the disadvantages not to say the in- justices of disunion are daily manifest, and are exercising a baneful effect upon the industrial community, the newspapers are fighting what one might almost call a battle of desperation if it were not apparent throughout that victory is assured. The views of some of the representative country organs are published below. THE GOULBURN HERALD " It used to be soul that France was the only nation that would go to war for an idea of sentiment, and that Great Britain would go to war only to gain some material benefit, as the extension of her trade or the acquisition of territory Nevertheless it is quite true that sentiment has played an important part in the history of the British Empire, as witness the sacrifices made for the abolition of Bla\ cry, not to mention other instances At the present time the moto ment for the consolidation of the Empire is as much a matter of sentiment as of material gum It implies the union of the race, the mutual strengthening of its scattered parts, its defence against possible enemies, and the preservation of peace by the augmentation of its influence among nations. Material benefits, though not to be lost sight of, occupy the second place in the minds of Imperial statesmen The sentiment of Australia i union forms an element in the national movement, and consequently it is looked upon with favour and with hope by the Iraperi ii authorities A class of persons in Australia itself, however, affect to look with disfavour union and are exciting active opposition to the movement on the ground, amongst others that its advocates are actuated mainly by sentiment, and are forgetful of the sacrifices which its realisation may involve life magnify these sacrifices, mainly imaginary, and ignore the wider consideration of the advantages which the union may reasonably be expected to bring in its train Yet it will be found that the sentiment underlying the movement is really the most potent force all We are loth to accuse the opponents of the amende 1 Commonwealth Bill of being actuated by interests 1 reasons They appear rather to be swayed by two principal motives First, un ingrained conservatism, which dreads the creation of any authority that might interfere with their cherished ideas This is what is not improperly called provincialism Persons swayed by this method do not care to look beyond the borders of their own colony, or if they do it is to find reasons to continue suspicion and distrust of their neighbours the person unity of the chief leaders of the opposition to the movement gives force to this contention Thus Sir George Dibbs says, I may not trust the Yea to fans, and others follow in a like strain Then we note the excessive timidity which leads many persons to shrink from the idea of change We are well OUOULII us M o sure, they say These are the persons whom Shukospoare chara tensed-" oft we lose the good we might attain by fearing to attempt " This is not the spirit under the influence of which individuals become prosperous and attain influence Conservatism carried on to the point of obstinacy and timidity to the length of most of cowardice motives bushhouse to account for much of the opposition in the present case Other motives may have Influence, but theo scorn the chief We will not do the doctors of New South Wales the injustice of supposing that they are general!) influenced by these motives imbued with the sentiment of union, and reminded that their national interests have been guarded by their representative, men in convention and in con science, who would rather believe that they have views wider than the borders of their own localities and courage enough to take part in a modern not designed and calculated to advance the interests of Australia at large All the talk about the necessity and practicability of framing a better bill is so much dust thrown in the eyes of the public Appeals to supposed local interests or In local prejudices are but so many inducements to intercolonial isolation Alai mist predictions of disaster if the people accept the 11101 Sure now offered to them have no foundation in fact. Can there be any disaster from 11. union of forces for national protection * Can there be any disaster from the throwing down of the barriers now preventing free commercial intercourse between neighbouring territories These are the two chief objects of federation, and to secure these the labours of the best intellects of Australia have been exerted for the past decade In giving their votes at the on suing referendum, electors may safely brush aside the fallacious arguments and alarming predictions which are being day after day put forth by persons who either desire to perpetuate the isolation of the colonies or are too timid to move out of the beaten track of conservatism Such are the enemies of national progress and of intercolonial prosperity. THE " MAITLAND DAILY MERCURY " The Federal Government of Australia will be a power co raised by the people. It will not be a tyranny capable of imposing its own remorseless will Knell elector, enjoying the heritage of his freedom, has a voice spoke in the Federal and in the States Govern- ment Should he be willing to make the cost of the Federal Government an actual addition to the present cost of governing Australia under six sons rate State Governments he can do so But he is under no compulsion to hear that additional cost. He can so order matters that there shall be no additional cost If it be argued that the Federal Government will be extravagantly outlay and will impose burdensome taxation, it can be repeated that the Federal Government is hugely restrained by the constitution in the expenditure of money is really under a greater restraint to be economical than is any State Government now, and that the danger of extravagant Governmental outlay is present in every Australian community at this moment. The only effective check on Governmental extravagance is the declared will of a frugal and economical people, and such a check the Australian people will, under fe toration, have many inducements to apply for while federation is one development of a disposition to improve the government of Australia another development must eventually be the extension of municipal government, freeing the State Administrations from many functions which trammel them in the discharge of their proper duties The conclusion is that the extra taxation said to he the inevitable outcome of federation is a bogy which the electors of Australia can scatter to the four winds if they will burdensome taxation is not a necessary concomitant of federation any more than it is a necessary concomitant of the present system Self governing peoples, alive to their power of controlling the w eight of the burden they shall bear for their government,liavecommuiul of the situation alike under federation and under integration From day to day, as our readers will have noted, we endeavour to put forward answers to the misrepresentation so shamefully characteristic of the opposition of the bill Every honest well out of the situation will allow that no contention of the other side has not been effectively answered And answered either directly and in accordance with common sense and straightforward interpretation, or on the reasonable assumption of which we may here remind our renders Let it be admitted that under the draft constitution the worst results predicted could hay pen All constitutions are operated by men, and there is no magic in the best constitution in the world to prevent bad men from ruining a nation under its forms But rulers do not in ordinary cases deliberately plan the destruction of a nation Holding with Mr Barton that the best refutation of much destructive criticism is the bill itself we emphasise his exhortation to read it carefully It is rather remarkable how perusal of the assailed provisions, couched as they are in English of the most perspicuous clearness, dissipates the clouds of dis- trust and alarm raised by falsehood and evil speak lag I hereto, we say, read the bill read the whole full-speed lily read the whole of the provisions dealing with any intricate possible situation as for example the sections affecting the posy ers of the Legislature in connection with money bills The reader, thus seeking enlightenment, unless his faculties are hopelessly bedimmed by what he has been told is in the bill, and will not see through his own eyes, will recognise in the draft constitution an instrument to which he may safely commit the fortunes of United Austitdia THE ALBURY " BORDER POST " " It is possible that some harm is done to the cause of union by the tacit assumption that federation is a mildly good thing, without any examination of the grounds of that assumption the reasons in favour of federation are so strong and overwhelming that their examination must have the effect of rousing people from that apathetic condition of an quiescence, which is at present so common the fact is ; but federation is not merely desirable in a general kind of way, but for BOX oral reasons, is imperatively no necessary One of the reasons, which is considerably underrated is the necessity of having some proper scheme of defence for Australia, under one central Government This is not a matter on which we can take a stand by ourselves It is quite useless fortifying our harbours and keeping up an expensive military stables h ment, if even one of the other colonies neglects its defences A proper scheme for Australian defence is necessary, and in case of war prompt and concerted action It would be too late to federate on the outburst of war, we must be prepared to those who scoff at the possibility of w r, and who are living in the present can see nothing beyond, the argument addressed to the pocket must carry weight At present New South Wales alone is freetrade, the other colonies imposing duties of varying degree on all imports It results from this, that the manufacturers and producers of the other colonies, being practically subsidised by their Governments, are able to compete on advantageous terms with those of New South Wales They can send their products into New South Wales free of any duty and meet us in our own markets on equal terms But if we wish to send our products to com- pets in their markets, we are met at the border by protective barriers , we must pay customs duties and stack the The result of this is, that New South Wales cannot compete with the other colonies in their strongholds, and yet cannot hold her own at home If there were no other reason than this, it should be enough to make the producers of New South Wales vote solidly for any form of federation which will bring to an end this unequal state of things Moreton it is certain that the sweeping away of the barriers between the colonies will enormously increase manufacture, and therefore production AnKnglishflrmof manufacturers, for example, can see no reason now for establishing Works in one of the colonies, since they would still have to pay the same duties in sending from one colony to another us in sending from England, must take away the border custom houses and it will be well worth their while It will pay them better to manufacture of in Sydney and send free of duty to the other colonies, than to manufacture in England or America and tend to Australia. It is not too much to say that a very short time after the consummation of union will see the investment of millions of English and American capital in Australia. And who can doubt that New South Wales as the greatest producer, and with its unrivalled harbour facilities and enormous coal supplies will get even more than her share. Those who decline to look lit federations many way a matter of sentiment, who wish to see where the solid practical advantage comes in, should carefully weigh these reasons. The results of federation will be at least a strong system of defence and an enormous intends to production. It would be well worth our while to make very considerable sacrifices to obtain these advantages. TOE " ARMIDALE EXPRESS " The federal fight continue", and the leaders are busily engaged in the completion of the organisation of forces for the struggle which will take place on June 20 next, when federal freedom, colonial union, and intercolonial commercial unity will make an effort, a final one, let us hope, to burst asunder the enthralment of provincialism, the bondage of a deadly character which surrounds home commerce, and Um barriers which at present divide one colony from another, those who are opposed to union, brotherhood, and national progress are engaged in applying mislead- ing statements with a vigour which is certainly deserving of a better cause, and it is necessary for those who are taking a stand on the other side to do all they possibly can in the direction of leading the true facts of the question of federation before the public. The enemies of union teams! insidious, it is necessary for the friends of union to be watchful and ready, No further reminder ought to be necessary than that a vote in the negative of means discord, pro- socialism, irregular legislation, border duties, unprofitable markets, and even now, while the nffirmativoyoto will mean a passport to freedom, prosperity, intercolonial match, and above all a union binding the colonies of Australia into an empire who he will be or a glorious character, and will command the deepest respect of the civilised world NEWCASTLE "MORNING HERALD a Regarding no public question that has yet and in this country has a greater amount of misrepresentation been made than about the one that has to be answered by the electors of New South Wales on the teeth of June The reasons why federalists are in favour of the constitution that has been framed are well known and open to the world Shortly, these may be summed up in the proposition that union between these colonies will conduce to the collective welfare of the people of Australia, to the ability of its Government to act promptly and effectively in all great emergencies, and to the guidance of the people along the paths of peace, economy, and general concord These surely are aims with which every man who desires the we ii of his country ought to v inpathiBC But the tactics of the other side imply that those who seek to bring about Australian unity are men of guile, who have the lowest and merriest ideals, and who are prepared to sacrifice the best interests of their province if such action would have the effect of accomplishing their dark and sinister ends It is a fuirquoBtionwhothcr any price would be too high for the maintenance of national unity, safety and progress, seeing that the greatest countries in the world have more than once not waited to consider the cost of performing their plain and unmistakable duty in the opinion of the antis believe", however, the performance of public duty is entirely a matter of cost, and if the amount required is above a certain figure, the highest considerations must be ordered to the background and asked to le appear at a more convenient season What we contend for is that in great national questions grave mistakes may be made by regarding the present condition of things as the one that is to last for all time 1 everyday experience shows us the danger of jumping at conclusions regarding the natoutinlitiiH of little known territories, for the Cinderella of to-night may be the Princess Beautiful of to-morrow When Britain was forced to let the United States go their own way.

THE MONARO MERCURY" There is still a haze enshrouded the minds of many of those who will on June 20 be called upon to cast their vote upon the great federal question and which is extremely difficult of dispersion HAIR is due to the opposition to Federation itself, and not the bill, and specious arguments are put forward to convince the multitude that the colonies should not unite, and that their lot would be better if they went along as single States The arguments used against federation last year, and those submitted to the public this year, are by no means assimilable Much objection has been taken to that part of the Commonwealth Bill which gives all the States equal representation vVe naturally consider the question from the point of view of the largest State , but it will help us to a just conclusion if we alter the point of view by considering a federation which we should enter, if at all, as part of a Bmijl unit The union to which reference is made is that which is known by the name of Imperial Fedi ration, and this occupied a good deal of public attention some years back It is not as it has the range of practical politics at present, but every one who looks forward to the preservation of the British Empire sees that some method of giving Australia a voice in the councils of the Empire must be adopted sooner or later No Australian statesman would propose that Australia should enter into a federal compact with Great Britain which could be altered by a majority of the two countries taken fogithcr-ho would be justly considered a traitor to his country Reasoning which is valid between ourselves and the old country does not lose its force sun pi) because we are a larger State compared with tasmania It is evidently impossible for the small States to make any further concession , they have yielded the absolute majority at the joint sittings of the Senate and the House of Representatives Mr Reid not only spoke for New South Wales, but for all Australia, when he said that we should decline to be '' a joint in the tail of the Imperial dog" He laid down a principle applicable to every form of federal union THE " KIAMA INDEPENDENT " England is made up of 32 counties, not one of which is mad enough, even in dreams, to contain plate cutting or Ohtracismg its neighbours And what mo colonies, pray, but so many large country in by the United States of America a large number of States work together towards a common end and good Why should not this be the case here in Australia ? From the first agitating of the subject it must be truly said that hindrances have been strewn all the way One by one we are glad to learn that these hindrances are vanishing Able, resolute, and patriotic legislators have not kept on putting their heads together in vain , the vote of democracy has been the reverse of apathetic, the plutocracy, to a greater or a less extent, is likely to make common cause with the people and the adulterate are doomed to be hopelessly outnumbered and confounded The good cause of federation -iv will surely -win before abuse HAS ever been abolished but had some redeeming feature Not one reform has ever been brought to pass but had some thing of imperfection All sweeping measures raise a good deal of dust, which obscures their being con rly ent ICIMHI for a while but the dust subsides if rashness will but brook a reasonable delay . It is not trees still federalists assert that under the constitution provided by the Commonwealth Bill the minority can rule the majority, or even prevent the immunity from li mug its own way The democratic nature of the constitu- I tions thoroughly assured not only by the thoroughly popular basis of both Chambers, but also by the pre pon do range of power given to the national House *' THE COONAMBLE TIMES" We believe that the tactics being used by the opponents of federation will defeat the end aimed at by the users of these tactics The more the question is discussed, and the more light is thrown on it, the stronger and clearer will become the case for Aus to the union One of the great evils in all those colonies 13 centralisation the interests of the producers in most of them being made subservient to the residents in the respective capri his In this colnnj,Victoria, and Queensland we have differential railway rates, at the cost of the residents generally, with the view of attracting business to Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane This is a most iniquitous state of matters The inhabitants of these colonies are in reality one people, living under the same thing, and an interchange of commodities between them should not be clogged by artificial do vices If it suits the people of Riverina better to trade with Melbourne than with 33 duty, let them do so by all means and if Adelaide by the nearer and better market for the residents of Broken Hill!, why should those residents be prevented from doing business where it suited them best ? Why should a stock tax be imposed by Victoria on New South Wales and Queensland stock ? Federation would do away with the injustices here indicated, and the producers in the various colonies, who are after all the creators of the national wealth, would get a free hand, and thus be enabled to improve their own positions and add to the national prosperity Why should the whole of the residents of this colony be taxed, in the shape of differential railway rates, for the especial benefit of Sydney traders 9 and exactly the same argument would apply to the residents of Victoria and Queensland THE " CLARENCE AND RICHMOND EXAMINER The Commonwealth Bill gives more than it takes away Is provides for intercolonial freetrade that alone will be worth considerably more to the fire danger on the Clarence than five times the amount of additional taxation will have to pay, even if the taxation should be of the late of 2s 6d per head, us of ilBely asserted by the anti-federalists and even if manufactured goods should not become cheaper as the result of the establishment of a large number of additional manufactories When there is danger of a glut of maize in Sydney the surplus can be sent to Melbourne or Adelaide free of duty and this will mean that in all the principal markets maize will he at least 3d per bushel higher than it would be if intercolonial duties existed 1 ItreejiencB a bushel is equivalent to 10s an acre or thereabouts, and the farmer who has 20 acres of rams will be benefited by federation to the extent of the in connection with his crop-a most satisfactory return for the increased taxation he will have to pay The argument applies to other agricultural products besides maize The effect described IS not mere guesswork, or an effort of the imagination , it is an inference from the experience of the Canadian farmers, whose circumstances have greatly improved since the establishment of federa- tion in their country And what benefits the producers must necessarily also bought the distributors and wage-earners, for the more money that learned by the producers the more there is to distribute amounting other classes That is one of the axioms of political economy, and it is such an obvious truth that no sensible man ever thinks of challenging it So the conclusion is that the electrons in the northern districts should accept the Commonwealth Bill About such questions as the capital, the control of the rivers that flow into Victoria and South Australia, minority rule, and the powers of the Senate, they need not concern themselves, for it is exceedingly improbable that any of the questions will be here director of inter-State friction As represented by the antis billies, they are simply follow ed jump kills with candles inside, displayed for the purpose of frightening the people, on the supposition that the latter are fools Although the belief in spooks is pretty widespread, yet nobody should be so silly as to allow his nerves lobe shaken by the spooks that have been exhibited by the enemies of federation Several of them are, indeed, very ancient ghosts, for they were made to appear in the orthodox manner during the federation fights both in the United States and Canada The Federation Bill will be carried and the inhabitants of the northern districts should decide that so far us they are convinced it will be carried by a big majority)
