THE DAMPIER COMPANY. From Starlight to Hamlet, the Dane, is a big jump, and last night's performance served to more fully demonstrate the ability and versatility of Mr. Alfred Dampier. Australia has had many Hamlets, but since the days of Walter Montgomery, the palm has been awarded, to Alfred Dampier, whose melancholy Dane is an evenly sustained and finely drawn performance, and just what might be expected from such a scholarly Shakespearian student as the popu- lar actor-manager is reported to be. Miss Rose Dampier, as Ophelia, was seen at her best in the Dirge scene, and on the whole gave an excellent rendering of the part. Miss Katherine Russell, as Queen Gertrude ; F. C. Appleton, as King Claudius ; Mr. E. Hollo- way, as the Ghost ; Mr. Alfred Rolfe, as Laertes ; Mr. Smith, as Horatio; and Geo.Buller, as the grave digger, were all good ; while Mr. Duggan was simply over-weighted as Polonius, and the same may be said of Mr. Elvins as Guildenstein. To-night "The Green Lanes of England" will be staged, when the company will make its last appear ance.
