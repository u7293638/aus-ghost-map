Ca'stiijIiA.— Six* Pehsons KiHED.^-rThe; principal, matter of interest is 'the fact, that a.third attempt' nas Deen maae to assassinate ,i*enerai...vjaBtma, President of ?eru, and to proclaim \ General 'Fir- inin Castilib in ^ his place. Oii the morning of the r23rd'November-'at a quarter before six,- Castilla's private residence iri; the Calle de las Divbrciados was 'surrounded by: a part' of the' 'Battalion de Limaj' under command of Captain Enrique Laraj whowas also, accompanied by a number: of private persons. It appears that Captain Lara- selected this hour foit the attack upon, the hpus^, because at six o'clock the servants issued therefrom to go, to market) ! and he could thus gain admittance without previously .alarmirig the inmates. ;' The troops were |divided' into two companies, one of . which was to' enter thb house from a side; dqbr by the Calle de la Higiiera, while the other, company was to enter by the principal door in the Divorci a_dos.vLieutlM^iguelFranco,whowa§aguardatthe yide door, was immediately shot dead, and the in surrectionists gained admittance to theipjuse and to thebedropmbf: Castilla,.wherethe iPresidentwas asleep, Hd, however, was . aroused in, season by. his ^vife, and springing put pf bed was Saluted, by a 'shot from a reyolyer, which was prevented from taking effect by the ' pistol being knocked from' the' hand of the assassin' as it. ?exploded. Castilla then fled tban upper robmi followed by one or two more shots, but' escaped' to' the^robf, and thence into the street unhurt. In the mean time, the President's guard, which had been taken by surprise, recovered from - their stupor,' arid shots were fired by both sides in the house. Besides Lieutenant Franco, Juan PfJacibs, a soldier of the guard, was killed.; .Manuel Fpr- celledo, aide-deTcamp pf Castilla, received . a ball -; in the arm, which must be amputated close to the shoulder, and from the effects of. which it: is; feared he will die. 'Whifa tlie attack ?mhs PoiTur on, ColprielArguedas, the. same who eiitered the Legislative Palace three years ago and broke the Congress at the point of the bayonet, arid who lives direotly opposite the'house of Castilla, came out on his balcony to see what the trouble was. Addressing i the soldiers, he inquired : '^ What did you conie here for ?': - ?' We don't know ; we only know . that ;pur ; . . offiLcers ; told us we must shoot general Castilla.'; ; 'Well, now snoot your omcers, saia jixgueaas, and the order was obeyed-— Captain.. Manuel Alarco, Lieutenant Jabinta Mayorga, arid- a ci tizien, Don Joke Maria deAparicib, son )bf the old General Aparicio, were shot dead by the soldiers, and Sergeant J. M.Quispe was severely wounded. This ended ,the rpw, Lara escaping from the troops and police, which by this tiirie had come up. I should have stated inthe proper place that Lieutenant Mariano Amorin was shot dead by *a soldier of his own, and who relented at the part he was taking in the bedroom of the : President, and it was this incident that saved the President's, life. It issaid that; there is a society existing:at, Lima, under the name of the Union and'Proeress. composed of I sworn enemies of Castilla, andat.the. head of whi^h is DbW Pedro Galvez, late Secre-1 jtary pi* War and member of the Congress, that was ^ex^ejled by Castilla through Arguedasi ' and ^fl^er^q^ directions, it is supposed, .''fall three '?^e ^feap^s ^tn jthe attacks on the iPresident have oiJ.
