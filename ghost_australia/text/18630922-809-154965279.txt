LAND FOR THE VOLUNTEERS. TO TIIE EDITOR OF THE AGE. Sir, — A wise' Government prepares in peace Wm for its security in timo of war, and now that W& tho peaco of Europe seems trembling in the ' ' ml lialaucc, it behoves our colonial Governments g£| to look to their own defences, and especially |||i this colony of Victoria, which is known fill throughout ths world as being, next India, mm the richest dependency of tho British Crown. . |§ra Thero aro but two ways open to us by which. mm wo can feel securo ayainst attack ; one is the WM maintaining a large and efficient militia, the grai other, is tho placing our volunteer system on a i||| more sure and nermanent basis. Now. Sir. I Ik1| think somo such plan as the following, based WM on the volunteer system, would succeed well : — WJM Of the ten fiiillion nsres agricultural areas, I filfi would reserve ono million acres to be granted j|||i to a body of military settlers ; each, man ||i| to hold one hundred acres,, conditionally ||| of his serving the State in any mill- ^jj tary capaoity ; whon called upon such elm service to- be always within the colony; h!| and tho land thus grunted could be so situated Wm in blocks, say of ten thousauel acres, along tho ? §|| several lines of railway, nnd contiguous to tho ||| various towns along our seaboard, so that tho Wsb men could be massed in large bodies at any gS given point on short notico. Each iilock would jig contain a company of one hundred men, electing |i| its own officers, subject to- tho approval of the ||| Government, aud should he kept in an efficient fm state of drill and organisation. On the death ||| of any of tho settlers, his family o-v heir should |j| maintain an efficient man always at the service ||| of tho State. By some such plan as the above tgi the colony would always possess a- permanent ra and well-organised force often thousand men, || holding a considerable stake in the country, 11 and therefore the more to lie relied on in the Eg hour of danger. Trusting that tho importance || of the subject of our defence against invasion H will be my excuse for taking up so much of your h valuable space,, believe mo. Sir, your obedient S servant, ALERT. 1 Melbourne,. 21st September, 1803. i A GneisT w a Boat. — We weiro, on Saturday h»i\\. ? invited to iuspeet about as curious a specimen, of; B naval architecture as \to have over seen.
