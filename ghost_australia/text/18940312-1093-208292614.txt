CRICKET. SATURDAY'S MATCHES. SOME TALL SCORING. FOUR CENTURIES RECORDED. [By "Onlooker."] 1'he attendance on the Adelaide Uval on Saturday afternoon was again large, and the public were treated to Eome good batting and one close finish. The result of the match between the Australs and Norwoods was most astonishing. The Eastern team crept up to within 21 runs of the Australs' score for the loss of five wickets, and then the " tail" went down for 7 runs. The partnership of Gooden and Green was an admirable" one, each batsman reaching the century. They Dut on 206 runs for the fourth wicket, while Blinman, Gooden, and Green piled on 342 runs between them. The South Adelaides covered 'the Adelaides' score of 176 with the loss of three wickets, Dyer making 74 not out. The Adelaides commenced a match with the Ports, and, batting first, put together 263 for four wickets, Scrymgour being not out with 151 to his credit-when stumps were drawn. At Ken sington the Hiudmarsh beat the Norths by 14S runs. The Norwoods had a big contract when they Btarted the task of wiping olf the score of 423 set them by the Australs, but at the end of the first day of play they had put together 154 runs for two wickets. When play was con tinued on Saturday Blinman wa3 7S and Gooden 47. Very little alteration had been made to the score, however, when Blinman was clean bowled by Pord. It was a rattling good ball and took the little Norwood man somewhat by surprise, as he was by no means foroing the game. The total wa3 at 157 when Blinman got out, and Green was the next man to go in. The colt started off quietly, while the veteran Gooden waited for his opportu nities. The scoring was very slow for some time, but when Green began to feel his ground a little he opened out on the bowl ing. He gave a chance at 6, and the let off appeared to put new life into him. The South Adelaides caught the Norwoods' score a few minutes later, and although Gooden and Green were not making many runs at the time the changes in the bowling were rung in at short intervals. Then they settled down to good steady cricket, and the total was carried over the second century. The scoring at this stage was much faster. Gooden's off play was very effective, while his strokes were clean and well timed. After he got into the eighties he steadied down again and Green took up the running. He played nice. free cricket, and very soon placed the half-century opposite his name. His hitting all round the wicket was Eound, his off play in particular being very pretty, and he was sure on the leg side. At a quarter to 5 o'clock Gooden topped the century amid loud applause, and a few minutes later the total was increased to 300. The chances of the Australs now appeared to be remote, as both batsmen were playing excellent cricket. When hp was 72 Green gave E. Leak a difficult chance at leg, which he failed to negotiate. Once more he steadied down a little, and at 20 minutes past 5 he cleared the century, receiving quite an ovation. Travers was then bowling at the southern end, and the next ball Green received he lifted over the chains for 5. It would have gone out of the oval but for the trees. Then he got 2 fours off E. Leak's next over, and 350 was placarded on the indicator. When he was ll7 Green was caught off Travers and well deserved the applause which greeted- him aB he retired. His innings was an excellent • piece of batting despite the ohanees given. Hayward joined Gooden and opened very cautiously, the score then standing at 363. Both batsmen forced the play a little so as to finish the game, before the call of time, and 400 was quickly posted. It was then ten minutes to the call of time and 24 runs were wanted. Gooden and Hayward were running for almost everything, and owing to this Good en was run out when he had put together 137. The old veteran met with a big reception as he left the field. His only chance was at 127, when he gave Travers a warm one at leg. Eive wickets for 402 looked good enough for anything, and when the time for drawing stumps had arrived Blinman decided to let his team continue, as the light was good enough. _ On the arrival :of Woods Hayward- skied a ball from Travers to long on, and Maekie tried to make a difficult running oatcb. He did not get hold of the ball fairly, however, and split one of his fingers so badly that, he had to retire. The following ball Hayward drove hard back to Travers, who failed to secure it, but Woods getting strike to the lefthander was clean bowled. Six for 405. Liston was the next man in, and it was generally expected that he and Hayward would pull off the match. When the latter was caught off Hack without any addition to the total the Norwood supporters looked un comfortable, as they were batting one man short, and Geering and O'Brien were the only remaining meD. Liston drove Travers to the chains and inoreased the total to 409, but the next ball nipped his bails off. O'Brien joined Geering, and Travers's succeeding ball beat him all the way, thus leaving the Australs victors with 14 runs to the good. The win was a very credit able one for the young team, and they deserve praise for the manner in which they worked to avert defeat. The Norwoods have a bad tail, as the last four wickets only put on 7 runs. The South Adelaides had lost two wickets for 104 when play was "stopped on Saturday week, and they wanted to make 177 to win. Martin was 47 not out and Dyer 32 not out when the innings was resumed, and the score had only been raised to 124 when Martin was clean bowled by Delaney. Brunton joined Dyer, who was batting well, and the required number was made without, further loss, the hitter tjeing 74 not out and Brunton 24 not out. Dyer played nice orioket throughout his innings. He used his willow • with great freedom, while his strokes were well timed. He has proved'one of the most consistent bats in the association this season, and his average will read well. After they had finished their match with the South Adelaides the Adelaides commenced their fixture with the Ports. They had the first use of the wicket, which was an excellent one, but the innings of the red-and-blacks opened very inauspiciously. Two wickets were down for 3 runs, both Magarey and His cock being stumped by Howell, who took Gowling's fast deliveries very creditably. Scrymgour ought j,$o have been caught and bowled by Everett before he scored, and I presume he regretted afterwards that he did not accept the chance, seeing that Scrym gour made 151 not out without "the ghost of a possible." Haldane put together 36 by very ..nice cricket, and then he was smartly caught by Everett in the slips. It, wes e one-hand catch, and was neatly taken. Pergusson, who has had three not-outs this season, went in earlier than usual, and made 24 by good batting, but he was alow compared with Scrymgour, who was hitting fours all round the wicket. It was during this partnership that he reached his century, at which stage he was playing charming cricket. His cuts and drives were excellent, and he was deadly on the leg side. Hone got a start once more, and rattled up his 45 not out in good time. _ He treated all the Port trundlers alike, and his off play generally was admirable. He gets a wonderful amount of wood behind his drives, and his form all round on Saturday showed great improvement. Scrymgour looked good for another century when stumps were drawn, and the public were greatly pleased to see him display his true form after his performance with the willow in the inter j colonial matoh. His score on Saturday in S i i.o®18 a.nd 1 five. Pour wickets for tvt 8 an impossibility lor the Ports. _ Now that the intercolonial contests are over it. seems as though playera and spectators alike have lost most of their interest in cricket for the season. Many of the former go about their work m a half-hearted fashion, while the latter are chiefly conspicuous by their absence. At all events this was the case on the Kensington Oval on Saturday afternoon when the North Adelaides and Hindmarsh concluded the match commenced a few weeks ago. Besides the players one could almost count the visitors on one's two hands, and no great treat was lost by those who decided not to turn up. The Hind marsh _ were without the services of M. Jarvis, whose place behind the sticks was taken by R. Evans. The latter at times showed good capabilities for the position, and he ran out two men smartly, but he missed a chance from Peter Hill which should have been taken. ^ The North Adelaides, who had lost three wickets for 53 runs, had to face a score of 341, and "Wilkinson and Claxton, with 18 and 4 runs respectively, opened up against the bo wliDg of P. Jar vis and Tonkin, lhe scormg for the first half hour was fear fully slow, neither of the batsmen getting any wood into their strokes. Claxton, who, as a rule, keeps things moving, wa3 the ohiet offender in this respect, as while he scored 13 Wilkinson totted up 29. Claxton was run out for 17 in a very foolish way, as a start was made for the run when the ball had almost reached Edwards's hands. He should, however, have been run out at an earlier stage than this. Wilkinson warmed up to his work afterwards, and played a oapital innings for 74 without making a mistake. He treated every ball with confidence, and scored 8 fours and a five. Of the rest A. Hill was the only bats man who worried the bowlers much, his 31 runs being put up in his usual attractive style, ine other double-figure scorers were Pettinger 10 (not out), and Peter Hill 10. P. Jarvis bowled very well. He was not taken off the whole afternoon, and captured five wickets for ' Jack Noel's average was two for 42. Although on Priday afternoon the Whin hamites beat Way College without the loss of a wicket, the students of the younger school desired that the match might be continued. When they arrived on the grouud on Saturday morning, as arranged, they expressed a wish that the match might be played out with two inningq aside. yhere j?ould neve? =have been 2S2 8 134 ■ 4 174 9 87 2 72 2 2S 0 84 2 47 0 108 2 60 1 12 0 11 0 24 1 10 0 12. 0 ' 7 0 12 0 12 0 time for this, however, and then Hecklle (75) and Pullin (7) continued their innings, to give the Way. bowlers an opportunity of making amends. But the result was rather different to what the South Adelaide School expected, as at noon, when stumps were, drawn, the batsmen were still at the orease3, arid only one wicket had fallen for 2S7, Heddle being not out 129, and Pullin not ont 48. _ The stand made by Bird, Heddle, and Pallin is one of which Whinham College may iustly feel proud, as not . only are the figures tall but t he runs were made by excellent cricket. HediUe gave a possible chance at leg on Saturday m orning, while Pullin was let off in the slips, but these were the only mistakes made by the three batsmen. The Way scholars fielded welL NORWOOD Y.
