JOTTINGS ABOUT THE HUON. ] ( / from the Australasian, April 7 ) xviii. Europe, Asia, Africa, and America were either under the sea, or just slowly making their way out of Australia, if we are to believe the geologists, was already an established institution, and the newest or cents is inhabiting the oldest of lands Hence it is that nature with us is BO odd-that the trees look like widows bewitched, that the opossums and kangaroos earthen children in natural watch pockets long after. animals turn their adrift, that cherries glow with stones outward, me! that all the physical world, of a word, is turned topsy turn) Certainly there is nothing to Milking toast angel knocking about the A, strains as the contrast between the glare and ran one, of the newly arrived two looted denizens "of the soil, and the imperturbable massive cross, strangeness, and gloom of a real Australian wide areas The only expression of the sensation of the effects the latter that we can give, that it impresses us like the By ran ills, mm eying just the same oppress the sense of perpetuity, of something without a hearing, and that is never to have an end We can perfectly believe the Lure trees to have existed before the flood They look as if they had been born in the time of the pre Adamite coats They live in their own solemn existentes, and have little Other life among the" A ] European forest, however dense is always full of life The tall oaks, beeches, and firs shelter under their green boughs a carpet of wild flowers, and are musical with the chirping and Marbling of the happy birds, sitting at will from spray to spray Here and there open vistas of hills and patches of turf, upon which we could readily fancy Oberon and Titania disporting themselves in the English moonlit nights We should certainly not fancy Oberon and return taking their voluntary amusement in any Australian forest of our acemnmtnncc (and we have known very many), the ugh MC could i caddy believe in the presence of any number of phantoms and ghosts This of course, is not true of nil The sassafras is a cheerful tree the mimosa in blossom is a beauty y'are these predominate the gloom 18 <l"Pe,,lcd 2 're the colonist has settled down, and the axe has done its work, the brightness of the young plantations sets off even the dark lining of the surround- me lush Nor does the normal nature of the wilderness predominate everywhere Nothing, for instance, can be brighter than much of the exquisite scenery of Queensland, than that wonderfully beautiful region of New South W ales, Illawarra which is simply the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight amplified in length and breadth ns lovely, but for mere . grandiose Nothing can be brighter than the course of the Derwent, or finer than the Gipps Land ranges, or prettier than some bits of the Yarra, or more seemingly picturesque than Port Jackson, or how many more shall we quote 5 Still there are regions and regions in Australia which are very grand, perhaps, but haunt the imagination with the idea of something abnormal and unnatural-such as we can see in no other quarter of the globe They appear to be always in mourning They are utterly lifeless, and life is life, an unanswerable proposition They are to be found in many parts, but generally we must go far south for them, The dampen the climate grows, the denser the vegetation, the higher the trees, the more entangled the creepers , till we get to a region where twilight reigns at midday , where animal life becomes almost extinct, and nothing but the rush of a torrent and the mournful sighing of the imprisoned breeZe breaks on the otherwise unbroken silence Such is the western half of Tasmania, or No-man's land, which, from the creation to the present time, has kept its dark secrets impenetrable to itself, and the interest of the Huon is that it lets us drift comfortably into some of the secrets of Nature s prison house It is something to be able to go into a jolly good steamer, to a jolly good hotel, to he fed up at cost prices on fish, fowl, cutlets, and civility gratis, and to know that, it we please, we can leave our bones man impenetrable i w clearness a dozen miles off, simply because, if we were fools enough to get into the wilderness without a guide, we should never get out of it alive Per Cul- I laden steamer we can do or risk all this, and as a new sensation is worth anything in this blase world, we will jot down some of the remembrances of a week or two on the Huon AS We are on the Huon, but though the noble stream has its head somewhere or other [where nobody exactly knows in what we have dubbed "No man is land, there is certainly not much of the wilderness about Franklin, nor much of the wild about host Chesterman and his pleasant wife, in the comfortable inn where we are sitting, boots off, cigar in mouth, and feeling perfectly Jolly [N B -The above solemn commencement was written before dinner, and the sequel after it, which makes all the difference ] the very pleasant day, as we write, has just come to a pleasant end, which makes us feel amiable, and inclined to look upon Irnnkhu as a smoking Liverpool, the Huon is an undeveloped AS year Moselle, and ever the villainous countenance of our boatman is somewhat superior to that of a chimpanzee for richad been obliged to have a boatman, the Culloden, like the A Victorian Government, having stink in the mud, though, unlike the sue!
