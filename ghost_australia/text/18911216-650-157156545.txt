DIVORCED. Justice lias divorced the two halves of the manual labor party for ever, and now the protectionist lialE is determined to throw in its lot with the Government. The patriotic half called a meeting and refused admission to the broken Reid's half. There is no need to say to the few sound labor members, as Hamlet did to his motherâ€”' 0, throw away the worser part and live the purer with the other half.' They have done it. The decayed side of the pear has been sliced away and thrown into tho Opposition sty, and there may the grunting population of the pen wax fat on their prize. The Government have the majority, and so can afford to despise the Reid that bends . in the swamp, the physical Want that betrays a political mental vacancy, the Bruce who is now as impotent as a better man of that name was once powerful, the Farnell who occasionally shows a sjririt the reverse of commendable, and the rest of the awkward squad whose most powerful man is a traitor, a renagade, Kiama ghost resurrectionist, sectarian cry raiser, and charlatan generally.
