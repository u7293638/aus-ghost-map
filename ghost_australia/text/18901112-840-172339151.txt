The Constitutional Bogey. From time immemorial it has boon the fashion with nursegirls, foster- mothers, end old dame instructresses to'awe .bairns into submission by threats of calling up baro-bono bogies. Tho foster parent of tho finanoial policy of tho Gov ernment is just now trying her hardest to terrify tho ' ' old boys " of tho Gounoil with tho constitu tional bogey. Thoolddamoiaviolontlyoxeroised, not to say oxasporated, beoauBe the "stupid" old follows aro so " blind " as not to sos tho force oi the threat. Well, like tho shepherd's ory of wolf, this bogey cry baa boen made so olten that it haB lost its offeot. Auy way, if rawbonos be aa ghostly as he is dopioted, that is no reason why tho old boys should rofrain, in terror of conssquonoes, from going on with their duty. As was remarked yesterday, if tho bogey forbids amendment of tho bill it does not prohibit debate. Surely the members may express their honest views without offensive aspersions being oust by the old damo on thoir motives. Ia there less sincerity in the Connoil than at tho White Corner? Is all the pure patriotism of tho legislature oonoentrated in tho lower Chamber ? Should not some littls oredlt for integrity of motive be given to gentlemen who aro entrusted with an important public funotion? Ib the education or experisnoe of tho dotraotora of those gentlemen so defcotivo, or so vitiated, _ that it cannot mako allowances for sinoerity and honesty in peoplo whomay be open, by thoir private oiroumstauoep, to the surpfniou of putting selfish or olasa interests before patriotism? Is it to bo assumed that because a nursing mother ie blindly devoted to her foster-ohild that every body else is stupidly blind to the blemishes of that swaddled infant ? Are tbe observers of those blemishos to bo awed to silence by threats of a ghost? "
