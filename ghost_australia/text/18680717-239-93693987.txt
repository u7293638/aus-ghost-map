INCREASING AND MULTIPLYING WITH A VENGEANcE !-In the year 1809 the Vienna newspapers contained the following announce ment:-" Maria Anna Helen, the wife of a poor linen weaver in Neulerchenfeld, twenty years married, bore at eleven confinements thirty-two children, twenty-eight fiving and four dead; twenty- six were males and six females; all were by one father, and mursed by herself. She had at her last "confinemenlt three children, one living and two dead. Her husbadd was a twin, she herself one of four. Her mother had produced thi.ty- eight chil dren, and died during a confinement with twins. The greatest number of children ever produced at one birth appears to have been six, all of whom were boys. and all dead; and the woman who gave birth to them had been twice married, and had already given birth to forty-four children. During her first marriage, which lasted twenty-two years, she bore twenty-seven boys and three girls. In her second marriage, which lasted but thnee years, she bore fourteen children-tlree at the first, five at the second,' and six at the third confinement. A W?ELsH GHosT -Abernant, near Aber dare, is at present in the enjoyment of a ghost, locally certified as the spirit of the deceased wife of a workman, who had threatened her husband before death that she would haunt him if he ill- treated her children, and who seems to have had reason for keep ing hor word. The spiritual influence is chiefly manifested by jugs, chairs, and tables jumping about in the house; but the ex parish constable, who was sent for to lay the ghost, was made the subject of a different manifestation. In reply to a solemn request, he received a blow with a stone, and was laid himself, instead of laying the ghost. The police were sent for, and they tied the deceased's daughter's hands, thinking she was at the bottom of the affair, but the latest accounts say the ghost continues its manifesta tions.

WHEN her Majesty leaves Windsol the establishment is "put on board wages." We may also mention that when her Majesty is at the Castle she has to pay out of the privy pnrse not only for every buck which she takes from the park for venison, but also for every pheasant, hare, or partridge, and that she has even to buy the eggs and butter for the house hold from her own farm, so rigidly is every expense accounted for between the different departments.

SILENT LoE.--There is a very pretty story told of a man who in his youth, secretly loved a girl' of his native town. He was too bashful to reveal it; or rather, believing that his love was hopeless, he kept it to himself, and lived ii long and weary life, with the love of that woman as green in his heart as in the days of his boyhood. When he had growh grey, and was wealthy and honoured, he met the object of his affections. She was a mation then-a widow ivithl grown up and married daughters; anid it happened one day, after a dinner to which she ihad invited him, that the subject of their early life came up between them, and careless remark opened the eyes of the lady to the fact that she had--been secretly admired by the man beside her. Ten minutes' talk informed him to his great aston ishment,.. that unknown .to him, .be had- also been beloved, and that the ?ady had waited long and painfully for his declaration, and had only accepted another offer reluctantly, and because of the importunities of friends. When the daughters came' into the parlour, they were surprised to find their mother and the grey-haired bachelor sitting together, with clasped hands, and mutually expressive eyes; and in a short time this twain were made one and the gentleman had only himself to blaime that he had waited twenty-five years for his wife. And the morel of this story is addressed to all bashful swains, in the language of the old proverb, "Faint heart never won fair lady," During the war of the rebellion it is known that a strong secessionist spirit was prevalent in Baltimore, in which many of the news? boys sympathized. One of these small itinerant pedlars, .with a bundle of news papers under his arm, entered a car at the Baltimore and Ohio depot in that city, a few minutes before the train started for Washing= ton, and while passing through shouted,.
