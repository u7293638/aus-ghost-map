LITERATURE. j Almost on the very day when the death of Mfai Adah Isaacs Menken was announced in the London papew, appeweda vol»xme of poem s attributed loth at Iftdy. sent forth with a certain degree ofmystery, without publisher's Quae or imprint,, in a black cover of extra ttournfulness. Humours of this coifiing b6on tp tbe poetical world had for some months previously pervaded society. Piquant stones werie afloat respecting the fair Adah's con nexion with at least one of our living Eng lish poets; and it was publicly stated, and not cetotradicted, that the volume would be dedicated to Mr. Charles Dickens, and wopld appear under his sanction and patronage. A work so heralded could not butprovokeagood deal of curiosity. Miss Adah Isaacs Menken in the flesh (and she was ever very much in the flesh) was a person of some distinction in her circle-by which we do not mean only the circus. She had become famous by her achievements on bare-backed steeds of the desert, matching in her own person the backs of those intelligent animals. She had, in these exercises, appeared to solve the problem which is presently occupying so many of her sex, by showing us how little clothing might serve for adornment. In fact, she had almost suc ceeded in bringing us again to the age of tnnooeuce. She had apparently declared war against raiment, and was bent on bringing us back to as near the fig-leaf as the metropoli tan police and degenerate public opitiion would permit In her time she had played many parts, but was most at home in Boenes of the circle. As Mazeppa she had an oppor tunity of wearing nothing to speak of but her back hair and ropes, and it was in this cha racter'that she won her greatest triumphs. Whatever might be said of the spirit which she threw into her performances, no one could doubt that they were full of foody, and of her genius it might be said that it was strictly corporeal. To hear of such a woman that she had written a volume of poetry, was as startling as though one had been told that a working bullock had burst into lyrics. It was held to be a piece of waggery at the expense of the corpulent A. Menken-an extrava gance from the mint of Alexandre Dumas, or a carnal invention of Mr. Algernon Swin burne's. Yet it is true that Adah Isaacs Menken has written poems, and it is clear, from all internal evidence, that they are veritably her own production, and that she has not been helped to them by any of her. literary admirers. The marvel of all is, that the poems are, i$ their kind, very respectable ones-that they have nothing of the character which we might have supposed would belong to them-that they are true and real outbursts from a woman's heart. There is not a word in them which could offend the chastest ^ar, nor Is there any hint of the undraped quality which was the favourite attribute of' the authoress. Whatever her body might have been in life, the soul of Menken is decently .clothed, and her imagination, if wild and un regulated, is perfectly sex-like and proper. In this respect'she may compare favourably with the two poets' from whom she has borrowed tbe most, and whom she most resembles-Algernon Swinburne and Walt Whitman. There is the same luxury of asimalism as in this fdrm'er, #n'ii f.hft «^mft ;| fiercelust of nature as in the latter, imt com-: pared to either Adah Menken is modfcst, self restrained, and proper. The heroine of the ring shows, indeed, as might be expected from her training, much muscularity, and a good deal of eaw-dust She rails as bitterly > against the conventional as either of her .'two nitj⪕, but therei^a certain pathetic aide to , her.genius to which hoth \Yalt Whitman and Swinburne are strangers. The key-note of the whole volume is, in fact, an intense melancholy. Considering what the woman was, and what was her life-the daughter of a Spanish Jew adventurer by a .French courtezan-a public dancer at the age of fourteen, and a trafficker in her charms from that time to her death, there is something very touching, as well as curious, in such lines as these, headed "Infelix".

I can wait." That there is a certain power of passion, and a gift of titaostpoetry ih these lines, can hardly be denied. They would be remark able had any one written them. They are peculiarly remarkable £8 coming from such as Adah Menken; We cannot dismiss these poems'with only a sneer or a laugh ; and | elaborately to satirize them, as theScdurday [Review does, is the most offensive sort of vulgar puppyism. To speak of Miss' Menken 'asa "passionate Tapper*'is neitherjiupiour ous nor true. Society may hare quarrelled with the person of Adah Menken alive, bat to carry this grudge to her spirit beyond the grave seems the very extreme of petty snob bishness. Whatever the woman is, she is not like Tnpper, bat avery real and earnest kind ;of genius. We tnfcy 'wonder if we will, but we cannot ridicule such lines as these: " The red mouth cloeed down the breath that was hard 1 and fierce. . , The mad pulse beat back the baffled life with .a low sob. ^ Add BO the stark and naked sefel unfolded Its wings to the dimness of death 1 I .A lonely, unknown death. ., "A death that left this dumb, living body as his endless ' mark.
