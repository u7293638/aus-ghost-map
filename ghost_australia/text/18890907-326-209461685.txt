AN IRATE POET. Never, since the days of Pope and Dennis, has anything quite so savage appeared in. literature as Mr. Robert Browning's little ode, "To Edward Fitzgerald," published in the last Atlmmum. Mr. Aldis Wright, in his "Life and Letters" of tlie translator of Omac Khayyam, had most incautiously admitted a hasty sentence of the genial ritz, which, ran: — "Mrs. Browning's death is rather a relief to me, I must say: no more Aurora.. Leighs, thank God ! A woman of real genius, I know ; hut what is the upshot of it all! She and tier sex had better mind the kitchen and the children; audi perhaps the poor. Except in such things a3 little novels, they only devote themselves to what men do much better, leaving that which men do worse or not at all." Mr. Browning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passage— never, of course, meant for toe public eye— and blazed, forth into the subjoined volcanic verses : — To Edwakd Fitzgerald. ' I chanced upon a now book yesterday ; I opened it, and, where my finger lay , "IVixt page and uncut page, these words I read- Some six or seven at most— and learned thereby That you, Fitzgerald, whom by car and eye She never knew, " thank God my wife was dead. : Ay, dead ! and were yourself alive, good Fitz, Row to return you thanks would task my wits. Kicking you seems the common lot of curs — While more appropriate gr eeting lends you grace, Surely to spit there glorifies your face — Spitting from lips once sanctified by hers.

Should a great poet thus, for a fretful phrase, avenge toe dead upon the dead, by telling him who was the "best friend" of Lord Tennyson, and author, in the way of translation, of the " one_ thing done divinely well,'' that his ghost is not good enough to spit at ? Mr. Aldis "Wright has cer tainly much to answer for.
