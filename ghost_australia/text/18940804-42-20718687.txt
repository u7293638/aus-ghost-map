Literary Chitchat. A Society of Women Journalists has been formed in London for mutual encouragement and support. It is stated in the history of Punch, which is appearing in The Sybarite, that Leech's first contribution actually decreased its circulation. The drawings were at that time oopied on to one blook, and only one engraver could be ai work at a time. Leech's first drawing, aB it was for a full page, could not be got ready in time. It was only when some one hit upon the idea of dividing the block into four, and baying four engravers at work, that Leech's drawings had a fair chance. The veteran composer and vocalist, Henry Russell, whose " Cheer, Boys, Cheer" and " A Life on the Ocean Wave" sent many a shipload of the best class of emigrants to California and Australia in the old days and heartened them on their way, is about to publish a volume of reminiscences of the past seventy years. The book is to appear at the same time in London and New York. Mrs. Humphry Ward has recently been far from well, and has been ordered " complete rest" for some time to come.

A gathering of the Society of Authors, including women, has also its raison d'etre; but a gathering of women writers as such does not attraot me. Sex asserts itself, of course, in literature as it does everywhere else, but there, at any rate, I do not want to emphasise it." Among the new books shortly to appear is "The Quaker Poets of England," by Evelyn Pyne (Mrs. Evelyn Noble Armitage), author of " A Dream of the Gironde" and other works. This volume will include biographioil and critioal notices of Quaker poets from the earliest days of the Society of Friends, with selections from their poetry, and will be pre- faced by an essay on the characteristics of Quaker poetry. It appears that Cardinal Moran's book on the Roman Catholic Ohuroh in Anglo-Saxon countries is to be ready in a Bhorttirae. During his life the Cardinal Archbishop of Sydney (remarks the London Dai'y Chronicle) has done a good deal of literary work. Most of it has had reference to the Roman Catholio Church in his own native country, Ireland. He edited Cardinal Cnllen's pastoral letters and other writings in three volumes^J9£rflnrh%~M(itforth a collection of letters anrf»e^ifl&{t^anfeh^>f the history of the i!rlm^Ch^'rcn v'i«j^iH* Reformation to the jmntfWfKl^ His otherwft^ literary undertaking! > ja« ifi e<tifc ▲rchdarfa^ " Monastioon Hibernm&X;* )  Mrs. Harriet BeeoheMupw^was in too "feeble"' health to be present at (H^me^it-anxeilMiKtt^ Hartford, Connecticut, whelhSkJtajbjj^ftittstf)tr marble portrait bast of herself7"'Mmi Whitney was the so alp tor, and the bust, which cost £200, and was paid for by the subscriptions of Con necticut women, was unveiled by Hilda Stowe, Mrs. Stowe's granddaughter. Harper's Bnaar mentions that Julian Haw thorne, the American novelist, has a taste for tropical life, and has recently purchased a large farm in the mountains of Jamaica, where he purposes raising fruit and early vegetables for the Northern markets. He has also rented a roost beautiful residence, Mona, on a coflee estate near Kingston. The place is supposed to be haunted, but, to the present owner's disgust, the ghost refuses to appear. "He knows I should interview him, and use him as material," says Mr. Hawthorne. At the reoent marriage of Misß Violet Maxse to Lord Salisbury's fourth son the cynosure of all eyes in the church (says the Literary World) was the slight figure of an old gentle man who was in such delicate health that he required an arm to help him up the aißle— George Meredith. George Meredith looks his part. Genius and distinction are written on his beautiful, intellectual head, in his almost inspired expression. A man of medium height, he has a thin, delicate figure; a large, noble head, crowned with luxuriant white hair; a short, crisp, well-shaped white beard, peaking out like Lord Spencer's ; soft, blue-gray eyes; and a slightly retroussf. nose. Though a Home Buler and a Democrat, his manner and voice are decidedly aristocratic. His is exaotly the personality one would have chosen for the writer of such masterpieces as "Richard Feverel" and " Diana of the Crossways." Miss Shaw of the Tinet, by- the-way, ia ft graat friend of Mr. Meredith's, and one of the warmest admirers of his works. Tbe " J. A. Owen " whose nameiß familiar as the editor of the books asoribed to " A Son of the Marshes," and who is writing with Pro fessor Boulger, " The Country Month by Month," is Mrs. Harman Visger. Mrs. Visger does the birds, and Professor Boulger tbe botany and insects. Professor Boulger was to leave with the Jaokson-Harrasworth expedi tion for the North Pole in July, but he him self purposed going only as far as Arohangel. The Professor has the distinction of being the husband of that charming writer, "Theo. Gift." The estate of the late R. M. Ballantyne, for thirty years a successful writer of books for boys, was of the net value of £1385. Mrs. Humphry Ward is said to have realised by her two novels, "Robert Elsroere" and 41 David Grieve," no less a sum than £40,000. Dr. Conan Doyle's new story is entitled " The Stark Munro Letters, as written by J. Stark Munro to his friend and former fellow- student, Herbert Swanborougb, of Lowell, Massachu setts, during the years 1881-84." It will appear first in the pageß of " The Idler," commencing with the August number. The " Athenaeum" says Mr. Stevenson has finished another novel, to be called " St. Ivds," which relates to the adventures of a French naval officer who was taken by one of King George's warships during the great French war, and was interned in a Scotch prison. It is not Mr. Stevenson's present intention, so the " Athenaaum" understands, to publish this book for some months. Annie S. Swan at the Women-winters' Dinner. The following is the speech made by Mrs. Burnett Smith (Annie S. Swan) at the dinner of women writers on Friday evening, Ist June :— It is an ordeal of no ordinary kind to make even a five minutes' speeoh before an audience so distinguinhed, and Bhall I say so oritical, as this, but when I look round the tables your faces are kind, and I take oourage to go on. It is a matter of sincere congratulation and joy to all who have the highest welfare of women at heart to think that so many women have achieved such brilliant successes in the field of literature, not afraid of its hard work and its many discouragements, which are not over even when success is attained, since a reputation is as difficult to sustain as it is to make. My own apprentice ship waa long and weary; and I have in my desk a memento of these hard times—the remains of an MS. which was returned to me fourteen times. But while the hardships of authorship are many,' its compensations are rich and rare. These will at once suggest themselves to you, so that I need not occupy time enumerating them here. I belong perhaps to the older sohool; to me the old faiths are still sacred and dear, and I believe the religion of the Nazarene to be the crown of all honest labour, the accentuater of all life's joys, the only thing which can raise (earth's many and bitter sorrows to any tolerable ground. These being my views, it will not surprise you that I regard our responsibility in a very solemn light. Some in high places hold that the function of the novelist is merely to amuse, and that to use his pen for any other purpose is to depart from the primary canons of his art. But surely we aim at something higher than tbnt. There has arisen of late years, what has been called the neurotic school of notion, which lays bare with the relentless , ness of the dissector's knife the baser side of human life, the baser passions of the human soul. These books, too many of which are written by women, cannot do any good, they may do incalculable harm; and I repeat that we to whom the gift is given, women with the best interests of our sex at heart, should feel our responsibility to write what shall elevate and not lower our womanhood. Perhaps lam too serious for an after-dinner speech, but I feel this matter strongly, it is one which has long lain close to my heart. I plead, then, for a higher ideal, an ideal which shall seek to touch the heavens. Let us not grovel when it is still possible to soar. The law of compensation by employers to the surviving families of workmen killed in theiremploy is about to encounter a new form of resistance in France. One-fifth of the deceased workmen's wages would, in case of five orphans, make the employer liable for the whole sum earned, and would have to be paid until each child waa 1G years old. With the prospect of such legislation it is said masters will de oline to employ workmen with families. The French doctors contend that this course, if adopted, will tend to still further increase the depopulation of France. . The wealth owned by negroes in the United States is offieiallv estimated at something like $300,000,000.
