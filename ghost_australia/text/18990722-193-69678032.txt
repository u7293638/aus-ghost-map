THE STORM-KING. Hark ! hark to the voice of the wild storm king. As he lashes the angry deep: : " Cruel stories of death in his clamour ring, And heard in the wake of his fearful wing. Are the tear-songs that women weep. He comes from the south'with a shrieking sound, With a'flash and a dash'bf fatia~`- - That leaps in its rage to the night profound Like ghosts of the lost ones winging round 10 search of their After-home. For many a mighty ship to-night Has suffered the monarch's power : For vain is the strife against his might; 'So many a ship, once staunchand tight, Has proven a sea-nymph's dower. O, sad is the sight of the raging sea I But sadder the sight on the sands : For up on the beach, 'neath the rough cliff's lea, Stand mothers, and wives, and children wee, In weeping and prayinig bands. And up to their feet each mocking wave Throws the sport of the wild storm-king: Fond fathers, and sons, add husbands brave, From a sinking ship and a sailor's grave, Where the' fiends of the storm-king sing. 'Tis truly a sight that is worth a song The cower of the smorm.king's play ; But think of the shore with its . weeping. throng, Where the cry goes out for the sailors strong To the light of the laughing day. . .
