The Return Fancy Dress Ball. THE people of Sydney have for years past been celebrated for their reciprocity in entertainment giving, whether it be in return for vice-regal or civic hospitality, and on eaoh occasion they have invariably tried their utmost to surpacs anything which has preceded it, and it Is the opinion of all those who were present at the Exhibitlon BuiIding last Wednesday night ttha tthe ball eclipsed all former entertainments in the shape of Fancy Dress Balls ever given by the citizens of Sydney. The grand fete given on Wednesday was, lt will be remembered, Initiated by many of the leading people of Sydney immediately after the princely ball given by the Right Worshipful the Mayor of Sydney in February last, to Sir Hercules Robinson on the eve of his depar- ture from the colony, and to the citizens of Sydney. And it must be acknowledged that the citizens have been most successful in offering to his Worship a very handsome return for his hospitality. The return ball committee, which included most of the leading citizens of Sydney—the executive committee, consisted of Messrs. R. B. Smith, and J. Hardy (chairmen), Pope, J. Merriman, Higgins, Jen- nings, C. C. Skarratt, W. Jolly, A. Hilder, S. Bur- dekin, G. Thornton, junior, G. Evans, and the honorary secretaries,Thomas Chapman, and John Hugh Davies—set to work in a right earnest manner, and, with their hon. secreta- ries, Messrs. T. J. Chapman, J.P., and J.H. Davies, and the executive secretary, Mr. Hewitt, determined to make the citizens' ball to the Mayor an affair worthy of reoord in the annals of the history of New South Wales ; and certainly they ought to be proud of the result, for all present confessed that the committee had far surpassed the most sanguine expectations. This is more to be wondered at, seeing that such a short time intervened between the time the Agricultural Society handed over the building and the time the committee took possession, scarcely six days. However, no time was lost, and work was entered on with considerable spirit; Mr. W. H. Walker, of the Survey Ofiice, belng entrusted with the preparation of the building for the ball. It was decided at once that the decora- tions should be floral, instead of the usual haavy "flag and banneret" ornamentation, and the aid of Messrs. Treseder, of the Dobroyds Nurseries, was secured to supply the necessary plants and flowers, and that well-known firm, in a very short space, provided the exotic plants and flowers for the oc- casion, which included, besides the gigantic Iily of Australia, samples of nearly all their potted plants, and with those, a profuse supply of lovely flowers. Mr. Walker made a really magnificent display, giving evidence of his ability as a decorative artist. On entering the porch provided for the alighting of visitors, quite a fairy scene met the gaze, for on either side of the vestibule were ranged plants of rare quality and flowers of every hue, interspersed with wreaths of ivy and camellias hanging from elegantly-gilt baskets, whlch gave quite an enchanting appearance to the entrance; but after passing the 'sacred portals'of the entrance another and more exquisite view was ready, for look where you would mirrors and consoles reflected a thousand lights, and the scene presented was of a most fairy-llke character. From all the columns hung wreaths of flowers, which scented the building with their delicious fragrance; and round each column was entwined spiral wreaths of flower-ornamented evergreens, terminating in handsome olusters of zamias. Between each arch were baskets of flowers similar to those seen at the entrance, and this elegant contrast to the sombre green of the wreaths was most delightful; and this class of decoration, it is surmised, will be followed in any future ball given in the city. The foun- tain presented a delicious relief to the surrounding decorations; from the top ivy wreaths were dropping in a most natural manner, and in the basin were plants of heavy foliage and ferns from tropical regions, all combined, giving the fountain a delightful appearance. The lighting of the building was most effective ; and, in addition to the ordinary sunlights and brackets in the wings, there were at each column gas branches of three lights, the globes of which were opal, ruby, and turquoise, and, in the centre, was inscribed the rendezvous for the votaries of terpsichore, each bracket denoting Chatsworth, Fern Bower, Fairy Nook, the Zoo, Bachelors' Retreat, Moonlight, Rotton Row, Love's Exchange, Cupid's Pillar, and the Strand. This idea emanated from Mr. J. H. Davies, one of the hon. secretaries, and was found an admirable arrangement for dancers to meet their partners. In the wings of the building were arranged the refreshment tables, which ran the entire length of either wing, and the accommodation provided was really excellent, for instead of blocking up the promenade with couches and heavy furni- ture, Mr. Walker arranged a succession of comfortable lounges, which in no way interfered with those on the move. The Young Australian Band, under Mr. Hardy, was placed on the stage, which presented a most attractive sight— orange trees in full fruit, bananas, cypresses, camellias, zamias, zaccas, thuzla, dræcinas, aloes, damonaræ, and numerous other plants and flowers, surmounted by a shield and a simple cluster of flags, all combined giving it a charming appearance. At the rear of the stage were the supper and retiring rooms for his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor and suite. They were sumptuously fitted up and furnished with great luxuriance, everything in the shape of comfort being provided for the vice-regal party. The gal- leries were beautifully carpeted, and seats provided for those who wished to gaze on the fairy scene below without let, hindrance, or discomfort, and this was readily afforded by the absence of the flag decorations of the previous ball. Around the galleries were placed card tables, but in conse- quence of the coldness of the night, dancing, and not card- playing, was the order. The arrangements made by the transit commissioners and the police for the street traffic were excellent, and although the crowds in the vicinity of the exhibition were immense, the good nature of the onlookers, and the suaviter of the police combined, pre- vented any unpleasantness arising. The people had congre- gated at every corner of the park gates anxious to catch a glimpse of the visitors, and whenever a good look at an Indian Nabob, a Turkish Pasha, a Russian Serf, or other quaint personage was obtained, the crowd set up a series of ironical cheers, but beyond a few mild rebukes from the peace officers, nothing further occurred. The company com- menced to arrive shortly before 8 o'clock, and from that up to half-past 11, the carriages rolled up in rapid succession. Pre- cisely at half-past 9 his Excellency the Lieut. Governor and party arrived, escorted by a detachment of mounted troopers and the crowd cheered heartily as the vice-regal party en- tered the gates of the park. On alighting, his Excellency and Miss Stephen were received by the executive committee, and on entering the ball-room, the band played the National Anthem, and the guests in a befitting manner received Her Majesty's representative, by forming in two lines as far as the dais on the right, which had been erected for the vice regal party. At a quarter to 10, the guests of the evening, the Right Worshipful the Mayor (O.J. Roberts, Esq., J.P.) and Mayoress of Sydney, and their children were also re- ceived by the reception committee, and formally escorted to the dais prepared for them, opposite to that of the vice-regal party. On entering the ball- room, the band played, " See, the Conquering Hero Comes," and the distinguished guests were received in a most cordial manner by the visitors, who by this time numbered about 1500\. The mayor wore his robes of office, and the mayoress was charmingly attired in a rich costume of white satin, her daughters being dressed similarly. When the guests of the evening had been comfortably seated the votaries of terpsi- chore commenced the work of the evening by seeking pro- gramme engagements. The programmes, specially designed and printed for the occasion, were works of art, and reflect the highest credit on Messrs Gibbs, Bhallard, and Co., of Sydney, who did both. The front page of the pro- gramme was magnificent in colouring and gold. Medallion portraits of the mayor and mayoress were on a shield in the centre, surrounded by a laurel wreath bearing the motto, Successus a Deo est. Above and around this shield were the roof and walls of the exhibi- tion building, and at the bottom a richly dressed party of dancers doing "Sir Roger." Over all is the inscription " Fancy Dress Ball given by the citizens to the Mayor and Mayoress of Sydney in the exhibition building." The back cover has in an oval gilt frame, a very good view of the build- ing, but on the principle of not knowing the quality of a book by its cover, the inside oo programme portion excelled the gorgeous exterior in its exquisite tinting—having a scroll with the list of dances, surrounded by a lovely border of flowers, foliage, and cupids, supported on the right by a view of Captain Cook's statue, and on the left, by one of the Town Hall. Inside the programme was a prettily tinted slip, on which were printed the names of the rendezvous in the build- ing, and attached to the programme was a gold Mordan pencil tethered by a gold cord, with bullion fringe hangings. Alto- gether, the production was magnificent, and citizens ought to feel proud that they have amongst them firms such as Gibbs, Shallard, who can turn out such splendid work. At 10 o'clock precisely, the first quadrille was started by the band, and immediately sets innumerable were formed all over the dancing area; the Lieutenant-Governor dancing with the Mayoress, and the Mayor having Miss Stephen as his partner. The music of this quadrille, composed on "Songs of the Day," was most exhilarating, and the set was thoroughly enjoyed. The masters of ceremonies were Messrs, A. Read, G. Buckleton, S. Stead, and G. Read, and right well did they do their duty, so that very little, if any inconvenience, was experienced by the dancers during the whole of the programme, which numbered 10 set and 14 circular dunces. The band, under Mr. G. Hardy, carried out their arduous duty in a most satis- factory manner, and executed the following music in excel- lent time and style:— 1\. Quadrille ... ... " Songs of the Day " 2\. Waltz ... ... "Nancy Lee" 3\. Lancers ... ... "Trial by Jury '* 4\. Polka Mazurka ... "Eliza" 5\. Waltz ... : ... "Leila" 6\. Quadrille ... . ' "Autumn" 7\. Galop ... ... "Jolly Brothers" 8\. Schottische... . ... "Mabel" 9\. Lancers . .... "Burlesque" 10\. Polka ... ... "Daisy" 11\. Quadrille ... ... " Madame Angot" 12\. Schottische... ... "Bunch of Roses" 13\.

"Masquerade" 24\. Galop ... ... "Valentine." In the intervals between the dances selections were played by Mr. W. G. Broadhurst on the organ, and the grand music of the Prophets and Huguenots, played as it was in a masterly style, was much enjoyed by the promenaders in the gallery. The scene from the gallery was most charm- ing, and one not easily forgotten. The admixture of the numerous visitors in groups, and the grandeur of the dresses can be more easily imagined than described; suffice it to say that such a brilliant assemblage of " nations" was never seen before in the Southern Hemisphere, the tout ensemble being worthy a picture from Frith. The night was deli- ciously cool, which kept the dancers at work, and from 10 till dawn next morning, Mr. Hardy and his musicians were kept at work. At midnight the vice-recal part and the guests of the evening adjourned to the private supper room, where a recherche collation had been laid by Compag- noni, the refreshment caterer, after partaking of which his Excellency proposed the health of the Mayor and Mayoress of Sydney, alluding to his Worship's entertainment given to the citizens in very flattering terms. The Mayor, in respond- ing, acknowledged in a happy manner, the great honour that the citizens had done him in inviting him to that splendid entertainment, which he considered was the grandest ball ever given in Sydney. The party then returned to the ball-room, and "mid- night sport and revelry, tipsy dance and jollity," became the order "until daylight did appear;" and it was not till " Old Sol" made his appearance that the hall was emptied. The ball bas been a most complete success, and the com- mittee, one and all, with the honorary secretaries, Messrs. Chapman and Davies, deserve the very best thanks of the citizens, for the abie manner in which they carried out the trust reposed in them. The refreshments and wines were of the highest order, and Compagnoni, the caterer, deserves every credit for the superiority of the viands—the attend- ance and bountiful supply of creature comforts provided. Some of the most beautiful and effective costumes prin- cipally worn by ladies, and accurate in detail, were made by Mdme. Croucher, the costumier of the Theatre Royal. Noticeable were the following:—A Spanish peasant dress of black, scarlet, and blue satin. Perhaps the most con- spicuous male dress in the ballroom was that worn by Mr. A. Burne. It was Folly, and was made up of colours of glaring green, blue, and scarlet, trimmed with gold. The breeches were green and white, and bore some very singular characters. The collar was an immense Eli- zabethian one, and sleeves were elaborately made after the fashion of the same period. The dress of a Neapolitan Fisherboy was most attractive. Miss Bailey as Young Aus- tralia, Miss Spencer as Maritana, Miss Williams as the Robber's Daughter, and Miss Roberts as La Perichole, were splendidly made dresses, by Madame Croucher. Mrs. J. H. Davies was costumed as Snowstorm, in a dress of black tarlatan, upon which had fallen the " light and fleecy snow," over which fell a veil of gauze that had a very pretty effect, while on her shoulder was perched a little Red Robin. Mr. James Kidman, jun., was so admirably disguised as the well-known Indian chief, "Sitting Bull," by Mr. Courtright, of Kelly and Leon's Company, as to baffle detec- tion by his most intimate friends; he wore the feathers, beads, and blanket, as seen in the picture of the war- rior. He maintained the manner of the warrior chief with more than ordinary attention and effect an effect heightened by the polite attendance of Policeman X. Miss King was dressed in the original costume of the Daughter of the Regiment. Mrs. Bruce Stevenson's dress, as the Brigand Queen, consisted of white satin body trimmed with gold lace, rich velvet skirt trimmed with gold lace, puce and white satin hat to match, and white satin scarf edged with gold fringe, Mrs. Thomas J. Chapman was attired as a Lady of the Court of Louis XIV.—Plain flowing dress of black velvet, encircled at the waist with a golden zone ; deep v-shaped opening, surrounded with lace and connected by a velvet lattice work ; demi-sleeves, with extremely wide lace flounces, headed by triple blue silk folds; low dress, in Smyrna brocade, deeply scalloped and finished off by a chenille and gold fringe. The brigand dress worn by Mr. J. H. Want was most appropriate to his stalwart form. Miss Windeyer wore a beautiful Rosalind dress of white merino, with broad green velvet border and gold lace. Mrs. Edwin Bennett wore a rich white silk, with broad gold lace trimmings, and a border of artificial flowers—a representation of Autumn. Mrs. A. Talbot was tastefully attired as the Ace of Hearts in a white silk, with velvet headdress, on which the ace figured prominently. A "Europa" dress, worn by Miss Moss, was very attractive, being a blue dress, and the name of the character inscribed in gold letters. A very pretty head- dress, a Pharo dress, worn by Mr. G. Russell, was a costly one of English manufacture. The very novel dress of a Tahitian chief, worn by Mr. P. Anderson, and composed of the very flimsy fibre of the cocoanut, was much noticed. Amongst the gentlemen there was one character also very noticeable—the "Rajah of Mysore," dressed in amber silk plush, with turban and jewelled crescent, with blue silk skirt and gold facings, the whole completed with a crimson silk plush cloak, trimmed with real ermine six inches wide. This dress was worn by Mr. Samuel Hordern. One of the most beautiful dresses worn by any lady was that of the Duchess of Gerolstein, represented by Mrs. Samuel Hordern, who adopted rather a different colour to that usually worn, but suiting her so admirably that she looked the character exactly—light-grey silk, slashed with gold; cap, sword, and orders all were complete. The following costumes were supplied by Mr. Thomas Baker:—Mrs. Heaton, Court dress of Henry II.'s reign.— Rich black silk velvet and white satin, magnificently trimmed with gold and ermine. Mrs. Jennings, Snow.—A costume of pink silk and gauze covered with flakes of down. Mrs. Hezlett, Golden Beetle.—An elegant costume of silk velvet and gold gauze, tastefully covered with beetles of gold. Mrs. Atkinson, Forget-me-not.—An elegant costume of sky-blue silk and gauze, prettily trimmed with flowers of forget-me-nots. Miss Cottie, Cord.—Spanish-shaped body of ruby-coloured satin, white Brussels net skirt, and choicely trimmed with chenille. Miss M'Encroe, Spanish Peasant.—The wearer and the dress were in perfect unison, both being extremely pretty. Mrs. Davison, Night.—A handsome costume of black silk velvet and silk tulle, thickly spangled with stars. Mrs. F. Bennett, Court dress of Louis XIII, reign.—A costume of rich black satin, very richly trimmed with cerise of same material, and a handsome wide real lace. Mrs. Moses, Duchess of Brandon.—Composed of a beautiful black satin, extensively trimmed with a costly real lace and pearls. Mrs. R. Driver, Grace Darling.—A particularly suitable and handsome costume composed of bordeaux and white cashmere, elaborately trimmed with gold braid, and having golden oars, life belt, and a headdress representing a lifeboat. The establishment of Mr. H. Savage furnished the follow- ing dresses :— Russian admiral suit, worn by Mr. J. Solomon ; claret-coloured cloth coat, with slashed fronts, cipher flaps and peaked cuffs, the whole having rich cut steel buttons down front, and badge of honour suspended from collar. Scarlet embroidery fronts, trousers blue cloth, with gold trimmings, an attache dress worn by Mr. H. Harris. Claude Melnotte, very rich dress worn by Mr. D. Barnett. Cos- tume of a Turk, worn by Mr. W. H. Lamb. The Windsor uniform, worn by Mr. F. E. Purchas. Lieutenant's uni- form, worn by Mr. K. Ascherberg. Fritz, of the opera Grand Duchess, very rlch and costly dress, worn by Mr. Jno. Spencer.
