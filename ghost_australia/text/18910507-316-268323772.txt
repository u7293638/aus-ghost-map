THE OBEIBN GHOST. i THE WHITE HGUEE OK THE CLIFF. ©2. W. H. B-dsseli m THE ABTI-Jacobei.) • When I came into this property -i was away abroad,- and it was snmc iame "before the agent wrote -to tell me the bouse was -ieady for me- I did not know the country at all, and -I had never seen the cliffis- of rSfoher which nse 700ft. above the. Atlantic.- The day I arrived-1 toot a , look at this house, and then walked to . the cliffs with a priest witlrwhom I waB going to dine atEnmstymon. . ,1 astonisbed and delighted at tho spectacle, the ocean rolling in from the -west, '"-The next;-pansh..'church in.'America/' -as bis reverenceisaid. I bad aiways beardtbere was some tradition, about the Hag's Head :and my family—Jiow some old lady who was walking near the cliir was -whisked into tbefsea-by-a suddenpuflof wind. And thcro ar,- such puffsl - And they're -very dangerous! Anyway,.the grandson- succeeded, and',they ;say> fhe , ghost of- the -old-woman began to •hauntlie'clifEs- -:. - - . , • . - Well! as I was driving home I thought tbat aB it was a beautiful .niooiibght mght, and a good breeze .wjie blowing-from the -west, I wonld take a look' at. ihs , breakers they were-roaring like-artillery. So I got -out of the gig and told the boy to-go. home and bid a servant wait up for me. I struck across- the- sward straight for ;the -Hag's' Head.-.-"I iad got withm 70yds.-or SOyds.- of it when I saw on the very edge of the-cliff a white figure. It was moving: alive and no mistake. At first I thought .it was a sheen, but;: getting nearer, I,perceived that . ii: .waB a woman.m.a white dress, with ,a . white -cap on her lead. Then I .remembered that there was some.talk at'dinner of a lunatic girl who bad escaped out of the asylum at Eunistymon. I.madei .sure that it, was .she, and. I- thought I had just arrived m -tune-to. savg her life^. poor creature! JHy plan was to creep quietly behind her,-seize her in- my arms, drag her as, far as l-conld from-the edge, then secure her and. haul:her somehow to: the road. • X had got close, and was just about to lay hold oflher, -when " the thing ' turned on me such a facp as no bntnaa being ever had—a death's iiead,,with:«yes. glaring,.-out of the -sockets, through taogled. -jnasses of snowwhite hair ! In an instant, wtth a screoch that rang chrough my brain." the tbiug'^ fell or.-threw itself.oTOr the face of the cliff- ' - . Jt was some seconds before I recovered the shock and.horror..- Then tremblingly I crept; onmy hands and knees to the verge of the clifi.; I. looked down on the raging sea. -As I was peering do wn oyer the Hag'B Head I saw m the moonlight,, some white objcct coming up the: face of the olifE straight to wards,me J I am. not; .superstitious', or-a 1 coward. I tried to persuade- myself it was a seal or a-great eea-guU, but-presently arms and ,-hands -were visible-T-it -was 'crawling hand over-hand up the cliff; Ijumped to my feet and .ran for - my ..life towards my bouse. As. I ran,the.yell, the thing gave when -it-disappeared over the cliff was repeated- Iiookmg bank there was :the, dreadful sight It camo over,the green meadow in, pursuit; of me,-,, came nearer,-: nearer,not . 200 yards' behind. bounded.
