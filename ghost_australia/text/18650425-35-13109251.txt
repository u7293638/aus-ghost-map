closely past the boys, addressing some little remark to most of them When their Majesties had withdrawn, ices, tact and t-anrtssielics were handed round, and when these had been disposed of the young

honor at a sale of the kind being given on a rid ly, and Fccni even more scandalised at the sandwiches than at the chief delights of the dinner The sensation excited by the late famous Lncjclica "surface having sill sided explanations and apologies are coming out by the score and Antonelli, not satisfied nothing In fit circular, informing all bishops that Our a most Holy and most Sovereign Lord the Pope did not intend tbccightvpiopoMtions to be considered as dogmas, or absolute hay, has written to Bishop Dupanloup, assuring him that the condemn action of the errors enumerated in the war chest need not in any way disturb the consciences of Catholics, nor hinder them from fulfilling their duties as jtoodciti/ins, nor from keeping their oaths to the constitu- tion of the country where the liberty of worship is guaranteed ' Yet, not to speak of political es tots the recent Papal utterances condemn as "damnable -the normality of clergymen to the civil power, lay education, the secularisation of ecclesiastical property, civil ninia mge, liberty of conscience, and every office faith of worship than those of Home '-the indefatigable cardinal has now and irfS'cel a second note to all nuncios, internuncios, and change disposes of the Papal Government, intended to explain away the obnoxious condemnation which, he says, " are not accompanied by theological defini- tions and that "the pi excise meaning of the condemnations must be sought in the sense of the Bnejclicals, Apostolical letters, and allegations which are cited after each of the condemnations ' In plain English, that the wily cardinal, who did his uttriosOo prey ent the prevention of the late challenge addressed t5*iríodern civilisation would furn endure all Papal agents to regard that publication as not having taken place the Spanish and Portuguese Governments have exactly imitated the action of the French in regard to the Papal documents, permitting the clergy to announce the jubilee, but forbidding the publication of the Encj cheat and the Syllabus , As for France St seems not improbably that the famous documents still have the effect of strengthening the party that would like to see the Concordat abolished, the flemish creed left, like all the others, to the convictions of those who hold it, and the State entirely separated from all connection with religious dogmas and ecclesiastical institutions A similar result will probably be seen in Italy, where the higher clergy almost to a man, have published defiant declarations of their determination to publish every word of the for bidden documents, and boldly state then determination to maintain their allegiance to the Spiritual Post er as superior tothcpowci of the Government Cardinal Andrea, meantime, is taking good care to inform the world that whatever he may have said in former days, he now wishes to be considered as an Italian patriot An ether Neapolitan cardinal, Monsignor de Ville, has just left Rome, having been suddenly sent into exile by the Pope Cardinal de Ville was the Pope's private chamberlain, and, as such, one of the privileged persons whose place is in the antechamber of St Peter, and why assist the Pope on ceremonial occasions The pretext assigned for the measure is strange enough The Cardinal's baggage, on his return from a recent visit to Naples, was opened by the authorities of the Papal Custom-house ; against this proceeding the Cardinal protested, as a violation of his official rights; the protest was disregarded,., the homage searched, and the ? Cardinal accused of writing to smuggle in a quantity, of pictures, which are said to have been seized. The Cardinal brought an action against the Minister of Commerce; the verdict was given against him, and he then, being of French descent, though born in Naples, addressed himself to the French Ambas- Butler, and claimed his protection. The Ambassador sent a note forthwith to Antonelli, and Antonelli showed this note to the Pope. The Pope immediately wrote on the margin, " A week is allowed to Monsignor de Ville to go from Home to the French." As the grandees of the Papal Court, as well as the higher members of the Roman aristocracy, are never subjected to examination by the Custom-house people, the Romans suppose that this unusual treatment and summary expulsion of Monsignor de Ville is to be attributed to his being of French descent. The Italian Parliament has adopted Ricasoli's amendment, old disposed of the motions for inquiry into the regrettable tumult of September last by passing to the Order of the Day. The Mazzinians and clericals, who are now fighting on the same side, are furious at having lost the opportunity on which they had counted so fully for their joint attack on the Convention and the Government. Tuectiny is agitating for the abolition of capital punishment for all Italy. In 1786, the then Grand Duke, Peter Leopold, having read the celebrated work of Bcecarfa, abolished the torture, caused all the instruments of torture in Florence to be publicly burned in the Court of the Bargello, and suppressed capital punishment. Ferdinand III. re-established the death penalty in 1795; and the Bourbons, at the Restoration, maintained it until 1914. When Lucca was annexed to Tuscany, in 1847, the death penalty was abolished in that duchy also. In 1848, the Guerazzi SomMielli ministry formally abolished capital punishment, which, though the laws restoring it had fallen into practical desuetude, still existed in the statutes of the Grand Duchy, though, by means of the application of " extenuating circumstances, the Judges had contrived through a period of thirty-five years to prevent any execution from taking place, except in regard to the horrible monster, who had turned an entire family to death, and was executed for that atrocious crime. In 1853 capital punishment was again established by the new penal code, but only one execution took place, viz., that of a ruffian who murdered an Englishman under circumstances of peculiar atrocity. The Provisional Government of 1859 again suppressed the death penalty, which is generally unpopular in Tuscany, and it has remained suppressed until the present time, The translation of the seat of Government to Florence has led to a demand by the other provinces for an assimilation of the Tuscan legislation to that of the rest of Italy. Hence the counter movement got up by the Tuscans, who are extremely averse to see the death penalty re-established, and demand, on the contrary, the assimilation of the legislation of the other provinces to their own, in so far as regards the suppression of capital punishment. I he slight attempts to induce a riot, on the defeat of the motion for inquiry into the events of September, have been defeated by the good sense of the" Turincse, and the energetic attitude of the authorities. The first court ball has gone off with great eclat; and the gay world of the old northern capital, so soon to be deserted, is busy with the round of small gatherings that are so much for e the fashion there than the large roots of other capitals. Prince Umberto has delighted the Neapolitans by beginning a series of brilliant fetes ; his first ball was a very successful affair, and he is now organising a couple of umscmeiades for the coming Carnival, to the great joy of the lively ex-capital. One of those masquerades is to represent a grand hunt, in which are to figure a great variety of mag ? nificent costumes ; the second is to present a sort of tableau which, recalling some romantic incident of the Middle Ages. The sales of ecclesiastical property in Nazis are going on most successfully; the buyers, undeterred by j priestly menaces and reactionary prophecies, flock in crowds I To theSe sales, and the latter often realise from four I to six times the sums at which the lots have been mined by the Government appraisers. The Italian Government has determined to establish a naval station in the Gulf of Mexico, and one on the Pacific. Ships for these destinations are being built at Genoa. A duel of words has taken place in the Senate at Madrid, between the Duke of Tetuan (Marshal O'Donnell), who vigorously opposed the withdrawal of the Spanish forces them San Domingo, declaring that had he been at the head of the expedition he would have pledged his life on the destruction of the island in three months, and the Marquis de la Havana (Prim) who, after paying ample homage to the talents, influence, and military prestige of the noble Duke," contended, that the conquest of San Domingo would be ISZ?, I!fli;ul,t,<eat than a campaign in Africa, and that an attempt to hold the island, against the climate, the forests, and the savagery of the blacks, would lead to a loss of blood ^lir????i.ut-terly "proportionate to its worth, and would issue a .I,ncessilnt repression of incessant insurrections differ; i c«0!0 one. hand by Haydon the other by over? 40 soon?'- As the Minister of the Colonies had sailed the expenditure caused by the war at stTilÄnlc^lIn^^. and the deficit inthorevenuoofCuba than 500, sterner 'it is not surprising that the Senate, though greatly excited by the eloquent tirade of O'Don mVn'trfQ ' y r first majority, in favour of the retire SkM. v W Brom ^e »««IOUS crusade of re- conquest on Fin»A?a-(LcnteÎïdVIn the Chamber of Deputies the «wh^coMic'Bter.

those unlucky territories, and Austria is evidently in Patient to see the affair settled by the installation of Prince Frederic The Duchies, meantime, have been gratified by the restoration of the administrative union which existed between them previous to 1848, the seat of which is again established, as formerly, at the chateau of Gottorp in Schleswig During the latter period of their union with Denmark the administration of each duchy was conducted separately, to the great displeasure of the German element Trio union of the territories has been further promoted by the establishment of a common treasury at Rendsburg, and a central administration of the Customs and telegraphic department at Flensburg The hitch in the relation of the Prussian Crown and Chambers still threatens trouble

have seen to be no joke The Deputies seem determined to remain firm in the assertion of then Parliamentary light and duty, and the citizens of Cologne base sent to Count Von Grabow, the President of the Chamber, as a mark of their approbation of his great speech at the opening of the session, a civic crown in the share of a garland of oak leaves, of pure silver, with an enthusiastic address Some of the Paris papers are angry with the newly arrived Austrian Ambassador at Mexico, because, in expressing his good wishes for " the prosperity of the country which Providence has placed under your Majesty's sceptre, and say that, seeing the part taken by France in setting up the mess empire, it is rather too bad to leave out all mention of lance, and attribute the ssholecietlit of the stork to

to see him, but those two eminent authorities do not seem to think there is much the matter Friday, February 10 W Rates as may be the opinion of the rest of the world on the merits of the great struggle now pending across the Atlantic, the instincts and sympathies of our common humanity must preclude the possibility of our regarding with no difference either the frightful amount of suffering and mortality caused by a war carried on upon so unprecedented a search of the efforts which have been made with a view to the mitigation, as far as the nature of the case permits, of those terrible products- of the battle field It may not, therefore, be any teresting to the readers of the Sydney Herald and to learn that a very able and graphic account of the origin, organisation, and results of the vast philanthropic association, which, under the name of "The Sanitary Commission " has done so much to alleviate the horrors of the grievous contest now raging in the once United States of America, has just been published by that most fortunate of specialists, Thomas W Evans, M D , who holds the appointment of surgeon dentist to the Emperors of France and Russia, and all the other crowned heads of Europe, including the Sultan of Turkey, and who possesses stars and orders almost past the counting, paid a private practice Eo extensive and lucrative as to render him an object of envy to his brother practitioners This gentleman has recently made a stay of several months in the United States, whither he had gone for the purpose of visiting the scene of war, and collecting materials for the work in question from the data furnished by Dr Evans, it appears that the grant of organisation which so greatly impeded the first attempts at military action on the part of the North was still more evident in the utter absence of all provision for maintaining the health of its armies, and for the care of the sick and wounded The mortality consequent on such a state of things was necessarily enormous, and so narrow ing were me descriptions given by eye-witnesses of the sufferings endured by the army for want of proper clothing, food, hospital comforts, and appliances for the relief of the wounded, that a group of ladies belonging to the most influential and respected families of New York, stimulated by the example of the heroic Florence I Nightingale, determined to emulate the efforts ' w Inch had produced such excellent results among the British forces in the Ci smear campaign To this end, these ladies drew up and published an Appeal, addressed to the women of the city, and inviting them to a public meeting for the purpose of forming a regular association, having for its twofold aim the preservation of the health of the soldiers in the camp by due attention to hygienic conditions, and the organisation of ambulances hospitals, and supplies of everything needed for the cure of the sick and the relief of the wounded This meeting-the largest assemblage of the fair sex that has over taken place in the New World was held on the 29th of April, 1861, in the great hall of the Cooper Institute, and was presided over by Mr Hamlin, Vice-President of tbeUnitedStates, thcxvell-knownpa tors, Dr Bellows and Dr Bethune and the venerable phelan thropist Dr Mott, all of whom addressed the meeting, setting forth the necessity of immediate action in order to prey cut disease and mortality in the camp, and to palliate the terrible sufferings of the battle field and the hospital Such was the enthusiasm of the meeting, and so great the aptitude for business manifested by its leaders, that before it separated the proposed association was regularly formed, its officers appointed, its scope defined, and its mode of action distinctly laid down The new body, which had assumed the name of the " Central Sanitary Commission," though composed of women, had preferred, from motives of copy eminence, to choose its principal officers from the other sex Dr Mott, who stands at the head of the medical profession in the States was made president, the Rev Dr Bellows by one pi resident, and the distinguished writer, T LawOhnsted, secretary general No sooner had the Commission thus constituted itself, ] than it took the proper steps for obtaining its legal recogni- tion by the Government of the United States, instituted a commission of inquiry into the sanitary state of the army, in all the numerous branches of that complicated subject, established an official correspondence with the medical staff of the Federal army, entered into alliance with by serious medical associations in view of aid which these were requested to contribute, issued stirring appeals calling upon the women of every section of the United States to form local branch associations for collecting funds and furthering the aims of the Commission, established a central magazine of line and bandages, and opened an office for the examination and legislation of nurses of both sexes, able to perform hospital duty for the sick and wounded, and willing to proceed to any point to which they should be sent by the directress The formation of the Commission was warmly approved by the Minister of War, by General Scott, then Commander in Chief of the Federal forces, and by all the leading authorities , civil and military, of the North, many of whom, including General Scott, hastened to enrol themselves among its officers The, new association endeavoured to act concert with the "Medical Bureau, the official organ of the Government for all that concerned the physical necessities of the army But that body, though utterly unable to cope with the necessities of a struggle at once so colossal and so sudden, was extremely jealous of the Commission, which it regarded as an interloper and a rival, and continued with the usual ingenious obstructiveness of red tapeism to throw so many obstacles in the way of the latter, that the Commission soon found itself compelled to break off the attempt to unite with that body in a common action, and thenceforth followed a perfectly independent course of action p ii he Central Commission soon found itself at the head of fifteen sub commissions established in the principal cities of the North, and of no less than 35,000 branch societies, all of which were zealously at work collecting funds and contributions in kind, making line, devising improvements of various kinds, recruiting nurses, and furthering the objects of the Central Commission with which, through the sub commissions, they were in constant communication Such xi as the zeal of these associations, and so general was the response of the entire community to their appeals for help, that the contributions, in good. and in money, received by the Central Commission amounted at the date of October, 1862, to the astounding sum of £40,000,000 sterling, That the efforts of this large philanthropy have not slackened since that period may be inferred from the fact that in October, 1864, the Commission had received from women quantities of clothing and stores of all kinds whose collective value was nearly £2,000,000 sterling, and £133 000 sterling in money To all these sums collected without the slightest help from Government, must be added the proceeds of the great sales which were organised in several of the principal cities, the people of each State contributing what ever they could give to be sold for the benefit of the cause One of these sales being advertised to be held at Chicago on the 26th of October, 1863, and the four following days, the lines of waggons that rumbled heavily into that city, bringing the gifts of the people of the State from far and wide, were five kilometres in length These waggons, generally driven by the farmer or mechanic who had done most towards getting them filled, contained grain, flour, beef, hams, bacon, dried fish, candles, flax, preserves, totatoes, wood, machinery, nails, furniture, paper, jewellery, cloth, cotton goods, boots and shoes, pianos, watches, clocks, arms, boats, sledges, baskets, pottery, lamps, wooden-ware-something, infect, of everything produced by the State of Michigan A vast restaurant was organised by the ladies of the town for feeding the crowds of buyers who flTCkedto the sale from all the States of the Union For *iî,Î2,1?»Vh! «tydtaded itself into quarters," each quarter" divided itself into "wards," and each "ward" sent in a list of the contributions it was prepared to furnish during the five days over which the sale was to extend Thus, for Monday, the house No 1; First-street, promised 50 lbs of roast beef, No 2, 60 cauliflowers, No 1, 20 apple tarts , No 4, 20 lbs of broad, No 5, 26 roast turkeys, No 6, 12lbs otcronberry sauce, No 720 lbs of potatoes, and so on For each day a similar hat of contributions st as made up by one of the " quarters " One hundred of the prettiestgirlsof the town, many of them the daughters of the richest and most " aristocratic " families volunteered their services as waiters, a numerous corps of aids being contributed by the young gentlemen of the place, the honour of being admitted to help the fair waters being eagerly contested by all the youths of the city This restaurant of a novel order Supplied all comers with an excellent dinner at a charge of fivepence English, the profits resulting from the " sale, inclusive of the money taken at the restaurant, amounting to £160 000 sterling A similar "sale" got up at Cincinnati produced £56,000, one at Brooklyn produced £84,000, one at Philadelphia Sroduccd £240,000 , one at New York pro used £280,000, all of which sums were paid over at once to the Central Commission Besides the large amounts thus obtained, considerable additions to the general fund have been made by the isolated gifts of individuals who have carried goods or money to the branch societies- nearest their place of residence The Americans resident in Europe have sent in to the Central Commission something over £16,000 The collecting, transmission, and employment of the vast funds thus placed by private benevolence in the hands of the Sanitary Commission, have been effected at a total cost of four percent With the aid of these magnificent contributions, and through the instrumentality of the numerous bands of volunteers, of both sexes, who have enrolled themselves on the registers of the Commissioners, and who proceed to any point indicated by the Commission, giving their services gratuitously during their stay, this great and active association has been enabled to conduct careful inquiries into the sanitary conditions of camps and hospital and to carry out in both the important ameliorations advanced by the able scientific men by whom these inquiries were conducted By its exertions, not only have extra clothing and rations been largely provided for the Federal armies, but various important innovations have been introduced into camp and hospital building whereby the ventilation, drainage, kitchens, chimneys, and general convenience and 1 healthiness of these edihccshavebeen greatly improved New machinery has been specially devised for lightening the labours of camp servants and hospital assistants, new i ailss ay carriages and ambulance waggons have been does used for reducing the suffering attendant on the transport of the wounded, bodies of nurses of both sexes, divided into companies, presided over by skilful leaders, and accompanied by their respective doctors, surgeons, cooks and ants, and amply provided with beds, blankets, pillows, line, line, food, wine, and hospital stores, have followed fhendsancoof the armies, and established themselves in close vicinity to the field of battle, bestowing their help alike on friend and foe In some instances, when it has been possible for the Federal General to indicate beforehand the scene of an approaching contest, these emissaries of mercy have preceded the army, and set up their tents before the meeting of the hostile forces Ike Hospital Volunteers are recruited from every calling, and from every rank of life authors, artists, clergymen, lawyers, shopkeepers, mechanics, farmer B, and day labourers, entering their names for one or more days, for a week, or a month, of gratuitous service, during which time they are at the mercy of the Commissioners, and are lodged and fed in the special sleeping and cook- ing tints provided for their accommodation The Commission has organised a similar system of help and service on board the numerous floating hospitals it has provided on the principal rivers of the seat of war It has also provided post offices, workshops, libraries, and various means of healthy recicatiqrrfoi the soldiers in camp, and for the con salosientB in the hospitals and has provided at certain of its fixed centres of operation stores of writing and mining material, and printing presses, with the aid of which newspapers are regularly published by the soldiers themselves Dr Evans cites, among others of these mihtoryJoarnStlsî" The A) i tom y 'qua) e Jfcspttal Gazette, at Washington, edited, and magnificently punted, by the convalescents at the Armoury Square Hospital, which contains a thousand beds This newspaper, which has appealed regularly for more than a year, is sold, as are all the others, for the benefit of the sanitary commission Some idea may be formed of the scale on which the operations of the sanitary commission are carried on, from the fact that its fleet of hospital ships already consists of two enormous steamers, six smaller steamers, and two "floating hospitals," on the Atlantic coast, and eight large river steamboats which move up and down the great stream of the seat of war, following the movements of the various corps d'armee Among the various highly interesting testimonials to the usefulness of the operations of the commission cited by Dr Evans, is a most touching letter, addressed by one of its commissaries to its chiefs in New York, describing the joy of the sick and wounded, and of their regular attendants, at the reception among the feverish and purnd marshes of Tennessee, of the cargo of ice, fresh bread, ten, wine, new broth, fruit, vegetables-, preserves, hammocks, linen, clothing, mattresses, cushions, | blankets, &c;, for the want of which the sick and wounded were dying, and the sound were telling ill. 'ino excellence of its arrangements for the transport of the wounded may be measured by the declaration of Dr. Barnum, who states, in his report on his experience in that department in the West, that since he has been engaged in superintending the railway ambulance trains, he has transported 20,472 patients, of whom he has lost only one, who, notwithstanding _ the urgent remonstrances of the surgeon and his own, persisted in imploring that he might " be sent home to die in the bosom of his family." . Want of space precludes my following the author of this interesting work into the detailed account he gives of the operations of the Commission, and of the results accomplished, to the excellence and importance of which all the generals who have commanded the Federal armies, and many of the Southern generals also have borne ample testimony. Suffice it to say that while the Sanitary Commission has carried off the palm for a larger, more enlightened, and more successful application of private charity to the alleviation of the honors and sufferings of war than the world has yet seen, the example set by it has been nobly followed, though on a smaller scale, by various local associations, improvised on various points of the North, for the same objects. From the partial information which, alone, was accessible to Dr. Evans, it appears that the women of the Confederate States have not been behind their sisters of the North in their generous ardour; but have organised under similar auspices, and with proportionate success, according to their more limited means, a similar system of camp and hospital relief which, under tho name of the " Soldiers' Aid Society," has emulated the zeal and devotion of its northern proto- type. To all who, hopeless of any immediate conquest of an angry world by the principles of the Peace Society, are interested, either from a scientific or a humane point of view, in the diminution of the sufferings and mortality of war, the work in question, with its full details of the organ sation and result of the Sanitary Commission of the United States, supplemented with valuable statistics of the military hospitals of that country, and of the hospital department of the allied armies in the late Italian campaign, which Dr. Evans, under the auspices of his Imperial patron, was enabled to investigate in detail!, will be welcome both for the importance of its information and its manifold sugges tiveness, and for the spirit of enlightened philanthropy which pervades its pages. Saturday, February 18. We are, just now, as gay as the constant round of dinners, balls, soirees, public and private theatricals and concerts in which Paris always indulges at this occasion-can make us. The autocrats of the toilette have decided onthocos tunic of their subjects for the present winter and your readers may understand that dresses are worn enormously full at the bottom, but "sloped" towards the waist (thus avoiding the defect of bunches"), very much trimmed, and very long behind ; so that, for the street, it is absolutely necessary to keep them up, and indoors equally necessary to resign yourself (if of the gown wearing half of humanity to let them be walked upon by everybody who comes near you. The only remark called for as te tissues is to the effect' that satins are evidently coming ostrich, stiff, soft, great-grandmothers satins that can stand alone, and make the rich, lustrous folds and " wrinkles" that look so fine in fine old pictures. For trimming, overy modiste has her own style, and all are " admitted." Flounces are again become things of the past and future, but every other imaginable style is in vogue ; fringes, embroidery, ribbons, trimmings, lace, jet spangles, beads, pearls, blonde, gimps, chenille, buttons, large round cord, velvet, all are used. Ivory, silver, gilding, jet, and steel, are all used in buttons, bags, pendents, and lace. A recent dress that created a sensation at the Tuileries ball was of rose-coloured satin, five skirts of which, worn one above the other, were lavishly trimmed with steel lace and steel points. Think of the weight of such a gown, oh, happy masculine readers, and bless your lucky stars that you are never tempted to crush yourselves under such a weight of finely and folly, even for the sake of dazzling all eyes with the sheen of a completeness of steel, such as that worn by the lady in question, who sported a necklace, earrings, stomacher, and bracelets of that material, producing an effect considered to be equally "striking and charming." Bonnets are now worn BO excessively small and close that it is hardly worth while to mention them ; the back hair is left exposed, the bonnet " consisting of a fanchon (small half handkerchief), just big enough to cover the top and sides of the head and to carry a feather outside and a couple of flowers inside. A mite of a bonnet, of white tulle, just made by Hofflo for the Empress, is almost covered with little green Mexican beetles ; another is equally devoted to beetles, and the tiny white snails, like mother-of-pearl, of which Venice is popularly believed to have a monopoly. Crinolines are worn very much smaller than formerly ; the height of perfection, as regards the hang of a skirt, being now the combination of nothing in front, with a comet-like trailing out, for two or three feet, behind. The new style of hairdressing (a return to the absurdities in vogue under the generally adopted. With this style of hair, the head is stuck over with flowers, or ornaments of diamonds, and a wreath is wound round it, and falls over the shoulders. Jewellery is large and showy, and all sorts of eccentric fancies, side up of gold, enamel, and jewels, are worn. for instance, the great new jeweller, Samper, has, at this time, in his windows, a pair of earrings, i -Jews .<»»?»*«« of twin cherries, as large as the islands. y 'excess of hollow gold, enamelled red, with gold trials. A' imitations of nature, these cherries are eight site, one can fancy the birds pecking at them But such things, as on naments, are evidently entirely out of place In Riccardo the male toilette, no other novelty is visible save the substitution of velvet for broadcloth, who his occasionally attempted by innovating spirit, the velvet looking so much prettier than its name that one would fain felt more generally adopted Tnt splendid fete given on Saturday last, at the Palais Royal, at which the Imperial faintly, the diplomatic body, and a wonderful gathering of fashion, art science, literature, the Press, Polish refugees, and Italian democracies were brought into contact with the ministerial, official, and financial world, has been by far the most brilliant success of the season Prince Napoleon, whose sympathies and antipathies are well knows, issued nearly three thousand invitations, including people of every class opinion, and nationality, except priests and Russians The Emperor may possibly have winced a little at finding himself in company with General Turn, and so many of Garibaldi's intimate friends , but nothing could exceed the apparent cordiality of the Imperial pan and then princely hosts It was the first grand ball given by Prince Napoleon and Princess Clotilda, and every one was curious to see how they would acquit themselves of the duties, Prince Napoleon, naturally blunt in manner, disliking ceremonious grandeur, and Princess Clotilda being extremely shy and timid, and always trying to run away if any one looks at her But the curiously assorted couple did the honours with so much grace and affability, had such pleasant little remarks ready for each guest, and welcomed everyone with so much cordiality, that the affair has been a triumph for their reputation as hosts The Palms Royal is a very beautiful residence, and Prince Napoleon, who is a passionate lover of at and a very accomplished connoisseur, has spent immense sums in the art collections with which he has filled the two and twenty splendid reception rooms of that noble palace, all of which were thrown open on the occasion, their contents being left by the Prince's command in exactly their usual order The splendid entrance hall was converted into a thicket of flow sang shrubs, flowers being most tastefully distributed through all the rooms The lighting ss as magnificent, the two orchestras superb, and the refreshments the most exquisite that Paris could finish, and the supper "muscle ' of artistic cookery On this splendid affair, at which the display of jewellery was unusually magnificent, and the toilettes of the ladies as lava hly fine as such things can be, (thcguitlcmcn, including the Emperor and Prince Napoleon, being in plain evening dress), the Prince spent £1200 The supper alone cost 150, the rest being spent in floss silk and lights The ceremony of the opening of the Legislative session took place in the fine old Medieval Hall of the Old Louvre, called the toilet des Debats, on Wednesday, with the usual pomp The hall, splendidly fitted up with crimson velvet and gold, the Emperors great gilded chair, and a smaller one for Prince Napoleon, being placed on the platform, under dais, at the upper end of the Hall, the Empress "Tribune,' partitioned off with velvet draperies, to the right of the throne, containing gilded chairs for herself and the princesses, the steps of the tin one being set apart for Cardinals, Bishops, Ministers, Generals, Pi elects, and other exalted functionaries, the body of the Hall filled with crimson benches for senators, deputies, the Courts, Bar, University, at, the Ambassadors leaving a corner of the gallery, with their ladies just beyond, the principal c exploits of the various Ministries opposite the Ambassadors, and then lady friends next to them, and the rest of the Hellenes, all round the vast, oblong Hall, crammed with ladies, who were sadly persecuted by the bland and smiling, but inflexible ushers, who kept tips perpetual process of squeezing and pushing, utterly regardless of crinoline, that resulted in finding seats for nearly all the dense cross ds of wearers of that uncomfortable adjunct By 11 o'clock the Hall was abse syifh uniforms and embroidery, and the galleries crammed to their utmost capacity By 12, the masses of costumes below pie senttdasei-ystnkmgeffect, and the gorgeous expansions of the Cent Gardens, behind the Throne, making a magnificent border and background to the whole A few minutes before one, the cannon, inaudible to those in the Hall, announced that the Imperial people were getting into their carriages to perform the journey of 800 yards between the door of the Tuileries and the Hall, the Grand Usher sented the Babel of gossip by announcing the Empress, every one rose, and turned towards the doors, and that graceful lady, in a dress and scarf of white satin, trimmed with a band of marone coloured feathers and deep white fringe, and a tiny white bonnet, no bigger than a cap, with a large feather and white crosses, advanced up the middle of the Hall, left open as a passage. The little Prince, in his little sergeant s uniform, walked beside his mamma, bossing also, and a group of princesses and ladies of honour, with one or two equerries, followed her Majesty The wonderful grace which, is the Empress's characteristic, has been too often spoken of to call for comment here, but so marvellous it is that every time one sees her, one is struck by it as though one had never seen it before She glides along like a wave, and when, amidst the vivas of the assembly, she had mounted the steps of the throne as no other woman could mount them, she turned round towards the gathering, and made one of those deep, smooth, slow curtseys which she alone is capable of making the entire assembly gave out a murmur of admiration. The Empress and her party had scarcely taken their seats when the usher announced the Emperor. The masses of colour, of embroidery, of quaint old-world costumes, all so distinctly defined in their special portions of the hall, seen in so splendid a locale and the hush of expectation that was so clearly perceptible throughout the gathering, rendered the scene at that moment, very striking and impressive. His Majesty, accompanied by Prince Napoleon, both in general's uniform, with the red riband of the Legion of Honour, and the Emperor wearing six miniature orders, followed the brilliant group of officers and chamberlains up the middle of the hall, the reception being pretty good, but not enthusiastic. The Emperor walked as usual bowing right and left, but with a slight holt that proves how difficult it is, even for wearers of Crowns, to get rid of the grip of rheumatism, and seated himself on the throne ; the Grand Master of the Ceremonies, the old Duke of CambncericB, desiring the Assembly to be seated. The Emperor took a roll of paper from a Chamberlain, and slowly unrolled it, amidst a silence that was no perceptible to the ear as sound. The anxiety of all to catch the first utterances of the Oracle was evidently intense and the increasing satisfaction, as the Emperor proceeded with his speech, was equally evident. The Emperor did not appear to me, who have so often heard him, to be perfectly at his case ; Possibly the knowledge that, under all graces of diplomatic manage the priestly gauntlet has been definitively thrown down, and that a secret war is henceforth to be waged by the powerful body he has favoured and petted, against him and his dynasty, may have affected even his impassive nerves. At all events, he made four times, a slight "bog- gle," seeming to mistake a word and correcting the mis- take a thing, I believe, he never did before. But the bursts of applause which accompanied the reading must have re- assured him. The passages recommending a policy of peace, and those which paid the usual tribute to the " glory " of the French arms, were equally applauded ; those which spoke of Italy and Mexico were warmly received, and both the allusions to his determinations, while maintaining the spiritual influence of the priesthood to maintain the supremacy of the civil power, were received with a tempest of applause; at the latter of two declarations on this point, the Assembly not only shouting " Vive l'Empereur !" at the top of their voices, but half of them waving their tri-colored hats in the exuberance of their approbation. On the conclusion of the Speech the plaudits were general, hearty, and twice-renewed. The swearing-in of the new members followed. The Grand Master then declared, by his Majesty's command, " that the Legislative Session of 1865 was opened, and invited the various bodies of the State to lend their efforts for the advancement of the public weal. The Emperor then quitted the hall, slowly, bowing, as he had entered it, but smiling as he went, and looking as though well pleased with the demonstration, the Assembly standing, and making full use of its lungs in his honour. After the Emperor had left with his suite, the Empress and little Prince, followed as before took their departure amidst a chorus of privates. The little Prince has a charming face, and his bows, so comically child-like and yet full of conscious dignity, seemed immensely to amuse and delight the assemblage. Everybody bent forward, laughing and bowing to see the little creature as he moved on by his mother's side, and all of them looked as though they would have enjoyed the possibility of bestowing a parental kiss on him. An immensô"cr«1wd-filled the square outside and the adjoining streets, and seemed to take a lively satisfaction in seeing the carriages and their loads of male and female finery drive by through the double line of soldiers that had formed the hedge along the Imperial road. The principal domestic events of the week have been the censure of the recalcitrant Bishops by the Council of State, the letters of praise and felicitation addressed by the Nuncio to these very-prelates for the course which has drawn on them the censure of the Council ; the complaint sent to Rome by M. Drouyn de Lhuys, and published in the Moniteur, of this action of the Nuncio, which is qualified as an abuse of diplomatic privilege and a viola- tion of international law ; the Nuncio's apology to the Emperor for those letters, and now the arrival of shelter from Pius IX, praising the piety and devotedness of the inculpated prelates, and giving them his benediction for the action that had already created so much effervescence and scandal ! A very pretty and edifying imbroglio. Peace has been signed between Spain and Peru, the latter agreeing to pay to her ci-devant mistress the sum of 100 millions of years as a war indemnity. The expedition against San Domingo is definitively abandoned, and the small remains of the Spanish troops spared by fever and hardship are being brought back. Disturbances at Turin, of an insulting character to the King, hastened the departure of Victor Emmanuel for Florence, the population turning out at every point on the journey, and welcoming him with the utmost enthusiasm, and Florence improvising a fest a of flags, illuminations, and serenades in honour of King Honest man The King is said to have shed tears at quitting the old home of his fathers and his youth, and will doubtless accept graciously and gladly the penitential addresses which the people of Turin resigning. The fault of these regrettable manifestations, so suicidal in policy, and so singularly unjust to the King, who sacrifices all the pleasure of his life in quitting Turin, appears to be at the door of a few obstinate old Piedmontese nobles forming part of the municipality of Turin, and who, furious at seeing Turin deposed from its metropolitan pre-eminence, have made common cause with " the blacks and the reds" in this foolish and wicked attempt to throw obstacles in the way of the convention of September and the unity of Italy, to which that convention is so important a stepping-stone. Nothing is yet settled about the Duchies. The Prussian Government and Chambers are once more openly pitted against each other; but what can come of the quarrel was not easy to foresee. Meantime, we learn that Denmark is far ahead of all other countries, not even excepting Prussia, in the work of popular education. King Leopold has been ill, but is better. The Czar has refused to receive the depu- ties of the Assembly of Nobles of Moscow, and will not look at their late memorial praying him to grant a constitu- tion and parliamentary government to Russia, has advised them, through the Minister, to go home and take care of their own concerns, and informed them that " when the emancipation of the serfs is accomplished, and the Emperor Napoleon has crowned the edifice in France, it will be time enough for Russia to think about Constitutions and Parlia- ments." Monday, February 27th. We are in the midst, not of the gaiety of the Carnival, for that has been gradually diminishing, and is now all, but of its racket, the latter being still kept in the memory of the present by the outburst of the trumpets with which all the youngsters of the lower orders " assault the ears of the public at this season. As for the immemorial procession of the " Fat Oxen," during the three days of Shrovetide, it began yesterday, is going on while I write, and will come to a close to-morrow evening when the poor animals who have been exciting the curiosity of the town will end their exhibition and their lives in the grand new suburban slaughterhouses which are henceforth to be the scene of the conversion of cattle into beef for the Paris market. The Shrovetide show has been rather shabby for a few years past, but this year has come out with new splendour. The four monstrous animals which have obtained the fatal honours of the annual competition are named in honour of the four popular plays of the moment, Bataclan. Captain Jfcioiot, Master Guerin, and Old Bachelor. Those four have been accommodated with triumphal chariots, richly-j or at any rate, lavishly adorned with gilding, white point, flowers, ribands, and tinsel. Fourenormous chariots, equally gay, are filled with mythologies characters, and representing all the grandees of Olympus, from Father Time to Cupid and all of whom will, no doubt, pay for the honour of their apotheosis by having to go through with terrific colds, with Kings and Queens of France, fire-eating Paladins, knights in armour, and a variety of personages Borrowed from the pages of history and romance. All these, as also the bands of " lictors," " socrificators," we, are got up with more care and cost than usual, as is also the Master Butcher who, as I write, is playing so conspicuous a part in the tawdry pageant, arrayed as a Roman high priest. Four other oxen, the second prizes (so to say of the great Shrovetide Cattle Fair, are to-morrow to join the cortege, toiling wearily on foot. These four supplementary victims, in honour of the successful new newspapers of those names, are to be called respectively, "The Little Journal, "The Great Journal," "The Journal," and '-M- Journal." The usual escorts of national guards and policemen, and accompaniments of military bands, are taking part in the affair, but of masks none are to be seen. At home a good many children are, no doubt, rejoicing in masks that they are delighted to show off to all who happen to come to the house, pouncing out upon you, as you enter the parlour, with the head of a wolf of an age, on the face of an ogre, and fully believing in the reality of the demonstrations of terror with which you receive their onset. To-morrow night all Paris will dance-the " upper ten in palaces, and hotels almost as splendid-the lower twenties in the thousand ballrooms of carés and ''georgettes. The great masked ball at the French Opera will be wilder and madder than its eleven predecessors and then, with one other successor, on Easter Monday, the famous series of opera balls will be closed until next season. The preface to the Emperor's history of Julius Caesar has just been published in the Moniteur, and is being copied into all the other journals. This first instalment of the work, which from one end of Europe to the other is being waited for with so much interest and curiosity, opens with the. statement that truth should be the aim of the historian, and that the latter should not content himself with even the truth of fact, but should endeavour to bring to light the reasons of the facts of history, and to analyse alike the political and social movements which rendered each new fact possible, and those which result from it as its natural consequence. If the Romans, argues the Imperial writer, were triumphant for a thousand years, there must have been, in their antecedents and actual state, an adequate reason for those triumphs and also in the conditions of the nations over whom they triumphed, an adequate reason for their overthrow. In other words history is to be regarded, says the author, as the manifestation of a regular sequence of cause and effect, and as being worthily treated in proportion as this sequence is clearly shown, and made to contribute its true lessons for the enlightenment of the world. Passing from these general considerations on the production of events to the consideration of their authors, the writer declares that all men of eminent genius, whose quality is demonstrated by deeds that surpass the level of ordinary action, are privileged beings, " luminous beacons, dissipating the darkness of their times, and illuminating the I future," and deprecates the narrow appreciation that would I judge them by their weaker sides, attributing to men of genius the passions and sentiments of mediocrity, and dis painting the mental altitude to which narrow minded interpreters are unable to raise themselves. The object of the Imperial author is defined as being to prove that when Providence raises up such men as Caesar, Charle- magne, or Napoleon, it is to trace out to the nations the path, they ought to follow, and to show that the world is unwise in crucifying its Messiahs, instead of accepting them with open arms, and aiding them to lead it forward on its way to development. But though the world can kill its teachers, and thus retard its own progress, the influence of a man of genius lives on, and moulds succeeding ages by the impul- sion of his ideas. "Neither the murder of Caesar, nor the Captivity of St. Helena, was able to destroy the two popular causes, overthrown by a league that had covered itself with the mask of liberty. Brutus, by killing Caesar, did not prevent the reign of Augustus, but he rendered possible those of New and Caligula. Nor did the ostracism of Napoleon by the combined forces of Europe prevent the Empire from being re- established; and yet how far we are from the solu- tion of great questions, the pacification of passions, the legitimate satisfaction given to peoples by the First Empire I Thus, every day since 1895, has witnessed the fulfilment of the prophecy of the Captive of St. Helena :-' How much struggle, blood, and time will still be needed before the good that I would have done for humanity can be accomplished !' " It would, of course, be absurd to prejudge a work like that which is about to appear, by the preface of which I have given the brief foregoing resume ; but the friends of the Imperial writer may regret that the causes of the fall of the First Empire have not been more adequately summed up as they might so easily have been in this opening appeal from the judgment of half a century ago to that of our own day ; while those who are not sorry to avail themselves of an opportunity for criticising the restorer of the Empire, will not fail to protest against the inferential assumptions of its concluding paragraph, and to ask whether, in point of fact, and notwithstanding the generous desires expressed by the captive of St. Helena, it can be said that passions were appeased, and a legitimate satisfaction given to the populations of Europe, by the Conqueror of Marengo ? From the indiscretion of printers it has leaked out that the forthcoming first volume of the Imperial work is devoted to the history of Borne previous to the foundation of the Empire; that it consists, besides the preface, of 361 pages, divided into six books ; 1st, the Roman epoch anterior to Romulus ; 2nd, Rome under her kings ; 3rd, establishment of the Consular Republic ; 4th, Conquest of Italy with, the Punic, Macedonian, and Asiatic wars ; 6th, the Gracchi, Marius, and Syria. The work is being translated into English, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, Greek and Turkish. All the profits resulting from its publication in France, and the purchase of the right of translation, will be given to the poor. The great questions pending in Europe have made but slight advance during the past week. Prussia is still ingeniously throwing difficulties in the way of the settlement of the Duchies ; the schism between the Crown and the Parliament becomes wider daily, and the Government is professing its hopelessness of arriving at the conciliation it professes to desire, but which it will not yield an inch of its unconstitutional pretensions to render possible, and its determination, if the present Parliament prove intractable, Jo govern without a Budget, in other words to dispense with the trifling auxiliary of a Chamber! Austria is still opposing counter propositions to the transparently selfish propositions put forth by her rival ; is coquetting with the secondary States and has consented to the appointment of a permanent commission of three, to meet a similar band of three to be appointed by England, the united wisdom of the six commissioners being charged with the elaboration of a commercial treaty between the dominions of the Kaiser and those of Queen "Victoria. King Victor, whose worth affection for his native city could not fail to second the effect of the addresses of regret and loyalty sent to him by the TurneR, is spending a week in the ex-capital. His reception was enthusiastic, and his stay is a succession of ovations. On his appearing unexpectedly, the other evening, at the principal theatre, the audience received him with a tempest of loyal demonstration that almost threatened to preclude the regular business of the stage and though the " coalition of blacks and the reds" is making a fresh attempt to revive painful and irritating discussions by getting up a demand, on the part of the Senate, for an inquiry into the events of September last, it is probable that this unpatriotic attempt will be defeated by the moderation of the Upper House, as it has been by that of the Lower one. The King leaves for Milan on the 1st of March, and after giving a carnival ball will return to Florence, whither the various departments of the Government will be transferred as quickly as may be possible. The Court of Cassation is to be removed from Milan to Turin, the Milanese deputies voting for this change in acknowledgment of the generosity of Turin in voting the honour of making Milan. Turin is, moreover, rejoicing in the presence of a troupe of twenty hunchback, of both sexes, who are now performing at the Theatre d'Augeunes, and treating the Turinese to the most ranting tragedies, whose effect is said to be excessively trying to the intercostal muscles of their audience, being more provocative of laughter than the broadest farce. The Russians are still pushing on their campaign against capital punishment, which is repugnant to the humane and orderly character of their branch, of the Italian family, and which they are very unwilling to see re-established. Signor Ellero, Professor of Penal Law at the faculty of Bologna, has just drawn up a table of the States which have abolished the penalty of death In 1828, the Grand Duchy of Fin- land, 1,724,193 inhabitants; 1830, Louisiana, 709,290; 1 1831, Tahiti, 7000; 1846, Michigan, 397,654 ; 1849, Duchy of Nassau, 466,667; 1849, Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, 295,242; 1849, Duchy of Brunswick, 282,389; 1819, Duchy of Coburg, -17,014; 1852, Rhode Island, 147,621; 1859, San Marino, 8000; 1860, Roumania, 4,000,000: 1862, Grand Duchy of Weimar, 273,252; 1862, Grand Duchy of Saxe- Meiningen, 130,000 ; 1863, Canon of Neufchatel, 87,369; 1864, Columbia, 2,800,000. The general " rosy " created by the famous Encyclical has nearly died away. In Italy, the Government has permitted the publication of the document, on the ground, says the Ministerial permission, that the people of Italy are too far advanced on the path of progress to near without a smile the antiquated nonsense it contains and will consequently attach no sort of importance to its promulgation. The other Catholic countries have followed the example of France, permitting the clerical publication of parts of the late document and prohibiting others. In Paris, the Nuncio has apologised to the Emperor for his two letters of praise addressed to the recalcitrant Bishops, just as the Pope had written to the latter to praise and thank them for their heroic devotedness and piety in violating the laws of their country, and trampling on, the duties imposed on them by the Concordat. The Archbishop of Paris has come out with an address in which he tells the faithful shot when the Pope speaks they must accept as absolute truth every word he says, and that consequently they are not to discuss the Encyclical, but simply to obey it and then, after having laid down these broad proposi- tions of unreasoning obedience, he slides off, in the smooth cost and easiest way, into assurances, equally sweeping, that all truth is harmonious and convergent that it is the duty of all good citizens to obey the laws of their country, and that they have possibly fancied that the Papal proposi- tions militated against the common law of France and the spirit of progress in Europe, they maybe quite sure that they have mistaken the Pope's meaning, inasmuch as his Holiness, being the repository of wisdom and of the Holy Ghost, could not possibly have intended to place religious truth in opposition to the facts of progress and the principles which form the basis of modem society. From all of which " his grandeur " deduces the very convenient, though not very logical conclusion, that his flock is bound to receive the Encyclical with absolute submission, as " a rule of faith," but in no wise to trouble their heads as to its application to civil affairs. Considering that the famous utterance proclaims as " damnable" the heresies of civil marriage, lay education, exclusion of priests from civil tribunals, civil responsibility of ecclesiastics, toleration of schismatic, Mahommedan, or Jewish wool ship, liberty of conscience, and, in fact, all the gains which the world has made since the Dark Ages, the reasoning of Monseigneur Darboy, must be admitted to be as bold as it is ingenious. Before quitting the subject of the famous Encyclical, let me add the latest rumour that has reached us in relation to it, viz., that Liszt, who has been spending the winter in Rome, has become an ardent Catholic, and wants to become a Trappist, has just set the whole of that tremendous document to music General La Marmora has spent two days in Rome, shel tried by a transparent incognito understood by everybody. His passport gave his two first names, omitting La Marmora and was rise by Roman officials perfectly aware of his identity. The motive of his presence in Rome is not positively known ; but as he was constantly closeted with the French commander, General Count de Montebello, it is surmised that the subject of their conferences could hardly be other than the evacuation of Rome by the French forces. "His Excellency was treated with marked re- spect by all with whom he came in contact, and he left for Naples in company with his friend Prince Doria, without any molestation from the Roman Government. The Pope has sent an autograph letter to Maximilian, entreating him not to meddle with the ecclesiasti- si domains, not to tolerate any other form of religious 1 ' af or worship than the Roman Catholic, to forbid civil i ir riage, to give the education of youth entirely to the c1..- -?, and to protect the monasteries and the religious or J. If the new Emperor only grants these points, the 1 and -promises his blessing to the Emperor and the empire . --id predicts every species ofdiappiness and prosperity 1-. sea. We shall-'ieo^.wheüjcf* the liberal Sovereign of I'M new ' transatlantic monarchy will be inclined to accede. Ju these very modest little demands! i MeaiUirim,-''Maximilian, though excessively busy with reformator^coniinercial, and financial projects, FinE found time to institute a new order that of the Mexican Eagle, which is composed' of six classes-knight, officer, commander, grand officer,' grand cross, and grand cross with collar. The number of knights is unlimited, that of officers is fixed at 280, commanders at 100 ; grand officers, 50 ; grand- crosses, 25 and grand cross with, collar, 12. The first of the latter have been sent to the Emperor Napoleon, the second to Victor Emmanuel. The others are to be sent to the Emperors of Austria and Russia, and one or two kings and kingdoms for whom the new sovereign had a personal kindness. The Queen of Spain has presented to the nation property worth about four millions sterling. The bill drawn up by the General Administration of the Royal household and patrimony of the Crown, reserves the royal palaces and their dependencies, the museum of painting and sculpture, the royal museum of arms, the Alhambra of Granada,, the Alcazar of Seville as the perpetual patrimony of the Crown, but gives up all the other Crown lands and property of every kind to the State for ininíetlíate sale. Of the proceeds of the sale, 75 per cent, are to be paid into the public treasury, and 25 percent, into the treasury-of-the royal household. The Queen's resolve has been dictated by her generous desire to come in aid of the public treasury, so grievously embarrassed, and for the relief of which Signor Barzanallano's project of a forced loan has fallen through, owing to the strenuous resistance which the whole nation seems to have opposed to the measure. The Spaniards have been thrown into an extacy of gratitude by the Queen's spontaneous sacrifice, and addresses of loyalty and devotion are pouring in upon her Majesty from all the towns of the kingdom. Her example may possibly prove contagious, and may result in the voluntary offering of large sums by the patriotism of her people. The Governor of Barcelona, smitten by a generous emulation, has just contributed one-fourth of his year's salary to the wants of the Exchequer, and others, were said to be preparing to emulate his example. -' as...- - It seems we have all been in error in supposing China to be the most densely populated portion of the planet's surface. While England has 91 inhabitants to the square kilometre (five-eighths of a mile), Italy 85, France 69, Prussia 66, Austria 54, China 120, Little Belgium has 161 ! In 1836, the thriving little kingdom had but i 118 at the same rate of increase she will soon have five I inhabitants where there were formerly but three. King Leopold has been laid up with influenza, which kept him away from the last of the four brilliant Court balls which the Duchess of Brabant, in the absence of her amiable but consumptive husband, has been giving with such eclat to the grandees of the little northern Paris. The Belgian finances appear to be in a very flourishing state. The magnificent palace of the reigning Duke of Bruns- wick has been destroyed by fire, with, alas, a great quantity of valuable pictures, manuscripts, and works of art. It is decided that the International Exhibition of 1867 shall be held in the vast open square of the Champ de Mars, which will be almost covered by the magnificent structure to be built for its reception. The Government and the city of Paris will between them, guarantee a million sterling for the dual installation of the affair and for the prizes. Three Englishmen, Lords Granville and Cowley and Mr. Cobden, are included in the list of Imperial Commissioners, and are to be requested to give the aid of their judgment and experience in the management of the affair, which, under the presidency of Prince Napoleon, is expected to " take the shine out of" everything that has yet been seen in the shape of such a gathering. STELLA. EDUCATION or DISSENTERS IN CHURCH SCHOOLS. An interesting discussion on the educational " conscience clause" took place at a meeting of the Worcester Al chdeaconal Board, on the 17th January, Sir John Pakington moved a resolution tathe'ëffeçt^that the grants of the board should be made to the church schools of the archdeaconry, without considering the point whether the conscience clause was or was not acted upon. In some poor localities, he said, only one national school existed, and the adoption of the course he recommended would be merely an act of justice to Dissenters. The doctrines of the Church of England were, and would continue to be, taught in all their schools and all he proposed was that the children of Dissenters should be allowed to enter the schools under the protection of the conscience clause. In the discussion which followed, the motion was supported by the Bishop and opposed by Lord Lyttelton and Lord Redesdale. it was ultimately rejected by a vote of 49 against 16. THE JEWISH DIVORCE LAW NOT BINDING IN ENS i LAND-The case of Davis v. Harris was heard in the Sheriffs Court, London, on the 17th of January. This was an action to recover a sum of money for the keep of defendant's wife. It appeared from the evidence that the defendant had been separated from MR wife, and he had been sued in this Court upon a previous occasion, a verdict having passed against him. The defendant now said that in consequence of the misconduct of his wife he had been bankrupt in 1861. -His Honor : You have not pleaded your bankruptcy and besides, a bankrupt is bound to keep his wife. Defendant : I have been divorced from my xy life. His Honor : "What is the date of that divorce ? Defendant : It is a divorce according to the Jewish lawyers Honor : That will not do in this country. Defendant : My wife is now under bail for attempting my life. Here is the agreement under which my wife and I have been divorced. Upon his Honor reading the agreement he pronounced it worthless, and advised the defendant not to go to the expense of getting it stamped, as it would not act against a tradesman who supplied necessaries to his wife. Verdict for the plaintiff, with costs. INCIDENT AT A SURGICAL OPERATION The other day, at the Middlesex Hospital, in the presence of a numerous staff of surgeons, an opening was made in the throat of a milkman named Fairbrother, by Mr. Hulks, the house surgeon, for the purpose of extract- ing a sixpence which had lodged in the throat. Just as the operator's fingers were on the coin, Fairbrother made a sudden gale, which caused it to slip into the ,; stomach. The man is now doing well, and is out of . danger. The Royal Geographical Society has voted $100 towards the £200 required by Sir Henry James for the settlement of the level of the Dead Sea.
