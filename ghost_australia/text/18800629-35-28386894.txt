DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH GERM AN YÍ ._._-_?-._,_ ! TO THE EDITOR OF THJ_ HERALD. Sir.-With reference the letter uf " Advnnco AustialiaV' on this subject, I beg leavo to lemnik tlut tho pro*ect of ox direct lino of steamers between Ilumbuiu md byclnoy ap- pears to be decidedly piemature, and quite outside tho laugo of practical commerce. From oxpünenco gained dunuga, lengthened icsidcnce in Hamburg, I cun with homo denice 'of confidence asseit that thoio IB not tho ghost of a chance that such a scheme wouldpiovoromunoiutivc Thoiem* 'not at present a sufficiently largo market at cithpr end for the produco ot the Austialinn colonies, or of tho German Empire, and 1 am disposed to think that, uuttl tho trade has acquired much laiger dimensions, it will bo lound that merchunts will continuo, notwithstanding tho increased ex- pense, to make uso of London. With regard to the establishment of ¡i colonial Wool and Produco Exchango in Hamburg, tho prospect is still more unsatisfactory. I have known of seven, attempts being made with this view by firms aduuiubly situated tor testing the matter thoroughly, and all huv e failed And tho reason of the failure IB obvmus to till thoso who aro acquuinted with woollen manufacturo. Stun eely a singlo iuctoi y exists for the vvoikmg up of ono description of wool only, and hence buyers prêter u market in which thoy can obtain not only wool from Australia, but from the Capo of Good Ilono and tho East and West Coasts of South America. Were ov erything else as suitable us tho position of Ham- burg and tho admirable arrangements for direct railway communication which exist there, the project would havo a fair prospect of success ; but from the present condition of the trade, there appcui s little ground to hope for an in- crease in tho number of ocean lines bot« een this poit and' Europe.
