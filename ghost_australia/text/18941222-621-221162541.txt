The Christmas that never was — On this foggy wintry air. With clear pale gleam, like the ghost of a dream. It is painted everywhere. The Christmas that might have been It is borne iu the far-off sound, Down the empty Btreet with the tread of feet That lie silent under ground. The Christmas that yet may be. Like the Bethlehem star, leads kind : Yet our life slips past, hour by hour, fast, fast, Few before and many behind. The Christmas we have and hold, With a tremulous, tender suaia, Half joy, half fear— be the psalm of the year, Grief passes, blessings remain !" The Christmas that sure will come, Let us think of at fireside fair — When church bells sound o'er one Email gr. en mound, Which the neighbors pass to prayer. The Christmas that God will give — Long after all these are o'er. When is day nor night, for the Lamb is our Light, And we live for evermore. The Author of " John Halifax.'
