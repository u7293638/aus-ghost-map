The recognition of faithful and good service rendered, coming as it,does to some of them after a lapse of thirty yearsj ,is, it must be confessed, rather' tardy ; still, as the old proverb has it,' better late than never.' Had the Government, how ever, acted less grudgingly iri, the matter— the Premier offering a mild' arid fruitless resistance to ! the resolution proposed by Mr. C. E. Jones, one of the merijbers for Ballarat, and a former Minister of : Railr ways-^the boon would perhaps have been more appreciated by the recipients, and Mr. Gillies have. relieved himself in some degree Ifrbm' the ..charge of political in gratitude which,, even : his warrces't' ad- mirers cannot deny, is justly laid to1 the horiourable gentleman's1 charge. ''' A!s a riiatter of, policy the course [adopted by the headbf the Qpverrimerit was a'blunder, for the 'old members' are ! still a latent power in' the political fTvorld,' and 'will'' assuredly assert theinselves ' ; when .'the 'opportunity comes- in a fashion far from pleasant to the Premier and his colleagues. ???!?? II \ ?. ? ? Of late years the decisions giveri 'by' Courts of Potty Sessions have at ?times caused much irritation and given frequent cause for adverse comment. Yet1 in face of the experiences of the working of these tribunals a bill has passed the Council and been transmitted to the Assembly largely increasing the power of the magistracy— paid and unpaid. Among other things it is provided that on the complaint of any creditor a magistrate may issue an order preventing any person indebted in the sum of ten pounds froin leaving the colony, provided notice of the intended departure shall not have been published in the newspapers notifying such intended departure for a period of three weeks. It is useless to point out how operate. It is to be hoped that the Assembly ?which is supposed to be the House charged jpar excellence with guarding the individual liberty of the people, will interfere' arid place its veto upon a measure under which personal freedom of action can . be so un warrantably dealt with. Should ' the measure be allowed to become law in its \- present form, the credit system will receive its.death blow, and 'cash payinerit' be come the rule, unless if as at present the exception',!'

So the' 'cheap law' — after which a number |of gentlemen in the Assembly affect to yearn —is shelved for this session at all ovents, and Mr. Gaunson must once more be con tent to see his chance of occupying a scat ori the Supremo Court Bench — a contin gency that might have occurred had the Bill passed,— postponed until a more con venient Reason. The picture drawn by one of the oppononts of the amalgamation, of the honourable member for South Mpl bourne, clothed in the judioial scarlet 'and ermine, was too much for the Upper House to contemplate, and perhaps had a large share in sealing the fate of the measure. In the Assembly the storms of the pre? vious week appeared to have cleared the political atmosphere and the House was in a working humour, consequently fair pro gress was made in the business of ? legisla; tion. The consideration of the, es timates, was entered upon and'1 the expenditure in several of ,the[ Government departments agreed to.
