GHOST.-The hamlet of Baynton, near Barfold, in the Kyneton district, has tor some time past been honored-with the, from time to time, appear* ance of a real ghost. Our informant, a stalwart farmer, on whom we con most strictly rely, says the country Eide is in a state of ferment from the re ported appearance of a " horrible shadow, unreal mockery," fairing the outline of a woman with the face of afiend. The place it most affects is near the farm of Mr M'Kenna, and several men have actually left the employ of Mr M'Kenna through terror at the ghostly visitation. Mr'Bennett, a worthy and stoat auctioneer, was so terrified one night, that he turned back and-songht the friendly welcome of an inn, and resolutely refused to go oh till morning; we are told that the ghost addressed the auctioneer,'bat our informant vas not aware if it was in one of the \- dead languages. Tales of iiuuum bones having been ploughed lip upon the farm is an assistance to the ignorant terror die ghost lias 'occasioned. We recommend, as a capital means of exorcising, a good dose.of #mall Bhot, with good aim, directedjto the posterior oevejopmeats of the apparition.' -raffw-1 ' fOWtr 2MM*.
