By Mr. Wisdom: There were two persons with me besides my father-William Haddon and Charles Baker, we were there to prevent Hungerford cutting down my father's fence, I cannot say there was a road there, I believe the Hungerfords had passed through there before with cattle unknown to us, the Hungerfords had only passed through there once to my fathers knowledge, he went to prevent them and stopped them, and gave them permission to go by another track, the Hungerfords said it was a public road, and claimed the right to go through , they claimed it the day they assaulted us, Mr Hungerford had, I believe, used the road several times before the land was fenced in by my father, it was not a very plain road, I believe it had been used by drays, my father fenced it in after he came into possession of Lucan Park, Edmund Hungerford spoke first, he said " We have come lo go through the fence, and we must go through," or words to that effect, I said nothing at all, he had the axe in his hand and went to cut the fence, I went between him and the fence , there was a slip-panel there, my father was standing at the slip-panel, I decline to answer the question as to whether I struck Hungerford, I refuae to answer the question as to whether I struck Mr Hungerford before he struck me, the skirmish lasted I date say about a quarter of an hour, I did not challenge Houligan to fight, he challenged me, after I was knocked down and got up I did not accept the challenge, I chal- lenged William Kirke to fight when he called my father a b-liar, as any son would do if he had any pluck in him, he accepted the challenge, and I fought him, I believe I got the best of it, after I was knocked down and got the kicks I fought with William Kirke, and got the best of him, I could beat two like him, I had not a fight with Edmund Hungerford, no fair fight, I had no fair fight with Houligan, I had not a whip handle, I did not see my father strike Edmund Hungerford, or try to strike anyone, I did not see Edmund Hungerford drop the axe and my father pick it up, I did not see the axe in my fathers hand, after they assaulted us we tried to prevent the cattle going through the slip rails, I and my father went ahead of the cattle, and told them that we im- pounded them, before the cattle came into the pad- dock at all we tiled to prevent them while thev wore holding me down Pirkei, M Donitld, and the boy drove the cattle into the paddock, some were holding me and some holding my father while the cattle were being driven through the only two that I could swear I saw assaulting me were Ed mund Hungerford and Houligan it was during the scuffle my father was coming to assist me, and William Kirke held lum, they after wards went through h fence at the other end of the road , my 1 ithei tried to stop them there, he had a stick in his hand, and said if any one laid his hand on him he would knock him down, Edmund Hungerford laid his 1 ands on my father, and ray fathei then struck him with his fist, after this they cot the cattle through the Â«econd fence - William Ellis deposed I am a glazier residing at Oak Range, about hve miles from Jerry's Plains I own
