Ab has before boon pointed out in tho Star, there waB no means of getting direct from Australia to the Capo until the service was initiated by Messrs. Dalgety and Co. with tho magnificent steamships of the White Star line, and at short intervals a regular lino has been maintained. Two of tho steamships havo been despatched within the past five weeks, and the splendid new 15-knot liner Damnscus will bo the succeeding vessel. That tho ser vice to London by way of South Africa ib appreciated by the public is apparent from the comparatively-, largo number of passengers who avail themselves of tho privilege of travelling by such a mild, smooth water route, theso being altogether apart from those bound to tlio Capo. The Damas cus is most comfortably, not to say luxuriously furnished, whilo the state cabins are largo, lofty, perfectly ventilated, and lighted, and in thia respect Bhe takes high rank among the magnificent steamships per forming Australia's trade with the old world.
