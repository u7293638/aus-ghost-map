THE TWO DREAMERS. Two Irishmen travelling, came to a very poorly supplied inn. . " What can you give us for supper t" said they to the lean and shivering landlord. " I've, naught in the house but one pigeon," replied he ; "so you muBt make the most of it between ye. " All right," replied the shrewder of the two ; " bring up your bird and we'll divide him." The dish was accordingly produced, when Poddy turning tohis companion said, " now Mike, I've been thinking this ghost of a bird won't bear dividing ; what do you say for tossing up for it in this way—we'll go to bed, and to-morrow morning, whoever has had the finest drame shall have the pigeon for his breakfast." The proposal was accepted, and next morning, when the fellow travellers met I'addy took the word and inquired of his companion how he bad slept, and what ho had dreamed. " Bodad I" replied Mike, "and didn't I just drame, and wasn't it a drame that'll bate hollow every other drame that iver was drained. There was I in the very midst of the sivinth heaven, with all the (lowers of glory round me, and clouds of angels and archangels and a bewilderment of saints and patriarchs, all making much of me, and hoisLing me up, and up, and up, till I couldn't go any higher and then I WOKS." " Och, well,"said the other; "its a strange thing } but I had exactly the selfsame drame meself, and I knows what you says thrue, for I saw ye flying up and up, and I FIIVS to meself,' suie, now, Mike's got up us uigli as that he'll never be sich a fool a« to comedown any more,' so 1 got up and «le the pigeon.*
