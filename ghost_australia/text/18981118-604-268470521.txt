AFTER I-iONG 0AV3. After long days of love in loneliness, I move among the ghosts of dead delight. Here where wo kissed good-bye in dumb dis parted and passed into tho gathering night. After long days tho music of her feet Come floating down the old familiar ways; Not all the flutes in Lydia were so sweet, Nor pipes in Arcady; after long days.’ I see her starry eyes, and in her curls The golden sea that beats about her brow, I see the sunbeams Bport like Nereus’ giris I see the glad blood in her cheeks; and now Her soft arms clasp me with a strong caress Her soft lips thrill mo with one tenderest After long days of love in loneliness. Who would not part awhile to meet like this? —“Pall Mall Gazette.”
