BAPTISMAL REGENERATION AGAIN. An anonymous writer -in.our orthodox Church representative,' the Australian Churchman,-. has furnished four articles on baptismal regenera tion- He says "regeneration and the new birth are to be obtained by the infant nto of baptism." In other words, I presume, that baptism and the new birth- are identical. Peter, however, says th.-", we: are -bona again (without mention of baptism) -by si/te;1 Word-of God." (1 Peter i. ) , I ; ;7What: .' proof have a. great / portion ; of . . .the mem bers of the Church of ' England tliatjthey were.ever baptized,, or, if baptized rightly 1 . 77 "A '//'One' of our' clergymeh,1 af p e r vert- . to' (the ;Church\of fRpme) was baptiz'ed;<Arec f«wes,V first in the/ 'Gbngre'gatiorial body, next, ''after 7his ordi iiation 1 in ' the Church ' of - England, 1 and fioally iii the Church of Rome.1 Where 'did he 1 obtain /bis ' regeneration ? /.

' " The Spirit beareth ' witness 'itself : with' our : spirit) that we are 'the children of God;" _ As many as are , led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of -God " (Rom. vin.) Here is'/ ai divine witness far better than any "baptismal register, T/yet:there. is no allusion to baptism in these and numerous other' passages where they have "put off; the old man' with his deeds and have put on the new-./man," &c.; &cl; (Col.- iii.) Nay,r it does not matter whether/ Greek- or' Jew, circioncision or uncircumcision , barbarian,"- Scythian, .bond or free, but Christ is all in alii and, neither nationality nor the rite; of circumcision is -regarded. . The writer appeals /to the .Prayer-book, and what finds /lie." there? r that . persons' are re generated and born again before.; "they, are baptized. The article says; " Baptism is ,a sign and mark of profession also a sign of what ?) regeneration' 'or new . .birth / . . and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost are 'visibly signed - and scaled, r,: Faitli already in ' existence is confirmed - and grace increased ; : not by baptism; U but' » by ..virtue , of prayer to God." ' ' .- And what says .it .of the infant rite— " Is any wise-to bo retained in the Church," not because commanded; but as '.'most agreeable with the institution of Christ?" Further, strange, to say, that we have no: homily on': infant baptism, nay, that the catechism. says it, islnot absolutely necessary, but .generally \ yet new/ birth is in dispensable— ''Yet must bo bornagain. :; Would we notliave expected equally decisive; language as to mfant 'baptism if it .wa3 ail essential.' Ye must be baptized— and:that rightly.. The- infant" baptismal service attributes .the .change, -if any, to prayer, and that the change is effected by the Holy Ghost. ' " Aei ns pray not -the. minister onlv,. but the congregation. " Give /Thy/ Holy Spirit -to this 'infant ; loash and sanctify him < or her with Thy :. Holy Spirit,'? &c.;, &c.; 1 Then he demands in the name of the child from the godfather and godmother, a declaration of faith, the . child; being incapable: ot the 'pre- .reguisiiesj. " repentance and- taith.'-? : Then, and not , till then, - the sign'/ and; seal = - by / water .is visibly applied. " Such-- as be-'liaptized adults must remember- that repentance . and 1 f aith pre- ced( -;.the/>7\externaL-ii.:8ign'.;->.'.thu8r.-iare'.''. infants examined, concerning repenfcance and laith before they are. baptized1 with) water." — Bishop Barker. raThis , is/ a -strange way / df supplying-; thean- icapacity of the infant; but . there "is: -al reserve ;inade/ that tho / child,-, ; w lien ; it / conies'- of .age; is -bqund to -./pertonn these-, promises.1" 'What .evidence- 1 have ( we, .then;" that- -the, child' was actually regenerated in baptism >?< Hie Ghuroh suspends/.its judgment until the child -is capable of botli faith und ropeutauce.: .

They were called "Sly people," " Children. of the- Lord," .Nevertheless branded,! unpardoned, .forgotten of God, "about. to perish." So the wise and foolish virgins stand together as virgins until the Day of Judgment. The kingdom of heaven and of God are ecclesiastical terms distinguish- ing the outward Church of God from the heathen world. What say the homilies on this question ? — " For it is the Holy Spirit and 'no other thing that doth quicken the minds of men ; that which is horn of spirit is spirit." Did not God's Holy Spirit miraculously work in Matthew, &c.; ? Such is the power of the Holy Spirit to regenerate men as to bring them forth anew." — Homily, Whitsunday. In confirmation it is not the Bishop who con firms, but the candidates confirm and ratify the promises made for them. Throughout the ceremony, the pre-requisites of faith and re pentance are required, and these are regenerate before the sign or seal can be applied. Old Latimer with his usual simplicity states the question. Regeneration is not being christened with water aud nothing else. St. Peter says—" We are born notof mortal seed but immortal by .the word of God: thus cb'meth lour new birth." Christ , saith'-T-" You are clean, not for the baptism', you (.w.ere washed . m,.,b'ut for. the tVord's ''sake' . which; I have ; Bpokeh."— Augustine. ' J '."/.(. "J:, //"(./.('(,. : Now/to the Woril, of 'God.' / / In this, baptismal ; regeneration we haye" the., error Peter afeU/into hnd; for which Paul .withstood . him— " .Unless men He circumcized they can't he saived. . Yet what saith . Paul ?— " N either" circumcision iior (uncircurncision av'aileth " anythiiig but a new creature." So in Roin.' ii. 2S, 29 ; and as for baptism, the same apostle says he did not come : to baptize, but to preach the Gospel." (1 Cor. i.) . So onr Saviour did not baptize any ; yet if baptism be regeneration, why did they not ' baptize instead of preach ? Regeneration is attributable in Scripture .to preaching, prayer, the Word of God, &c.;, not confined to any one rite. The apostles went "preaching everywhere, baptizing those that believe. Believe first, baptize afterwards. Attributed to the Word of God. Now you are dean through the Word (not baptism). Again, "Sancfify them through the Truth." Jesus Christ hath begotten you through the Gospel. Born again (how?) by the Word of God" (1 Peter i.). Regeneration is mentioned as distinct from baptism — James i. 28 ; 1 Peter i. 2S ; 1 Cor. vi. ; John L 12, &c.; The Scriptures represent the ineffectuality.of this rite to produce regeneration— Gal. vi. 15;; Phil., iii. 5. ; Rom. ii. 2S, 29. Repentance and faith precede baptism. " These are the fruits of the Spirit" (Acts ii. ; viii. j. J The Scriptures represent the want of faith, not baptism, as the cause of perdition; "He- "that believeth not shall be damned.", So that we have in the Scripture abundant evidences " of various means by which the Holy Spirit works out this change entirely distinct from the initial rite, which, by the emblem of water, -represents purity, and by the divine institution proclaims man dead in trespasses and sins, needing quickening of the Holy Ghost, and further presents to us the triune existence of the Godhead, a grand and beautiful and signifi cant rite, but only a visible sign of regeneration. Let us, in conclusion, examine a few texts that seem to puzzle this teacher. Titus iii. 5 — "The washing of. regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost." Here the apostle does not use the word to baptize, but to wash. Loutron, to wash is frequently used not implying baptism, as in Revelations i. 5 ;' also vii. 14. , . - , : Acts xxii. where the two things are: kept dis tinct— "Arise, be baptized' first,, then wash . away your sins, sanctify; and| . cleanse , your selves." The washing of regeheratiioh Vean'fcbe" regeneration. The one is the' outward visifelb sign, the .other is the inward spiritual grace. Multitudes havebcen baptized outwardly like Simon Magus who was in the -depths of bitter ness and bonds of iniquity.- : ,- ;t ; j Next, John iii. The baptism of Christ had not.been instituted until afterSHio resurrection, 1 therefore He could not censure Nicodemus -for ignorance of that which had not boon-instituted. Nicodemus did hot/although7' a" teacher, understand his own prophets'(Ez'.'jxxxvi.!, &c;: ). Our Saviour first says— " Ye must be born again"' : Seeing the blindness of the man,' lie illustrates the matter by' the symbols of '' water and the 'wind ; but keeps' -perfectly "distinct the natural arid 'the spiritual birtlis.u'! Nicodemus had certainly beeri- circumcised/ but Paul, says— " What, did that" -avail if 'riot' made ;a nbw creature-?"' ; ("(" ("i"'"/"; / Thevery terms used'-'show 'clearly that this change, the 'operation of :the 'Holy1 : Ghost, is more than baptism; " a; new creature " being quickened; " old things "past away/ all things hew," &c.;, &c.; 'A spiritual;existence''is set before us, without' which-' iv'e" bahriot; see;' the Kingdom of Heaven/ The natural man under-/ Btarideth" hot things of ' God ; ' they rmistbe .spiritually discerned. :No'baptisih is mentioned ;here; "'/ '//''; ' .1 would7 conclude with an extract from the Rev. ;E( Parker, vicar of -Stoke, iii his 'two -sermons ' on l;i baptismal regeneration;'— "The -dogma 'is 'unmerciful, (delusive immoralunr ; /morcifufasd'oqmiug ''millioustp eternal, p'erdif ' ;tioii/''bo'rn Svh'efe' the 'sacrament ' cannot' b had ; 'cteislvih'asniuch 'as' it'teache'tb that there" is ho ' either" in ' tb e" ; Sirri ptu'res; the /articles/ ??!!i®'5 of "the, ChurcK'bf England' /immoral " because''' phh - thereby7 are" tauglit.
