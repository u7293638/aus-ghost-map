Then they came to his parents' house and found that his ]i;ir< : nts and brothers and sisters were- in want. They did not wish to see him though. He was then taken to see the y»nii« woman whose life he had blighted. Slie made no effort to speak to hiin. They next went to the tavern and saw ills old companions. Instead of greeting i.im they passed him by as if they loathed lnin. The ghost then took "him by the ; ! 'l and said "Come, I will show you iiKit tiue love is better than g'lld."

The then lea him to a strange place and .iiis'tiGd, biit another ghost came on the scene, which was horrible to look at. This ghost informed. Scrouge that he-had ci.me for him. He saw men walking about, and could hear them talking. One man a^id, "So old Squeeze-em-Light is dead ; well, he's no logs." Another wondered what would become of bis money. Another said, "Oh, there will be a general scramble." He has nephew »t YVhitechapel, who will get it. Well, said another his money has not done him any ijood. The ghost then took him to his liouss where he saw strangers removing his furniture, and a woman taking ("iowji the window blinds. He asked her whiit ri &ht; she had there. She took no notice. He stood in the doorway to prevent her from carrying out a large bundle, but she simply passed through him with the bundle. (Laughter - ) Others were attending to his business. His sigp.bcaid was taken down before his • yes. At last a coffin was brought, and lis was laid in it. A- funeral procession shortly after left his house and entered a cemetery. He saw an open grave, and \ the Collin lowered. The name on the breastplate was his own. The grave was tilled in and the ghost disappeared. Scrouge opened his eyes and found himself clutching the bedpost (Laughter.) He got out of bed and threw up hie j window. It was a glorious morning and the church bells were chiming. He saw a boy passing by and called out, " I Bay, j boy, what day is this?" "ChristmasDay/ j said the boy. fe'erouge sent the boy off to the poulterer ' with ... a message to •» take . his prize turkey round to Bob Cratchet, addressed to Tiny Tim.

His reason was, he Er r 'di because the babies had a sour smell bout them. (Roars of laughter.) He ext found out the gentlemen with the subscription list, and surprised them by 'landing them a handsome donation. He then went to his office and waited for Bob Cratchet, It was ah hoar behind tilllt Bob arrived, and he went about his work as if he was going to overtake 0 o'clock. Presently Scrouge called Bob up to him, as he wanted to know why be was so late. Poor Bob treiubliugly saj. said that some kind friend had sent Tiny Tim a turkey for his Clrtistmas dinuer, and they had stayed up rather late last night by way of honbgring the event.
