THE MARYBOROUGH HANDICAPS. 1 Tlio weights for thoso events wore recoived'on Monday night by telegram as follows : — Publi- can's Purso, 2 inilos — Wanderor, 8at. 121bs. ; Gliioftain, 8st. lOlbs. ; Mistake, 7st. 91bs. Jockoy Club Handicap, noarly 2 miles and three quarters— Wanderor, 8st. lOlbs. ; Chioftain, 8st. lOlbs. ; Fishhook, 8st. ; Mistake, 7st. 71bs. ; Highland Mary, (ist. 81bs. If tlio Maryborough Handicappova had hoard tho remarks which were biade on their work they would not liavo folt flattefod, I tim.sure. Up hero thoro is but who ^'opinion, and it is that Mistake has been literally thrown in for both raeos ; and that, barring, accidents, lib will win them oasily. This horso should have had at least oight or nine pounds more than lias been allotted him. On tho first ;day of the Toowoomba races, in the Stewards' Gup; distance ljt inilos, Mistake (who, up to the altering of the date of meeting, was a favourite for the riice) was weighted at 8st., giving Wan derer, and Erin 71bs.. each. He was defeated by. the former,- but finished in front of the latter. Ho won the Grand Stand Stakes, a weightfpr agp rape, on the socond day, beating Viceroy ; and in the Forced Handicap his weight was fixed by,i the Toowoomba Haiulicappors at 8st., and :^Yicprpy's (who did not accept) at ,7s t. lOlbs. At ,,\Varwiok, oii the first day, Erin finishod iui' front. b£ . -Wanderer, giving him 21bs ; ...but on' the sqcoiicLday tho latter, at even weights, rovorsed the, verdict of the . previous day. At tho same meeting, in iho Consolation Handicap, Viceroy, 7st. 121bSi, inbt Erin, 8st. 2lbs. ; and beat him easily. ' Then at Dalby, Erin, carrying the i Bailie weight as Wandoror, won both handicaps. -Nb,w,\tlicso.iiKuros.;provo-that at ovon woights there is very littlo to chose between Erin and ?Wanderer, and that at Warwick Erin was unable ,togivo4ros. to Viceroy. Thoy also show that Mistake is several pounds a better horse than Erin and Vicoroy. But tho truest index as to Mr. Nolan's horso is tho Toowoomba Forced Handicap, in which he was only weighted a stone below Zanco (who has always defeated Wanderer and Erin at a diftbronce of from 14 to 18 pounds) and yet Zanco would not accept. Mistako was third, beating Eucalyptus, giving him 24 lbs. At Warwick, Eucalyptus boatErinand Wandorer, receiving only Gibs, from each. How, there of orb, .the Maryborough Solons havo como to 'riiak' e but that Wandorer and Chieftain are 171bs. and 151bs. superior animals to Mistake is per fectly inexplicable. In'tho Forced Handicap, at Gympio, Vicoroy certainly- was asked to concbde lllbs.! to. Mistako, and what was the result1! The ' big chesnut with all his '.fine spood never had the ghost of a show for the race. Stillbett'er proof of Mistake's capabilities is tho 'fact; that in ?' tlie 'same race Fishhook was weighted at 8st.' 211)'b, .'thre'e;ipb\iuds less, than Mistako', aiid'yet' Mr. :Nbltoii'prefbrre,d'''tol'nc6opt':'with'/tWib'ay hofso.
