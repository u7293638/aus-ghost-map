LOTE PASSED BY. I was busy with my. ploughing When love passed by. "Come," she cried, "forsakethy drudging, Life's delights are few and grudging; What hath man of all his striving, All bis planning and contiiving, Here beneath the sky ? When the grave opes to receive him Wealth and wit and honors leave him— Love endures for aye!" But I answered—" I am ploughing, When with straight and even furrow All the field is covered thorough I will follow." 1 Love passed by. I was busy with my sowing When Love passed by, " Come," she cried, " give o'er thy toiling, For thy toil thou has but moiling; Follow me where meadows fertile Bloom unsown with rose and myrtle, Laughing to thesky; Laugh for joy the thousand flowers, Birds and brooks—the laughing hours All unnoted fly." But I answered, " I am sowing, When my acres all are planted Gladly to the realm enchanted I will follow." Love passed by. I was busy with my reaping When Love passed by. " Come," she cried, " thou plantest grieving, Bipened sorrows art thou sheaving. If the hefLrt lie hollow, vain is Garnered store. Thy wealth of grain is Less than Love's least sigh. Haste thee—for the hours fast dwindle Ere the pyre of hope shall kindle In life's western sky." But I answered—" I ate reaping. When, with song of youth and maiden, Home the farm-cart comes full laden, I will follow." Love passed by. I had gathered in. my harvest When Love passed by. " Stay! " I called to her, swift speeding, Turning not, my cry unheeding. " Stay, O Love, I fain would follow; Stay thy flight, O fleet-winged swallow, Cleaving twilight sky! I am old and worn and weary. Yoid my fields and heart—and dreary. With thee I would fly. Garnered woe is all my harvest, Sad ghosts of my dead hopes haunt ine. Fierce regrets, like demons, taunt me— I foUow." Love passed by. -Amusing Journal.
