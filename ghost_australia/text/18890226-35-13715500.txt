FREE TRADE FALLING, AND THE REASON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-During the temporary cessation of hostilities which now obtains, outside the House at least some little good may come of pointing out the injustice in various directions which freetrader s hay of rendered their cause responsible for As a fool of the freetraders, hut a nevertheless as a lover of fair pin), 1 <. yy that of free trade is not fighting a fair fight on its merits, but is staggering under a barbarous handicap-is dragged down to the dust by the demands of its officers and allies In truth I am not so sure that the battle it between freetraders and protectionists That they occupy a portion of the field, and are at each other's throats cannot he denied but the big fight appears to me to be between the country and the metropolitan parties Both sides are, of course, followed by foreign factions and fanatics There is, however, no difficulty about pi circling what the end will be M en, no matter how bigoted, will not fight long for a flag, fad, or principle when the) and, and myself found, their gins levelled at their own homes The yellow fing too, is fading fast in the interior and bonny-blue streaks are making their appearance in it everywhere, and so rapidly that, if to-morrow another appeal to the people were made the so-called free trade, but in reality Sydney party, would go down still further Nor is this to be wondered at when the treatment which the interior has received at the hands of this party is inquired into only a little Our principal producers, the Crown tenants, can no longer carry the burden which has been placed upon them by it The sights that my own have witnessed during my recent tour through this electorate are beyond belief I disbelieve that Mr Dillon M P , can bring OUR takes more hearts time, even from Ireland One in particular that of the Richardson, of Merrygoen, eclipses any thing ever heard of, and wants the immediate consideration of a Government possessed of practical knowledge enough to believe and comprehend the case lins family one of the most thrifty, industrious, and sober in the colony-is, after 38 years, toiling and scraping, forced off their holding, compelled to abandon it, and all the improvements they have put upon it for the simple reason that they cannot pay the rent demanded by the Crown, and lest it be not bad enough to lose their 38 years labour, her Majesty has served them with a writ which the whole balance of their possessions down to their bedding would be insufficient to satisfy 1 could cite other cases almost as bad but the Richardsons are the only people who gave me full permission to publish then ensure the world Mr Abbotproposedtomsortaclaiiso no Land Bill brought down to the House by Mr Garrett, which would have met such cases as this would have given such unfortunate people as the Richardsons the right to appeal to a disinterested tribunal against the rent fixed by a Minister who did not know what he was doing, and how was this fair and honest proposal received a Mr Garrett said he would throw up the bill rather than accept it Sir Henry Parkes condemned it as an invasion upon the sacred rights of our cherished institutions, as a thing never before heard of, as an outrage upon Parliamentary government calculated to call down the ghost of Wentworth to the floor of the House to frighten the fools who dared ask for it A greater display of ignorance no two men at one time were over guilty of the Land Tax Bill and Railway Act, which lay upon the table of the House, and which were supposed to have emanated from Sir Henry himself, contained clauses almost identical with that suggested by Mr Abbott, whilst the 23rd clause of the Land At of 1861 (for which by the way, Sir Henry had voted), went even further than Mr. Abbott's amendment I his, and much more, I am) self pointed out to the House, and what was its answer? Forty-seven so called freetraders voted against this amendment again! giving to their follow men, whose all was in the land and who could not leave it a fair trial Why, the British Government forced itself in between the private land owner and his tenant, and gave to the latter the very thing asked for by Mr Abbott And w he supported Mr Abbott's motion, who supported Mr. M'Millan's motion challenging Mr Garrett's right to raise rents above the amount recommended by the land boards, and who entered their protest against taxing the sel ctois'unpud balances not the ' freetraders," but the other fellows who spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in and around the city on questionable undertakings whilst people in the interior had to Ino without bread because of the impassable condition of public roads? Again, I repeat that it was not freetraders (I disbelieve that there are a dozen true disciples of this doctrine in the House), but it was the Sydney party, the job mongers and los rollers of the city and suburbs who were responsible for these in- justices Alas, for free Made it is in bad company, and must go under sooner or later not so much because of its own faults us by reason of the sins of its allies In a recent leading article you point out that Sydney and suburbs are almost unanimously in favour of a freetrade policy, that the), if they had their nests, possess nearly two fifths of the whole voting of the colony) Surely no sane man wishes to see Sydney govern the whole colony. the colony could live without Sydney, but Sydney could not live without the colony As matters stand the city is far too strongly reprobated Add to the to members it itself returns those city men who represent court and send - suburban constituencies and you will find that it has somewhere nbout70niembirsalwa>scomentablo always on the spot if required, whilst not more than 60 per cent of our country representatives are ever present. The proto tionists must go down once or twicomoroon this very account Sydney in truth, is not the proper site for the seat of Government that is, if we desire fair government Admitting, however, that Sydney and suburbs peRsons two-fifths of the voting power of the colony, and that it is to a man freetraders, it can afford to make war on the rest of the colony, and this, in downright reality, is what it has done, and what it will be punished for doing It seems to me that you are in error in assert- ing that the people within the metropolitan district con- tributed as much per head to the revenue as the people outside The net receipts of our Lands Department alone, 1887 to 1888, reached £1 300,000, whilst its not in transactions reached £3,0,000 (about). How much of this money was paid by the unemployed or indeed, by city and suburban people ." On whom should the latter depend for the very bread they eat? On the interior-on the producer true is it how ever that they do not say in a measure do so, and how then do they live ' They live by carrying the securities which are the property of the producer to London and raising money upon them, which they dole out amongst themselves What other interpretation will the building of those SO locomotive engines, the money squandered on the Prospect water a) stem, and 60 other undertakings, admit of? Who will be called upon to pay the interest on this money ? Will it be the people who live in and around Sydney, or those who are in occupation of productive land ? If the former, where are they toobtainit from a Ihoyare supply middle men, and must look to the producer for everything when the money-lender finds there The country is rapidly awakening to a truer sense of its position, or the position which the Sydney party is placing it in and freetraders, though the pastoralists and thousands of other inland people may be in their hearts self protective, will force them to become and Sydneyites.
