CHDECH IN THE CATACOMBS. Bev. G. Haworth, lecturing in Black burn, Eng., on "The Primitive Church in the Catacombs of Some," traced the histo of the early Christiana from the introduction of the Gospel by those who had been to the ' feast at Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost was poured on the waiting church, to the time of Constan tino, giving an account of the persecu tions under the Emperor Claudius, and of believers seeking refuge in the cata combs. The lecture was illustrated by a number of diagrams of the cata combs and inscriptions from many of the tombs, from which he pointed out that these early followers of the Lord had i no prayers for the dead, and the Latin cross was not used by them. He showed that they held the faith in the simplicity of the Gospel, and that they walked by faith and not by sight, dying " in peace," and in the full assurance of salvation through the merits of Christ. All history shows that the original phristian church was entirely free from idolatry. "When in 1413 three popes were fight ing for mastery the celebrated Synod of Constance met and declared as follows : " This holy Synod of Constance being a general council legitimately assembled in the Holy Ghost to the praise of Almighty God, for the extirpation of the present schism and the union and refor mation of the Church of God, ordains, refines, enacts, decrees and declares as follows. And in the first place it declares that itself being legitimately assembled in the Holy Ghost, being a General Council, and representing the Catholic Church militant, has its power imme diately from Christ, to the which power every person of whatsoever state of dignity, even Papal, is bound to be obedient in those things which pertain to faith, to the extirpation of the said schism, and to the general reformation of the Church of God in its head as well as in its members." From this it will he seen that the synod did not acknowledge Papal infallibility or the supremacy of the popes of Home.
