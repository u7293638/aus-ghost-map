XHOW SHALL WE DECIDE, THIS QUESTION '' \-- Now, whichis the:worse-to have no, appetite for your dinner, or to have no, dinner for your appe tite ? There-are lots of people on the one side of the question.. When " good digestion waits on appe tite.and healnh on both," that is the ideal attitude of a person towards his meals. But most. of us are not blessed in that way; we either have too much food without an appetite, or a vigorous appetite without enough to satisfy it-- Different folk. will answer this question differentry;,yet: the common sense otit-is that, within. reasonable limits, it is: beetter-. have -apeetite witho y jil: h-trii a mS livhdb ought/.to andi doesn't feel li Seating ,.itands. infe of alteration aireepairs" ; To'illuetrate We recently received a comtmun cationin which the writer. says,.

What he meansiby trhe fear of '" something going to happen" is, of course, the fear of some Calamity, sech as the loss of his position, his own( ' death, ori the death of somebody dear to himu. Thiswas. due, as he intimates, to.the impoverished-state: of his blood (the life bearer), his unst g nerves;: and. to the bratn enfeebled by lack of nourishment.

There is a countless multitude who are all the while goingthrough the same wretched experience, only we don't happen to come in touch with. them. Well, the- writer finally mentians: that after all medical treatment had left him where it fonnd him he chanced to read ins.hook of a case exactly like his own having been cured by Mother Seigel's: Syrup. " My wife," he says, " got me a bottle at Mr Lanstaff's, in Woodleford, and after using its contents the ailmnent left me and has never returned since that fortunate day. I should like the whole! world to know what it did for me. I have been employed by the Midland Railway Company for eleven.years. (Signed) .
