TEE CASE OF JOHN KIDD. TO THE EDITOB. Sir,-Will you kindly correct the error that has been made in connection with the sad death of my husband, John E. Kidd, who died at the Perth Public Hospital and not at the gaol, as your representative in- formed the public. His being detained at the lockup 11 hours at least after being found and then removed, destroyed any ghost of a chance he had of living. How the police did not sooner find out that they had made an error in locking him up in- stead of taking him to the hospital I cannot understand. At this great distance I have been unable to get any details but from your paper, but my own personal knowledge is sufficient to inform me of the symptoms of skull fracture. By inserting this in your valuable paper, you will much oblige. -Yours, etc., J. R. KIDD. Broad Arrow, July 9.
