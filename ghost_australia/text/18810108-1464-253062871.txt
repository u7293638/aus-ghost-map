« Books, &c.;, Received. The Australian, Christmas Number. — A special number has been brought out at this gay and festive season by the enterprising pro prietor of the Australian. There are many papers suitable to the season which will afford much pleasure in the reading. Of these are particularly to be mentioned " Ghost Stories," by a Husband and Wife; "Tommys Christmas;" the " Vampire Bace, " by Australie, a well constructed tragic poem ; and "Flummery and the Fairies," by F. Myers. It will be found a very agreeable Christmas and New Year's companion. The Way we Civilise. — We have received a copy of a pamphlet containing articles reprinted from the Queenslander upon the treat ment of native blacks by the settlers and the Native Police, entitled " Black and White." These will be read with much interest, dis closing as they do the atrocities to which the unfortunate natives are subjected. | Melbourne Punch. — The Christmas number of our comic brother has been received. It is a highly creditable production, and fully sustains the prestige it has already gained. The pictures in the Christmas number are well coloured lithographs, very artistically drawn. Sands' Diary. — This useful little companion is again to hand. None should be without a copy. !
