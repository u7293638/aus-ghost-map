THE LAND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE. BY GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA. IX.—MELBOURNE TO ADELAIDE. So farewell Melbourne the Marvellous, city of towering warehouses, Parliament Houses —the new one as yet unfinished—law courts, free libraries, a colossal post- office, a monumental town-hall, col- leges, institutes, cathedrals, churches and chapels innumerable, stately Government offices, multitudinous drinking bars — of which the sprightly barmaids are threatened with extinction under the clauses of Mr. Berry's new Licensing Bill. Farewell Melbourne, city of handsome, elegant and well- patronised theatres. The Australians in general are deliriously fond of "variety shows. " They like opera bouffe well enough, They will patronise a highly spiced sensa tional melodrama of the "World" or "In the Ranks" type; but they dote on circuses, and regard the buffooneries of a nigger enter tainment as sweet morsels to be rolled beneath the tongue. And Shakespeare! Well, such tragedians as Charles Kean, Gustavus V. Brooke, Barry Sullivan, Thomas Creswick, and Walter Montgomery-the effigy of the last named gentleman as Hamlet is to be found in all the Australian wax-work exhibitions-have gathered both fame and money in the Southern Hemisphere; but that was in days gone by. What the present generation of Australians would say to Shakspeare without a star actor or actress of the very first water in the leading cha racters, I am sure that I do not know. On tlie other hand, thousands who knew not a word of Tuscan-rushed to hear Ristori, and thousands more unfamiliar even with the French of Stratford atte Bowe, would rush to hear Sarah Bernhardt. Farewell, then, Melbourne, city of clubs that are solemn, and clubs that are sprightly, but all overflowing with thoughtful courtesy and generous hospitality all ready to be extended-from the puissant Melbourne Club, the resort of the proudest merchants and bankers and the most patrician squatters, to the genial Yorick, the chosen haunt of the wits and scholars of Melbourne -to the wanderer from afar. Fare- well, cheery and fraternal Masonic club, farewell, "Mutual Imps" although circum stances over which I had no control pre vented me from participating inyourinno cent diablerie, farewell to all the doctors, und especially farewell to all the Brobding pagian banks in Collins street I cannot help it I have been mildly accused by friends in this country of having "bank on the brain, ' and such, perhaps, may be the case But, I repeat, I can not help it When you first visit Venice, do not the palaces on the Grand Canal take your breath away ? At Pisa are you not continually haunted by the Lean ing Tower? At Moscow is not the image of the Kremlin ever before you? ln Australia generally, and in Melbourue in particular, it is the banks that haunt you, and subdue your sense to one absorbing feeling of wonder and reverence for the power of Mammon. The Bank of Australasia, a massive pile of the Doric order, the London Chartered Bank in the Greco Italian style, the Bank of Victoria, the Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia how many more banks there may be in Collins street I am incompetent to tell, for these palaces of finance, now of marble now of bluestone, now of Kangaroo Point stone, beset me on every side. Lombard street, Lothbur}, King William street, London, E C -they must all hide their diminished heads before the banks of Collins street, Melbourne The Colonna and the Orsini, the Frangi panni and the Savelli, the Dona and the Odescalchi, built no doubt very grand palaces at Rome. There are some very sumptuous palaces, too, at Florence and at Genoa, but these big buildings do not mean money. The banking palaces of Melbourne do. They are so many cash castles. They smell of riches. As you pass, it seems as though you heard the fingering by deft tellers of the crisp bank notes within-a sound, to money loving ears, more musical than the rustling of Frou frou s robe of silk, tilt you remember that the certi ficates of indebtedness, payable on demand, of the Australian banks are not always crisp lndeed they become, in the remote " back blocks," after much bandying to and fro among squatters, "free selectors," drovers, publicans, and storekeepers, very soft, greas), and dirty indeed But the} are alwa}a Hvveet to look upon. Farewell notes of the Brobdiugnagian Melbourne banks I must not, in worldly wisdom, take any of you to Adeluide, for in the neighbour mg colouy of South Australia the paper currency of Victoria and other colo mes can only be cashed subject to a dis count of sixpence in the pound I shall find another custom house too, at Adelaide, another tariff, and another postage stamp and the I cderation I nabling Bill has just passed through the Imperial Parliament. I wonder how many wiseacres there are at home who are cherishing the illusion that the Australian colonies intend, in red hot haste, to federate thoroughly and effectively, as the United States have federated Meanwhile, farewell Melbourne-until, at least, I return to survey thy marvels again, includinz thy by butchers' shops, thy brilliant suburbs, thy crowded omm buses, thy splendid Botanical Garden, thy 0 remarkable Waxworks, and Mr Coles book arcade in Bourke street. A big steamer awaits me at the wharf, and I am bound for Adelaide. The passage from Melbourne to the sea is -I am afraid to the chuckling delight of the worthy people of Svdney-neither facile nor dignified It might not be so very calummous to call the waterway from the astound mg metropolis of Victoria to Williamstown " right mean. ' That is an American Iocu tion, but it is expressive, with tolerable terseness, ot the general aspect of the River Yarra Yarra. Did not Richard Cobden once place on contemptuous record the fact that he had cleared, at a single bound, one of the moat famous of the classical rivers of Attica ' I should say that an Old Man kangaroo of ordinary capacity might be warranted to clear the Yarra Yarra, at Melbourne, in a couple of hops. But what the stream lacks in breadth it makes up form depth , for the steamer which is to convey me to the fair city of Adelaide ia a mighty ship, and she, with craft as huge, comes right up to Melbourne wharf. On the other hand, the immense steam galleons of the Peninsular and Oriental, the Orient, and the French Messageries Man times lines come no nearer Melbourne than Williamstown, which is at the south point of the estuary of the Yarra, on the south west shore of Hobson's Bay, and distant some eight miles from Melbourne, w lth winch it is con nected by railway Opposite Williams town, on the other side of the bay, is Sandridge, now called Port Melbourne, which is at only two miles and a half by rail from the city. The Sydney people, justifiably proud of their enchanting harbour, do not fail to rub their hands with glee- figuratively speaking--when they recall the exiguity of the Yarra, while the peaceful inhabitants of the smiling shores of Corio Bay, the extensive west arm of Port Phillip, are never tired of telling you that, if all towns had their rights and justice were done where justice was due the metropolis of Victoria would not be at Melbourne at all, but at Geelong I have been to Geelong and like it much Including its outlying suburbs, it may have, at the present time, a population of twenty thousand It will have a popula tion of fifty or a hundred thousand some of these days--say when its local manufactures have been fully developed, when the transcon t mentally railway is built, and coolie labour, or some other labour is brought in to render fruitful the almost unparalleled resources of this vast and comparatively speaking un inhabited continent. Then there will be plenty of mechanics and labourers and domestic servants obtainable for moderate wages. Then good cooks will abound and your wealthy friends will be able to ask you to dinner at their own houses then there will be a little less cricket and football a little less racing and rowing, and a little more culture of art and letters, and then there will be the millennium, and the banks will all gratify their shareholders with a dividend of a thou- sand per cent, per annum Alnascbar, itinerant dealer in glass and crockery ware, yon are dreaming again over your basket But Geelong on the pleasant shores of Corio Bay, is certainly somewhat of a dreamy place. The steamer Adelaide is a noble vessel, well built--at Glasgow And, of course, one may almost say-well manned, well found, and well appointed, in every way. In Caploin Lockyer she has a gallant and efficient com mander. Likewise are her saloons and state rooms illuminated by the electric light. The Adelaide is also excellently well ventilated, and her tween decks must be in summer time deliciously cool the dining saloon is far down below, with a lofty coved glazed ceiling , and here, in the scorching months of January and lebrunr), the atmosphere must bo BO deh"httully tempered ns to render punkahs and wind sails al! but unnecessary accessories to v entilation Y es, ber saloon, prettily painted, nnd decorated with panels of fancy wood», curiously minni and bril- liantly polished, with her airy little smoking room, with its tesselated flooring, displaying the motto "Advance Australia," and the antipodean heraldic devices of the emu, the kangaroo, and the golden fleece we shall have aii Australian King of Arms some of these days, and "loison Boy" should be his title I-with her well fitted bathrooms, her pianoforte, and the canaries warbling in their cages high up in the cove above the saloon table- the Adelaide is altogether a Bummer ship, and a delightful one in which "spend the 40 hoursor som which, when the weather ia fair, the sea I trip irom Melbourne to Adelaide should be [ accomplished But the railway between the I capitals of Victoria and South Australia is | being actively pushed forward, and ere long, i it is to be hoped, there will be uninterrupted railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and ultimately Bris bone and Northern Queensland At present it can scarcely fail to strike the traveller from home that, ludicrously ignorant as vast numbers o£ 1-nghsh people nre of tilings Australian, the colonists themselves do not know nearly so much about one another as they should do lhe) are too far apart socially speaking They hove too few in- terests m common, at least, they erroneously imagine that the) hav e too few The great Australian newspapers publish daily a few snapp) télégraphie items of intelligence, and a Melbourne journal bas its periodical Adelaide letter, a Sydney paper ita periodical Brisbane one, and a Hobart paper its Sydney or Melbourne one, and vue icrsa all round, and still. Bave at the clubs and at the mechanics institutes and schools of arts libraries, there seems to be only a very slight exchange of intercolonial journalism , and the politics, the social economy, the literary, and artistic progress of one colony appear to excite only a very languid amount of interest in the others. I can well reinem ber when a similar condition of nnathetic indiflerence among sister colonies existed in the British possessions *m North America. Montreal knew nothing or pro fessed to know nothing, about Quebec, while Toronto expressed protound contempt tor the " two Trench towns as the go a head western city disdainfully dubbed the capitula of Lower Canada As for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, the Canadians were socially and politically unani mous in agreeing that the colonies inhabited by the "Mue Noses ' were not worth talking about, or thinking about, at all I was m Canada when the scheme of federation was being hotly and acrimo ntously discussed, and in many instances held up in unmeasured terms to obloquy and ridicule as a wholly impracticable and illusory idea *Yet the Dominion of Canada has been for a considerable number ot ) ears an accomplished fact. Of whether thatmagni (¡cent lederation is a success or the contrary the Canadians should be the best judges As for Australian federation, the plan for making it a reality is as yet m a v ery shadowy and nebulous condition. When it is to come and in what form-its latest phase of discus sion being a " chippy, ' half querulous corre spondeiice between Mr Service, the Premier of Victoria, and Sir Alexander Stuart, the Premier of New South Wales- how am I, a stranger and a novice in the land, to tell ? 1 he gentlemen who live at home at ease m Lngland, who have never visited the Aus trahan colonies, or, having v ísited them, havo merely scampered through the land, sojourn ing it may be, just 40 hours in one capital and SO hours m another, have quite made up their minda on the aubject of federation, Imperial and intercolonial I can only voucb for the things vv Inch I have seen, and argue from experience of other lands In unfede rated Australia there seems to be too w ide a gulf between each colony. They aro all justi fiably proud of their relations to Lngland, but they arc not, so it strikes me, sufficiently proud of their relations to each other Be ¡ond the droll jealousy which is said to exist between the two magnificent cities of Sydney and Melbourne-the New South Welshmen declare that it is the Melbournmns who are jealous of Sydney, while tlie Victorians as vehemently assert that it is the New South Welshmen who are jealous of Melbourne there w ould not appear to be the slightest reason for any nvalrj, Bave one of the most amicable nature among this beauteous band of colonial sisters. But that such a rivalry -taking, as it very frequently docs, the form of cross grained disparage ment- does, to a certain degree, exist in the Australian colonies seems to me palpable Still, one need not be n fanatical believer in nostrums, political, social, and otherwise Federdotion moy not prove n "cure all ' Tederated Columbia is not exempt from in ter state and inter civic rivalries of the dis parnging kind. Chronic jealousy, quite IIB comical as that which is said to exist-mind / do not say that it does exist-between Sydnej nnd Melbourne, has long prevailed between Boston and New Y ork and between Chicago and St. Louis , while, complacently impartial, California derides the whole of the communities on the other side of the liocky Mountains ns " those eastern folk,' It is the way of the world and oi human nature. Perhaps Bath does not think so much of Cheltenham, or Scarborough of cither Edinburgh may love Glasgow only as a step sister, and Liverpool inny secretly think Manchester a vastly overrated town. The rivalry between Dover and rblkestone is as old as the Saxon Heptarchy, and many cen tunes have pissed since the people of Dover have claimed intellectual supremacy, hotly contested by thetr rivals, over the people o£ < Folkestone '1 he claim in question does not appear to have any basis moro substantial than tho tradition that the body of adrowned man was, once upon a time, vv ashed on shore between Dover and rollteatonc On one of the iinc,cra of the corpse there was a diamond ring 'Hun for a knife I cried the Dover people The simple minded Polkcstoniana ran for a knife, but ere they returned the astute Dov enana had bitten oft* the dead mau s finger, diamond ring and al) Should a Bimilnrly grim contingency arise on the Pacihe shore, I wonder whether S)dney or Melbourne would get tlie best of it Among tlie things which the "ft ise Man of old declared to be utterly incomprehensible to him was the way of a ship on the sea.
