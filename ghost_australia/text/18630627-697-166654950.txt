Thkix days from tho time when Edward Scott took his Ji nvc of iho crowd of young fellows congregated on the pnacock in iiont of Dulh House, a party of nineteen cava liers weir to be scon issuing from the scrubby flat which lay between Blackaddcr Widgc oud tho Glengarry River, making for the lord up by Macarthy'fl, and thou striking due Miuth townrcR the endless plains and marshes which lay in Ihut direction. 1 *H trim flm tim-fv ?Tnmirt.fr ntiwlifimi fnr th/* ro'orftrv I of tho lost daughuV of Lanky Jim, nnd consisted!, first of oil of EfWiu\1 Seutl, the lender.' of Tom and Charley Payne, Mut Bclnnry, Jnek Jvomie.^y, Dick Joyce, and a number of other young mm from ell parts of tho count ranging from the Bongong Plains to tho West, to the rolling downs beyond fhe lielJowir tip to the northward, including also a young English tmveller who lind, with the restlesn craving ior ndventnie wlmh characterises tliat uneasy nation, wan dered cown to see wlint will one day bo considered as wonCers of the world, when tourists, anxious tor fresh worlds to conquer, t-hull hold tho llhiue and Mont 13Janc os tliey do now u ehwip trip from London to North Wales, there and hack for a guijiea, and shall come fo visit tho sublime scenery of tho Australian Alps (cheap trips, per haps ; who knows ?) wondered down to see the wonders of which ho had heard dim aud vaguo reports from stookmcn and ovcrhindcrs, the wild and fearfully grand mountain gorge, north of Lake Onico, tho Murray Gates, where the infant river babbles and sploshes between the walls of its granite prison, that hong darkly and frowiungly three tlioutanuj i'cet overhead ; the volcanic caves tliat yawn in Ihe gullies of the Western ranges, and stretch, if one may judge by tlio dull hollow echo of horses' hoofs, forsooj'es, ay, hundreds of miles underground ; aud the sprealing lakes and wide plains, where all the birds, beasts, and fishes : of Australia may be found, and where botanists may revel to their heart's content. He had an introduction lo Major Macaithy, at the head of tlie Glengarry, and hearing of tlie expedition, had moved heaven nnd earth lo be allowed to join it. There were also tho iuli complement of six govern ment men, who had rcccived the promise of a free pardon on condition of tho search proving; successful, and in whose charge, (under the supervision of a sergeant of police, who had been spared by Captain Shea,) fhe pack horses, currying two months' provisions, wero placed. After leaving the Glengarry the parly struck across a wide plain overgrown wilh thick tea-tree scrub and stunted timber, duo South, making for a distant range of low hills which bounded the view in that direction, and which was the furthest to where the foot of the win to man had penetrated, unless it wero some solitiuy stockman in search of stray cattle, or the out lawed bushranger, who had flod from the avenging arm of his fellow men, and sought to dwell, for a time, iu the IracHess wilds frequented only by the omuani the kangaroo. It wus a wild and savage country, peopled onlv by tribes of ferocious blacks of, or kindred to, the Warngal tribo, and consisting of extensive san^y flais, sinking to the Eastward into reecy and miasmie swamps, nnd rising on the west info well-wooded ranges, above which peered the line of the fist nut Alps, broken into a thousand fantnsti'; icy pea^s. The sun was sinking behind the Buffalo Mountain before they had reached the foot of the low lying rises, and find ing a frhellerod hollow behind a rocky fcnoiJ, where a small creek of clear water trickled along its stony bed, they campcd ibr the night. The sky was overspread with dim hnze, pollen ilug heat, tiirough which fhe gorgeous crimson streaks shone Ih.o burs of Ihe across the leaden tinnament, and the golden glory of the rotting sun shot from the btnrply dctlnc'' masses of mountain, beliind which he sank gradually lower mid lower, while lying low upon the eastern horizon, and floating in tho white ocean mist, were bunked up iu tumbled heaps, masses of heavy black clouds. The horses were hobbled and turned loose fo feed upon the ginss which here and there grow ruiikly on the border of the creek ; the tires were lighted, and us the evening gloomed into night, and tho thin narrow crescent of the moon appeared, dim forms were seen lounging ou the sw.'ud, smoking, chatting, and speculating on the move ments of the monw- One by one did they roll themselves up in then- blankets and pillowed on the stuffing of thoir saddles, seek iho sweet s'.i ep which steals over the weary liavelier, sifter a day's ride, and a supper of damper, mutton, and tea, find over the sleeping camp the polo stars ? Vfpt watch and ward, shining through the lcaty screen, which scarcely moved by the soft breeze from tho sea, mur mured a soothing lullaby to the hardy men beneath. Not 1 a t-ouud, save the dull and indefinable hum of nature busy 1 at her handywork, the deeply druun breaths of the sleepjj-s, tho -risp noise of the hordes nibbling at the sweet grass, and the occasional rustic of some adventurous pofsum that had ventured nh ng a bough to have a look at the strange white faces beneath. Not a motion, except tho regular tread of the two sentinels, who walked their parallel boats in silence, with their rifles slung under their anas, and the tomfort and consolation of a busbman's life, tlio short cutty, between their lips. And tho log fire grew lower and lower, and the red glare of the sinouldeiing embers shone tainter and fainter through the white ashes, and the sea breeze blew colder and colder as the still night advance!, ! and the low moan from the hungry sea that dashed upon the distant iron-bound coast mingled* ioinUy with the h.tlf- ; heprd .'igh of the wind, nnd the tar away snow peaks shi-ne whitely and calmly and bolily in the soft dim moonlight, j aiid r-ilcntc r-U-pt' over the still face of theearfh. Then camo midnight, and there was n movement in the camp, and those who were not accustomed to '* bushiug it' woko up. and a muttering of ' Come Jack, rouse up,' and Jack Kennedy and the Englishman, whose watch it was, sluug tho rifles across their arms, and {is«umed the scntrj'ship, and the rest fell ofl* again in'--) their slumbers, until tlie dim prey of the Eastern sky announced that another day would I break fcO'-n. Then at four o'clock came another change of | watch, aud shortly afterwards, ono by one, as they had I sought then' couches, they woke, and sitting up, shrouded in their blankets lite sheeted ghosts, they nibbed their eyes, looked what sort of a morning it was, and began to rake I amongst the burnt out ember-, lor a iirestick yet alight, preparatory to the morning burnt incense of tho Indian weed. Their second day's journey took them ovor a number oi ranges of low hills, similar to iho one nt whose base they had Gift camped, nnd which seemed to be spurs from the vast mountain wall which towered beyond the wooded heights to fhe right, and they seemod to be graiuiUly ad vancing into a country of the nature of that to the ifcurtli oi' tho long lino of coast lakes to which tliey were uow on the South, that is, a dark brown sandstone heath, covered with low dull vegetation and bush flowers, and abounding with Australian game of nil kinds. Along this droaiy ex panse they travelled three days, coming about midday of the third to a broad muddj' coloured river, flowing through n swampy flat, and bordered with dark green dirty-lookicg stunted mangrove bushes, not being able to reach tbe bod of the river tiirough the soft spongv moss, they had to .-liike off to the Westward, crossing shallow creeks skirted with tank vegetation, treacherous green coatol pools, and fott mossy ground, where the horses continually sank up to their luces, and where they had to proceed very cautiously ior fear some unlu' ky horso and rider might be bogged in an unseen quagmire.* At last, after struggling for several hours through the plashy mud, regretting at every step that they had not retraced their way along fhe firm ground, until they had headed the marsh, they reached a narrow tongue of higher land, which seemed to' shoot out from the sflndstone heath along which they had been traveUm^ mid heie they were glad tocanip for the night. They unloaded their weaiy horses, and allowed them to ramble to tho edge of the bog, where the grass grew thick and long, and pro ceeded to make themselves as comfortablo as they could under tlie circumstanecs ; they passed, howe ver, a miser able night ; in the first place, they could find nothing of which to make a fiic, then, although there was no lack of water, it was so dirty and nasty as to be totally unlit to drink, nnd even the very dog6 refused to tou-:h it,* then the mosquitoes were so numerous and so voracious tliat they crept under tho handkerchiefs they tiod round their heads fur protection, ond bit most furiously, then tboy discovered that lhey were in the very heart of a colony of snakes, black, brown, green, diamond, whip, carpet, nnd deadliest of aB, copper- coloured ; eo that altogether they were about as miserable as any body of men could be, however, like all pleasant things, all unpleasant things must como to an end, so when the morning 6un rose high in tlio heavens, and drove away the chills and shivers they had contracted by lying in the very midst of that miasmie vapour bath, aud nt about ten o'clock they suddenly came to a bright creek, flashing in the sunlight over its rocky bod, and sinking into deep dark pools of clear cold water, they forgot nil their troubles, and took a long spell on its margin. After travelling towards the distant ranges until sunset lhey enmpod, intending to make another attempt fo cross the river in the morning; they found, however, tho next day, to their intense disgust, that the wholo country, as far as iho eye could see, was an immenso swamp, with tho river running through it, at a distance of seven or eight miles from tho spot whore tliey stood at the edgo of the bog, they therofoie concluded that it must bo ouo of tho large shallow lakes which form small inland seas in tho rainy season, and the spring, and in tho hot weather become either whollj' dried up, or, liko this one, immense tracts of muddy mangrove covered swamp. Thero was no thin? for it then, but to bolder its edgo until they arrived at higher ground, where they might cross and proceed into tho Mun dnrrali country, which still lay much farther South; this was not so easily done ; the rolling rises seemed to form a natural omphithcatro round this dismal flat, and as day niter day they advanced nearer and nearer to the mountain ranges, which it had been their special object to avoid, tliev began to fear that they would have lo find a passage I through the dangerous gorges and up the steep cliffs of the granite precipices which frownoi on thorn in front. Nor wero they wrong, for keeping close to tho margin of tho swamp they found that, although it nanowed as it ap proached the foot of the mountains, it also deepened, and at last formed a lake apparently about a mile and a half in width, which ran into the veiy mountains themselves, and was surrounded by stoop and towering precipices, over ono of which the river camo tumbling from a height of two or three hundred feet. Hero thon was a complete bar to their progress, a wide lako in frontj a proverbially inaccessible range of mountains, abounding in deep chasms, and j slippery crag* on the right, and on all other sides nothing but— return.— Bet urn along the rough rocky base of the precipitous cliffs which forbad their further passage ,? mile after weary mile, ovor plateaus of broken slate, seamed with sharp quartz reefs, and through the tonglod fern that prow round inmenso bouldors, whore uphoaved by some xuigbiy convulsion of nature lay iu wild tumbled confusion, granite, sandstone, yellow clay, and schist; mile after wtwy mile, nn i btill tliat barren rooky wall, those impene trable dills, until night bogan to spread her soft mantle over the earth, nnd they were fain to halt and rest, and sleep iiom very weariness, lulled by tho light wind which moaned amongst the jagged clifls and serrate i ridges of hnuslcne overhead, und in the morning they again started, upon their toilsome march, milo after weary mile, cutting f'cep into the veiy heart of tho pinnacled ridges ran a deen glen or chasm, whoncc issuod a brawling littlo cifck which had its rise high up amongi-t the distant snovr peals. Hero thero was un entrance to those dark glass t.nd gloomy Utiles through wliich they must pass to roach the unknown country, where the blackfellow Btill ranged undisturbed over bis own domain, and here it was that Jimmy Warren, the blackboy, who with Laiifcy Jim had a- companied tho party, broke out into on csblamation of surprise and recognition. 44 1 bin this place plentytime, you see rae go 'long/' 44 What Jim,' eaid Edward, ' do you know this plocc?' 4- Plenty blackfellow all about over tliat ridgo ; you nuko a light, they cobbon big follow, tliey take your ki-mey fat.' 44 Take j'our kidney fat!' echood the Englishman 'what the deure does he mean by that?' Edward explained thot tho hoy meant luat over tho ridge he had indicated dwelt a tribe of ferocious blacks, probably a branch of his own savage tribo, and referreS to tbeir well-lnowu custom of smearing themselves over with the kidney fat of their slaughtered eneuues, which, eo they thought, had tho cficct of making them stroug. It was evident from the demeanour of the black that they were prorco^ing into a dangerous neighbourhood, for he appealed frightened, and kept close to the party, con tinually saying 44 blackfellow over there, cobbon maton^, tukc pknty hit.' But relying on the strength of his purly, who, armed ns they were, professed the utmost contempt for Iheir^black foes. Edward determined to push on over the mountains, contenting himself with halting in se ure places, and placing double sentinels to guard the cum]) at night, with strict orders to fire at once upon tho first living thing they saw approaching. Two cuy» had been spent in the mountains, and they hud not yet reachcd the shoulder of tho great snow wall, over which, they hud to pass; they had two or three times been obliged by coming to the edge of a dee]) precipice to re trace their steps, but by marking the few frees tliey passed, und cngruving an urrow head upon the large boul ccrs, pointing to the way they camo, they felt secure about finding their load buck. There had been no sickness in tho comp,a and by making easy stages, and now and thon chiingiiig their puck horses, had kept their cattle in goo4 condition. On the morning of tho third day, oncoftho men, who had wandered a liitlo distance from tho camp to a watciholc, came bat k with the utmost horror depicted ou his countenance; ho had jumped across the creek, lie said, in pursuit of a large guana, which ho thought would bo nice, cooked under the fire, when turning round a largo lump of granite, he bal conic face to face with a skeleton of a man sittiug 011 a little hillock, and grinning at him. The wholo party proceeded at onco in the direction indicated, and there, sure enough, lhey found a human skeleton, not as thu teirifTtd fellow hau said, sitting on a hillock, but in a half-sitting, half-lying position, upon a doping bank, and against the trunk of a stunted gum tree, it wus evidently that of a bushranger, or an escaped con vict, who had Ced to these wild regions for shelter against the pui suing police, for at his feet lay a gun worm-eaten in fhe block, and corroded by thick rust in the lock and barrel, and the moleskin trousers and blue woollen shirt were tattered and dropping iu pieces from decay, showing the bones washed by the winter's rain, and bleached by tho summer's sun. Cut deeply into the bare trunk oftbotreo was the word DIG in rude charactcrs, and on sinking a ticneh round its foot they came upon an old rusted tin 44 billy,' inside which was a pannikin, upon whose bottom was s'crutebed, as wilh the point of a knife, an inscription. This, it w as diilicult to decipher, on account of the rust which had begun t^ attack the enclosed utensil; but after kouio trouble it wus made out to say : — 44 1 have escaped from tho Blaks ; my arm is broak ; thor is no water. God havo nicrsy on me. J anuary 20, 1845. John Molov, aged 38. Jack the Pox.' They recollected that twelve months before there liad been a noted bushranger of this name aud toubriquel, who for fume time had been the terror of the Bcllowrv district; burning, pillaging, and murdering all who stood in his way; that the native police lia-a been sent upon his track ; that he had been followed io the lakes, where he was lost; sight of, and that it was supposed he had crossed by tho , back of Mount Tambo, north-westward to the Murruin bidgee country; here however lie was: here he had diod, alune in the patlilcss ranges, liis blood coursing through his veins wilh the fever of liis maimed arm, his tliroat parohed by the hot north wind, his longue blackening for lack of water, and his dim eyes loosing in vain into the bright bluo st y above him for the thunder clouds in the south. And he had gene into the presence of his God, not recklessly blaspheming and ctu sing, but humbly praying for mercy und pardon, and fitfully dreaming of pleasant crocks and green tdds, and porehnnce, of a shady swectbriar covered porch in a iar distant land, and a grey old niuit, taking himself a little boy the hand, und leading him fouh up by the grove of becch treeB, to meet a sturdy black- whiskered ; ploughman, who came whirling down the lane. And of seeing a grief- worn female face straining close to the bars cf the dock, where be stood a sullen felon, and then tho pangs of burning thirst woke him oncc more to the dreary Loners of his situation, and gasping for breath and for pardon from his offended Maker, he sat him down to die. Whether that pardon were vouchsafed, let us not ask; God is- a Cod of mercy, ns well as of justice, and he who forgave the thief upon the crc^s at the eleventh hour might also forgive the many offences of the penitent convict. Let us not judge, for him, hunted like a wild beast, steeped iu eve ry kind of villainy aud crime, whose life had been an outrage ou the laws of God and man, even from him was the veil of tho temple rent in twain, and fhe sun lud his fare, and nature shook with a throe ol' terror at the voice which cried 44 Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani r' (lo be continued .J
