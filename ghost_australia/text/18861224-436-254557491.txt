RELIGIOUS MANIA. Religious mania most frequently displays itself in the minds of persons whose intelligence and education are below the average; but an exception to what may be taken as a general rule is just now to be met with in Cincinnati, in America. In that town a matter of forty inhabitants, described as "prominent, and above the average in intelligence," are afflicted with a strange form of religious madness. They believe that two ladies, both married, and sisters, are respectively Christ and the Holy Ghost manifest in the flesh; and so great is tbe influence exercised by these two women that their followers, in order to worship them, have, in many instances, given up lucrative positions, and abandoned their calling and homes to live near them. The fanatics forming the new sect—which is the talk of the day at Cincinnati—account for the fact that Christ should manifest Himself in a female, by tho theory that in Heaven there are no sexes. Many of the foolish people who have given up their positions are already in sore straits how to live. But they decline to work, saying they have no need of money, the Millennium being at band; all they require is spiritual food, which will be permitted them by Divine agency. Religious mania is admitted to be one of the most difficult forms of brain disease to cure. Nevertheless, -we think the relatives or friends of the forty " prominent citizens of Cincinnati " would do well to place them in the hands of some experienced medical man for a time, and see what effect might be produced by following a suitable regime. —Evening Standard.
