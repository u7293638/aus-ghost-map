OATLANDS. From a Correspondent. - - Last Friday night our Premier Minstrels gave another of their highly amusing and interesting en tertainments, in aid of the local orioket club, iu.the public schoolroom, kindly lent for the occasion. Tho weather was most unpropitious. It had rained and snowed all day long, and I never saw tbo town ship wear a gloomier aspect. In consequence of such fearful weather, tho audicnco was confined ex clusively to the township, it boing out of the ques-: tion to expect to see those residing in the district. ; who had promised their patronage, to putin an ap pearance. The followiog is a short sketch of the ! evening's amusement : â€” Song and chorns, "'Down; the. River!' . (Company), was well rendered, and : highly) appreciated. " Babios on tho Block," by Mr.' O. Powell,' was a hit, ho being a man who can ) sing a good song. Mr. Sydney Willis, in a very i appropriate military costume, and good . voice, in-, ! formed the audience, " I don't want to fight," - A' : vocal duet, "Both Sides of the Question," was well ! rendered by Messrs. Madden and Aitohisoo. ."Tim1 Jennings, "/well sung by Mr. J. S. Roche,' tho ener- getic secretary of the O.O.O. >The stump speech, i which is considered not the least amusing of a ! minstrel entertainment, was capitally delivered by ; Mr.- .Harry, .Rainsford,, and caused , great : amuse- :ment. The wliole ponoluded.', witb, a lapghablo j farce, entitled The Echo, Mr. S. Willis being ; ghost, and a better representative could not be , found. ' Mr. G. Bradsbaw's efforts as pianist were a great contribution towards the evening's entertain- ment. Another for the same objeot will take place shortly) the date being made known by advertise ment. ' - \- The Town Hall, so long talked of and- eagerly looked for, is to"be commenced next month, and,. : according .to.the plans by Mr. H. Lord, it will.be a very imposing-looking building.
