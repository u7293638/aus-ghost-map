THE HEN WHO DIED. Gentlemen, stand for a silent toast, To be drank with drooping head; The men who died at a falling post, Who won the leaBt, and who gave the most— ' To oar brave, defeated dead. i Ghosts of the slain call oat to-night From their graves across the sea. 1 Soldiers slain in a losing fight— A wild attack on a mountain height, Or a hopeless charge—are we. c Soldiers crossing a ford in flood, Or led to a false attack ; Dragging oar gans throagh seas of mad, Darkling the earth with oar heart's best blood As we fought oar passage back. ' Soldiers marched through the sunbarnt day, Marched throagh the cold, chill night. Walking asleep; in the morning grey In front of the trenches brought to bay, With an unseen foe to fight. 4 Soldiers—pawns of the gen'ral's game, Yet with lives to lose or live— Done to death on a field of shame : \ , 7 We gave oar lives for oar country's name-— „ We had nothing more to give. Gentlemen, drink with uplifted head, Proud though the worst is faced; f Gentlemen, here's to our honored dead, The men who fought, and the men who bled Defeated, but not disgraced ! —To-Day.
