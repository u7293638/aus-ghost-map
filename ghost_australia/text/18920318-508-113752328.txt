WILLIAMS IE SYDNEY. When ' Williams ' first arrived in Sydney he was taken up by a friend who originally came from the same part of England. This friend took him to a boarding-house at Middle-street, Chippendale, kept by a highly respectable wid&w.; The friend found employment for ' Williams ' at Tooth's Brewery ; but this tsosition be did not hold long, as he quarrelled with Ms superior. He afterward opened up a little business in Castlereagh-street, which abruptly ended with his arrest for theft, an-3. a sentence of six months' imprisonment followed. While residing with the widow he was always talking of his ' dear wife, Marion,''' who he said was in England, and for whose companionship ho longed. This lady arrived in Sydnpy while ' Williams ' was in prison. He was accustomed to sleep with Marion's photo giaph beneath. his pillow. He was remarked for his consistency in attending St. Paul's Church. The widow was eventually obliged to set rid of ' Williams,' on account of his mysterious manner, and particularly for his whining complainings that ' a ghost haunted bis room at night time.' On one occasion he rushed down stairs to his landlady and, in a state of roal or acted terror, said that he was intercepted uu the stairway by ' the ghost.' It afterwards came to light that ' Williams,' who incidentally let out that the. second name he bere at that time — ' Bailey ' — was the name of his mother's people, stole clothing and other effects from the mate employed on the vessel that brought ' Williams ' hera.
