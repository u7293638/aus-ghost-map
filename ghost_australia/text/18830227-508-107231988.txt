' In a moment the footman had flung apart: the broad folding doors at the end .et the corridor, showing a htii'lsoms reception room, and bayond ? that a long, glittering -pieta of riohly furaiflhed apartments.

The first two wore drawing-roams, aglow wifch light- and odorous with tie fragrant flowers . profusely scattered in ereiy direction. : The third ended the brilliant vMa, sump- \ tuonsly epread tAble, weighted with a glittering service or silver and a magnificent epergne of j rarest flowers, sufficiently proclalminj its us*.
