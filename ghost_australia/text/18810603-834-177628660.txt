Arrived in Bomo, I was much too deeply ab sorbed in what lay before me to be effected by the various 'things I saw ; but it was a slight comfort! to me at present to think that though I had sworn to do an apparent im possibility,.! had also the hope of finding my oouBin, and helping' her ; and though tho dreadful ' weight on my mind was always there, I seemed also to dwell less on that and more on the ohanco ot being of some nse to the only person in the world connected with me, thoagh bo distantly. I made many inquiries about Signora Bianca. Many people knew her by name, and she was known to be dead ; but no clue could I get to any one who knew her per sonally. One day, however, I went to a small color ?hop, where I had been before, attracted by a clever sketch of some Greek boatmen. As I wont in, a yonng girl turned her bead, and I saw before me the living image of the picture which hung in my haunted room at home. * : 'The Signor's arrival is a happy event,' said the man. who -had talked with me be fore. . 'The Signora has paintings of the Signora Bianoa's, and wishes to sell them.' ; To this day ,1 cannot make out how I man aged to control my emotions. But it was no Burprise to me to have a oard with my cousin's name put into my hands, and to be told to call there next day to see Bianca's pictures. Moments were hours ; but at last, breathless,. I arrived at the top of an old Palazzo. I was shown in by a respectable looking old woman,- and found my cousin at her easel, painting. ' She was so-young, so fair, and so dignified, I 'do not' know how to begin my story. Maria, the old woman, got out a great portfolio, and assisted her. young mistress iu showing . off '. the paintings, and as I said nothing, a quiver of disappointment made itself heard id my cousin's voice. J . ' You do not ; admire these things,' she said at length, 'and yet they are beauti ful!'' -.:' . .-?-. . 'I admire them all,' I said hurriedly. ?*I. was only wondering what I ought to offer you for them.' \- '? For the whole of them?' she said,- with ? evident surprise. ' '. ? ? .'Yes,' I. answered. 'They would look well: all framed alike, and hnng: in -one- room.' She. looked at me for a moment, and I. said, 'I will give you whatever you consider them to b» worth.' : ' I saw her .color come and go, and I guessed, that, with all her pride, the. money was an object to her. She trembled a little, aud I saw tears rush to her eyes, and I could no longer act the part of- a stranger, to' .her. :Ab quietly as I could 1' told her Who: I was, and asked hor if she had ever heard; of me. .

She: was touched when she found that I had from, the lira t wanted to befriend her, and her manner, was kind and sympathetic. . All loye stories are very much alike ? and ourssoon became a love atory. I lovedher pas sionately; as il Iqvo her now— God bleBs her I \- —and. yet I was too much .of a coward to tell her my story. At first it was a struggle. I felt ane ought to know; but by degrees .everything faded from my mind. I dreamed of her; 1 thought only of her; she was an ever, increasing joy to : me ; and when finally, she; agreed to become my wife, I never for a second iqmernbered that there was a horrible duty which I had sworn to perform. The past,' wretched past, was , blotted from my mind, and I: was:happy I Then we married. Ten days were. granted me of the most per fect happiness. We wandered about like two children, taking tho some intense delight in flowers and in music. ,^Vhen my wife sang, .it was like a flood o£ melody from heaven— the liquid round notes hud such path,op in.them ; and I used to think if erer I waa ill or suffering, her voioe alone would restore me.; To a man who had never known what beauty thereis in a womanly obaracter, tha touches of sympathy, the exquiaito re finement and purity of her thoughts were a revelation. ..Cay after day, things eeemed to Bhow me what a new, freah, and beautiful .world lay around mo; and my. secret was flqmpktely forgotten... .

When I was well again we went on, stayed a few days at Neuf chatel, and so on through Prance, and found ourselves in London. Here we chose furni ture and papers, and were busy in various ways. We had been married some months now, and my wife bad been writing many directions home ; then came the last even ing of our stay in London, and my wife rose and sat down beside me, aud I felt from a little movement of her hands, which was the only sign she ever gave of nervousness, that she was going to speak Beriously to me.
