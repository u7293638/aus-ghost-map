The Victim of the Sewing Machine. SHE sat at the sewing machine, While the wheel with a murmur sped ; And her eye was sunk, and her cheeks were shrunk, And her lip the colour of lead. And she looked like a ghastly thing, A wavering, dismal shade, And the murmuring sent from the instrument Seemed a dirge for that ghost-like maid, Then the clergyman came to her side, And he saidâ€”" This is toil indeed ;" " Yes, toil," said she, " That is killing me As fast as the wheel can speed." Then he laid his band on the board, While the needle like lightning flew, When suddenly swelled his voice and he yelled, "You're stitching my finger through I" "Remember the patience of Job," Said she, with a ghostly moan ; Then he murmured low, as his tears fell, " Oh 1 The patience of Job be blown! Pray, what," asked the meek divine, " Had Job with his patience been, If his fingerwere, like my finger there, Stitched up by a sewing machine ?" And she's still at her toil, I ween, And she moaneth a ghostly moan; And her eyes are sunk, and her cheek is shrunk, And she's nothing but skin and bone. And the wheel goes round and round To win her a bit and a sup, And the says subdued, " Oh I that priest was slew d When I stitched his finger up." " ALWAYS behind time," as the schoolboy laid to the letter E. "What a thundering swell you are," as the little boat said to the b l" TnTfond of beef, but I don't like it c(h)orned," aa the young man said when the bull tossed him into theair.
