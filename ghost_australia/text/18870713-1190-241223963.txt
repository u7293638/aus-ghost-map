SENSATIONAL STATEMENT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THF ASSO- I niATlfYV Touching tho cause of tho agitation, Mr Smith mado a statement which is of very considerable ' importance. What ho said was, as near as possible, ' this-:â€” "i- nave no doubt in my own mind although I have not a ghost of proof that the cause of all this agitation is a charge hanging over tiio head of tho. president of tho Engine Drivers and Freinan's Association. Somo ten days neo tho man who is an cngtnedriver, over ran his points nnd tho engine left tho raffs. I had a board nrpointed to inquire into tho matter, and ' that board had tho cose beforo them last Thursday, Now, this man has a bad record, 'ho has hod four charges against him, nnd in my mind I believo that ho ' has gob up this agitation in order if possiblo affect the' decision in his case, and get him out ol the scrape." Mr Smith docs not hesitate to give this as his own belief. but, of course, ho points ont that he has nothing by which to corrobomt tlio idea. No dmibt, however, this will be ono of tho points which will command tho atten tion, searching inquiry, nnd distinct,, reply of tho Association- at their adjourned meeting on Friday evening
