The modern cult of teiep&thy;,with allite various connections, *. - may be regarded as more thoughtful, a mora introspective recrudescence of the old primitive belief. After centuries of "enlightenment" and sceptical analysis which has produced a widespread agnosti cism, theluilt between primitive mankind and -ourselves of to-day seems to be in process of renewal, and not a few scien tific menof highstandingaos not ashamed to declare that experiments have con vinced them that human thought can transcend the limits of time and space and that minda can communicate with each other without any apparent material medium. In a noble poem Tennyson has welcomed the coming of this new era when the fetters of materialism will be thrown off, and the conception as well as the fact of the spiritual world will expand ^—^'ijTs the mind of man.

If thought- transference is possible between London and New York. Is it absurd to suppose that it is possible between- our «arth and Saturn, assuming conscious life is present on that distant planet 1 If the universe is one, and if every wave in its rhythmic motion Impinges on evezy other wave in the infinite Bea of universal being, can we set any limits to die bounds within which thought operates; can we sav to any spirit, whether within or without the body, " Hitherto shall thou come, and no further 9" Can we say, M Within such and such limits your thought shall extend and influence others, but not beyond f' Cut we, indeed, conceive of such limits as possible, when once we have attained , the idea that those we call the dead are j still living, and the cognate idea that j thought oan influence thought without! material medium ? Prom this point of view the question of ] Ihe influence of the dead over the living becomes one oL«jch bewildering interest that wogj|axfaU the imagination in con eaivibgifc The whole universe is oue great whispering gallery, and we are again ; surrounded, as the Apostle said, by a "greatclotitd-of witnesses."

This was, in cruder forms, the idea of the old-world Animism, and it is the idea suggested by the newer thought of oar time. In the curious book to which we {have referred, and much of which consist* ofjrhst may bo called excellent spiritual platitudes,.Mr. Stainton Moses professes to from his guide in the " next world" aiietplftnatiou of much of the no aud misery which baffles as here, and which does notweua to be explained by the hypothesis of heredity or physical encironmeut.

If «o, how do we explain demoniacal possession, how -do explain numberless allusions in the Uftir Testament? It may be (and, .■»*■/ member, we are all along suggesting rather than asserting) that our good and evil thoughts can: both be explained by referring them to heredity ana ordinary environment; but a pereon of large ex- i perience in life has, we incline to think, ' many subtle temptations, many persua-. sire influences operating on his inner nature, which cannot be so explained. ' What If these come from an invisible host encamped all round us ? What if the lower order of beings who have died after si life of vice, ignorance, -and degra dation, do haunt the minds of their old companions in sin and drag them down : into deeper evil ?'

Wftvt belong reign of^togterialiani, *ny the voioeless ^pi^l - We reply that the world, if it means anything more than a .series of purposdees phenomena, means and exists for the education of man ;*iand the most essential fact in that education is the moral culture which enables man to form aud maintain civilised society.v We do not toy this is the loftiest object ' of man's being, but it is the nearest, the most requiaite for life sis it should be in this present world. Had mankind been plunged Into the overwhelming spiritual life beyond, at which we have hinted, could.he have; patiently, worked on the hard prnblemsof civilisation? It is only when be has solved these problems, only .when, that! is to jay. lie liaa learned to dwell and work in honesty and Amity with his fellows (for that is substantially what civilisation means), that he can' be Bafely trusted to enter on th?se stupendous problems of the spiritual world, in the consideration of which he might-wreck his very moral being without the steady task of civilising the world to which lie has been called. And ao it may be that, as the chief nations of the world are approaching the termination of their lower civilising task, they are about to take up once more the broken threads of ancient Animism and weave them into a complex strand of high spiritual purpose aud endeavor.
