Most unwiilijig to go back isnthout accomplHh iiig her purpose, liuth crossed the creaky old 3oor, and knoeked at the door of an inner room, the only other apartment the house contained. Silence followed her first knock ; the second brought die invitation, ' Coma in,' spoken in ia indifferent, abstracted toae. Bat Buth promptly opened the door.

He turned as he spoke ; he raised his eyes. In stead of the dark, impassive countenance of the Indian woman, be saw the startled, horrified face of the girl whose image had mixed wirh his bitter thonghts of himself. * Ruth !' Se cried eagerly. He et&rted; to his feet, with outstretched hand. But he dropped back, and looked up at her speechlessly, hie pal* fe&tures; working. Than a smile— a ghastly gleam of self mockery — crossed his lips. He rose and approached her, ana held ont his hand. She recoilsa from it, shuddering. ' Did I not E»y y6n would reliise to take my hand when Jre met again?' he said, with that mirthless emiio. ' How could I dream that your hand was stained with blood — the blood o£ my father's brother ?

The look he fixed upon her was Incre^ul6ae, half fecorhf ul, but it had aa Hinder meaning of iiitense- wiBtlnineES. The same meaning gave a pathetic minor chord to his cynical voice as he asked ; . . 'Would you believe me?' - ? She wa& silent.
