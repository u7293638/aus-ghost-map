Fotjb Ghost Stories. By Mrs. Molea wnrtti TVTsu»millan Ar. fin.. Trfin«?nTV These are not stories of the horrible, blocd and thunder, hair-raising order, but they are none the less impressive on that account, for the reader has a feel ing that the strange gnoauy incidents which are related are not so wildly im probable that they could by no possibility have happened. The apparitions which are described are for the mo3t part gentle and well behaved; but even the best mannered ghost is a fearsome thing, and the man, woman, or child who could in solitude at the dead of night read these narratives without having the imagination excited to a painful extent is entitled to claim that his or her nervea are thoroughly under control. The atones are welJj even graphically, told, and the expectancy of the sensitive reader is pleasantly stimu lated by a pale female figure in gossamer rob£3 dimly outlined on the cover of the book.
