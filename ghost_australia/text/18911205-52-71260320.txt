Cycling. On the occasion of the last Austral wheel raoe at Melbourne an antiquated bicycle in the shape of an old wooden " bone-Bhaker " was ridden to the ground; BmidBt the "barracking" of the spectators. To heighten the ludicrous presence of suoh a machine amongst scores of modern " spider wheals," a placard was placed on the " voteran " bearing tho words, " Dead bird for the Austral, 1891." It is computed that at the last sports meeting of tho Melbourne Bicycle Club over Â¿65000 worth of bicycles were located within the grounds. Arthur Turner, the winner pf the Austral Whee Base for 1891, ia not one who could lay claim to being called a "crack " rider ; but he is one who possesses a largo fund of " life " and *.. go," two qualities moat essential to the success of a wheelman. He ia looked upon by clnbmen aa a very unassuming rider, and he took ma victory in the great event with every modesty. His win, although a popular one, came aa a great.surprise, ai he was reckoned by those who ought to know to be a rank outsider who had not the ghost of a show alongside Lambton, H. Lewis, and Davis. ^ The Austral wheel race has been an annual event Since 18S6, and out of the six tunca it haa been run, the " big .pot" has been annexed twice by Victoria, a eimilar number of times by'South Australia, while New South Wales and England have sent ridera who have each secured a win. On Saturday afternoon last a number of wheelmen had a run to Coogee, where some time waa spent witnessing the swimming matonea at the aquarium. The day was a beautiful one for " pedallera," and aa the. toad waa in "pink " condition it goes without saying that a very pleasant time fell to the lot of the ridera.
