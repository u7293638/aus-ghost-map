ALEXANDRA THEATRE. Tub sudden change from melodrama to Shakespearian plays has found a good deal of favor, and, although it was em phatically declared that Mr. Dampier's company could not attempt Shakespeare, they have done so—possibly not with entire success—but just as well as any other company now in Melbourne could have done. Mr. Dimpier's Hamlet was long ago accepted among, the successful impersonations of the character, and his present performance is as intelligent and well marked as ever it was. Mis9 Katherine Russell's Ophelia is tender and delicate, and her treatment of the mad scene is decidedly skilfull. The surprise of the piece is Mr. H. Stoneham's Claudius. Hitherti this gentleman has been playing melodramatic parts that give him no opportunity, but as the King of Denmark, he has brightened up con siderably. Mr. Boothman, as Laertes, plays with excellent discrimination and manly feeling. Mr. W. E, Baker is ca*eful and attentive to all traditional requirements in his performance of Horatio, and Mr. J. H. Martin deserves a word of praise for his Polonius. Mr. Cm<ar as the First Actor, and Mr. Stark as the First Gravedigger, throw much vitality into their work, and Mr. Edmund Holloway represented the Ghost of Ham let's father with his usual earnestness. Miss Julia Merton, as Queen Gertrude, gives another convincing proof of her versatility, and Miss Ada Rochefort and Miss Carrie Biltm are to be singled out for their picturesque appearance. Mr. Dampier's arrangement of the play is different to what is usually given, and, seeing that the obligation of stage tradi tions press so heavily on most aotors, the present performance of Haralot is all the more worthy of praise, since it shows the independent thought that has been be stowed .upon it. Mr. Henning's scenery is some of the best that has yet been presented for Hamlet, and it is a matter for general congratulation that this popu lar artist has returned to the studio once
