THE PRUSSIAN COK SU LATE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE 11KI91UNIÃŽ COURIER. Sisson a letter, signed "A Prussian," in your paper ofycstordni, the writer shonsentiie ignorance of the duties of a Consulate, and I suspect a wish to bring the Prussians into contempt It is well known that the Austrian and Prussian Consulates are bound to assist the subjects of either power and also that nothing is more common than for travellers to have their letters sent to the office of the Consul in the various places they sit I saw nothing more than this in the advertisement referred to, in wasfiiinplva request that the accounts might be addressed to the Consulate o I have 110 connection whatever with the Consul here, but I object to Prussians cutting ridicule on an office of their own Government Yours, TO THE EDITOR OF' THE BRISBANE Cultural Sin, On perusing your edition of yesterday my attention was very forcibly arrested by a letter emanating from a terribly sarcastic Ger man-I big pin don, I should say " Prussian " in which he makes a most crushing onslaught on a gentleman who fills the onerous position of Consul to his enlightened countrymen Now, how the aforesaid Consul can manage to survive such biting sarcasm it is hard to im fine, but harder still perhaps is it for an Englishman to understand the motive that must have actuated this rev gentleman in penning such an epistle Is it that he has a passion for rushing into print, 01 does he think that the in forests of united Germany demand such a soft slice of his valuable time-not to speak of pens, ink, paper, poor, stranger still eau the writer bothe veritable retailer of groceries and butcher's meat mentioned, smarting under the injuries received by a relation of his account ? Alas, no know not, outside fear that this latter construction is a true solution of the mystery Apart from all this, however, suppo n g the letter of "A Prussian" to emanate from a gentleman, it savors much of bad taste and scant courtesy It is customary in utilised communities more especially on the Continent offer all possible hospitality and convenience to a foreigner and a stranger when travelling, and it is a matter of regret that a Prussian should have been so long absent from his country as to forget the grand old customs of his forefathers -Yours, JOHN BULL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE? BRISBANE COURIER SIR -Apropos of a letter in your issue of this day, signed " A Prussian," permit me to say a word The Prussian Consul is bound to show every reasonable attention to any native of the Great South German Confederation, and I think may very well attend his courtesy to all Germans There is, therefore, no objection that can see to his doing kind offices for Count Von Attems, whose illustrious presence inthi9CO'ony I am happy to assist in publishing, but when these services are of a merely 1 business character, and concerning money matters only, all public announcements relating thereto would look better if in the name of a mercantile firm, especially if the Consul happen to belong to one, and not in the name of the Consulate Though I try to express myself moderately on this subject, an intimate friend of the Ho len Zollern family for many years, I feel strongly about it I do not like even to contemplate the possibility of the dignity of the Prussian Con Bulato being mixed up with. Count von Attems tailoring or bills for rope yarn for the Hamlet's Ghost Another reason why I object and must protest against this sort of thing is that it may lead to worse It would not surprise me if some day the fashion was introduced of the Consuls of all nations coming down to their shops or stores in official costume, and whilst not adding to the dignity of the states they represent, throwing ordinary merchants who are consuls for nowhere completely into the shade -Yours, VOX BELLOW. [This seems to us to be a matter of no real interest to the public, and the correspondence about it must therefore end here Ed. B. C]
