SUNDAY READING. TRUTH'S TRIUMPH. CBv PhiliD Wendell Crannell.) "Magna est Veritas est prevalebit—Great Is truth and will prevail!" Thus lightly saith The student in his cloister, and his faith Is shared by millions in the mart or State, Content at ease Truth's triumph to await. Won without hands by her own God like strength, Her leap from mind to mind, until at length, All realms subdued, they hail her victory, ■ though late! Not in such wise doth victress Truth pre vail— A ghost, unbodied, powerless, and pale, Till, born in some great heart a scorn of wrong, A passionate desire, a purpose strong, Through tears and sweat and hunger, pain and loss," Scourgings and death; she conquers—by a Cross!
