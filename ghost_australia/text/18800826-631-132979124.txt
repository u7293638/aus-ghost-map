FRAGMENT PROM AN OLD LATIN ODE. A Duii deop paiu is at my heart, My oyes aro wot with bitter tears, That gusli from that still silent fount — Tho memory of bygono years. Oh 1 that within tho iron gatos Whore death receives tho trembling ghost, : ' ? Some spot wero found — somo quiet nook Whore wo might converse with tho lost ! Wlioro, far from lifo and light, and pain, In that still shadow of tho tomb, Onr Nnnln mirrl,*- -...m, U...;..,. ...wi thoy ' Fill in our hearts tho vacant room. Oh 1 kingdom rich in oonquored spoils ! Oh 1 land whonoo nono oah o'er return ! , Tho soul is shut and barred in thoo Even ns tho dust within tho urn. —Jane Q. Simpson.
