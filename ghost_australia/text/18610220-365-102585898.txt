'.'ihe crwid now iscressed rapidly, Iintil it swelletd t a lnumber as lrgo as that present two yelllts ago, 1and11 tihe interest and excitemlent were very great. Just at Ibis tine a misundlcrslanding ccurredl: Gilbert was making thile runs for Kettlec's battillng, tIle latter being lame, and lie halad just made a run fior one and Iad passed ItIe wicett, when Kettl hIlimself, who had turned from his wicket, was put out by Mr. 7lrsholl--acting oi Ilie opinlon that, though Gil bert was running for ICettle. the latter nmust be at tile stumps befire the batl clame up,just as if lie were running for himself. ''lie Victorian umpire decided. ang ainst KIettle, whereupon there was a great Ssensnlio,,'," not onl~' amongst the cricketers, but in thie crowd also, tlhe Sydney people siding with our men. At first the Victorians went to their tent in a body, alud there seelmed a chance of breaking up thie game; .bit finally the playing proceedeld. Kettle was allowedl bis run, nnd, 1 believe, tile point is resered, The .Sydney eleveen wound iup, as I told yeo by telegraph, wilth a score of 74; and the Victoriansl went in. Thlere was great applause (not very polite to thlem) when thleir first two men were put out without a inglie score. TwenIIty.six, how ever, were run up before the mein ncjourned; but four of their best players were then out. The game, tllerefore, as it openedl to- lda'y was as follows:- .sNew South Wales, first inninlgs, 74; Victlria, finst inings. 68, seculond dilitlo, 26-94. T'he Victorians bad thereflre six more wickets to ilncrease their score by; after whvlich New Solluth Wales had to get her seiond innings, 'Ilie ciliicLs niere closidered tolrrably even. Betlting Ihere was in favour of Sydney, but in lelbourne it was the other way. The duay is file, but lIot and douibtful. Of course the interest in the mlatch is now at cnulminatilng point. I shull send the score on nnMotlaiy. "Their lordships the bishops" have nmade a deail set agaiost the Church and School Landts Bill.

'There is the ldeuce to 1pay in tihe police and gnol ldeparlltmellnts. Thlo. inlquiiry respecting Captain lBatStye's arrangemnents s i been for some time pro ceeiling, andil that oilicer is in Sydney to give an sccount thereof. As to the gaol deplartmelnt, the result of inlquiries into allegedl abuses is, that the sheriff, tile governlor of the gaul, antl tihe principal turnkey are suspendedlll, nd il Mr. Ilspector RIead, the same 1who ferreclted ot thile Goulburn-street brothels, owned by Mr. lhnltll, lims gone uip to trate cbargo ol tile penol for the present. I will tot repeat mere rumours as to the lnture of the cliarges, as this will be mnade public in a feIw daIys. Bell's Life' says:--' Cavalaghl one of the two Coclkatoo prisoners who recently elrfectcedl their escanpe from Darlinghurst, was captured oni Weldnlesdlay in theI Krrijoing mnountains by the Willdsor police. The olther prisonler, Clarkie, is still at large. We are iiotrmed that a most rigid illvestigation hlas been instituteld, relative to thile conduct of th ie gaol oflicials, andl that alrueady several suspensions have been inade." Thile following is from the ' Freeman's Journal:' II"The contrnct for linisbingl the addiitiun to St. Mary's Cathelral is progressing most satisfactorily. Thle roof is now coalmltte, the slating having been fiiulhed last wveekl. 'IThle westernl gable of the old buildling hias also been token down with tlhe gallery, and 'he floorinlg is bcing pushed on, so that the whole will be comapleted by Eiaster. Wlhen opened it will be the largest building in the whole colony, being considterably larger tllanl the hall of the Uni versilty. We hlope the Ciatholllics of Sydney, wlhen they witness tie resuolts of their subscription, will at once begit aneow to Iraise f'unlds to still flrther oelllarge the cathedlllral by remloving the soutllern wall, andl thus enable Iris grace to carry out his illntenltions withl regard to the metropolitan church of' Sydney."
