LIFE IN LONDON OR THEREABOUT. CHRONICLED BY HENRY LUCY. A CONQUERING AUSTRALIAN—MR. DISRAELI'S SUC- CESSOR—A DUAL FAMILY—LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL—THE NEW POSTMASTER-GENERAL MR. GLADSTONE—HIS HEALTH AND SPEECH—WHAT HE THINKS OF GHOSTS—A STATUE FOR AN AUS- TRALIAN—A CHILD OF MIRACLE. WESTMINSTER, SEPT. 11. Lord Randolph Churchill will by this time have had discomforts of life in Mashonaland, more or less pleasantly varied by an item of domestic news. His sister, who in the Marlborough family of to-day bears the Chris- tian name of the greatest woman of this interesting race, is engaged to be married to the son and heir of a gentleman Australia recently gave back to Great Britain, and who now sits as Con- servative member for Portsmouth. Sir Samuel Wilson has been with us now some 10 years, and is naturally much better known in Vic- toria than Middlesex. When, reversing the usual order of things, he in 1880 (or was it in 1881?) emigrated from Australia to England, he went to work in prompt business fashion to secure a footing in English society. There are two ways in which the start may be made, and Sir Samuel took them both. First he got into Parliament ; then he took a country house, more famous than ancient. But that was no matter. Since the property that opportunely came into the market was Hughenden Manor, where in his declining years Mr. Disraeli had cultivated peacocks and primroses, it would do almost as well as if it were Chatsworth or Clumber. It was a lucky tide of fortune, and, taken at the flood, led on to other successes. Sir Samuel comes of the shrewd race that people the north of Ireland. Though he is to-day the lord of Hughenden Manor, with a house in Grosvenor-square, he was 60 years ago born at Ballycloughan, county Antrim. When he first turned his thoughts towards Westminster he modestly proposed to enter it by the avenue of Londonderry. But Londonderry would not have him, a matter regretted at the time, but which proved to be a blessing in disguise. In the House of Commons, though in the eye of the Speaker, all men are equal, the status of the representative of an English constituency ranks higher than that of a mere Irish member. Defeated in Londonderry in 1881, Sir Samuel was five years later returned member for Portsmouth, which borough he now silently represents. In tho rnterv al ho had iloivn at higher gamo It was not sufficient that ho should fin Mr Disraeli's placo at Hughendon It seemed part of tho fit noss of things that ho should also represent the county which for a generation had been associated with tho namo of the groat statesmen So at tho general election of 1885 he put up for North Bucks, and was peremptorily put down by the constituents. They could not help his having Hughenden, but were determined he should not also have the full succession to Mr. Disraeli's heritage in the county. Tor tho present, thereforo, Sir Samuol must needs bo content with Hughenden, which it is his pride to proserve as nearly as possiblo as it w as left vt hen Lord Beaconsfield last stood on tho steps bound for London, and all unconsciously took his last look 01 cr a sceuo ho reilly loved The pea- cocks plumo themselves on tho lawn us thoydid for his delight In spring primroses star the glades,
