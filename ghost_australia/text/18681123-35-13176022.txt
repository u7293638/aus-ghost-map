ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SYNOD OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA. THE Synod of Eastern Australia met in St George's Church, Sydney, on Tuesday, the 3rd instant, at half-past 7 pm The retiring Moderator having been presented furn omMng in time to preach the opening sermon, the Rev William McIntyre dear ored an address based upon Acts i , 8 "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon, you, and of shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth ' The address was to the following effect -These words were addressed by the risen Saviour to the Apostles whom he had chosen We are not to suppose, however, that they do not at all open to the non official members of the Church if we except such acts as are strictly official, and what is strictly official in the manner of performing other acts, there is nothing which it is the duty. of office-bearers to do that it is not the duty of non-official members to do, so far OF it may be practicable for them to do it. It is the duty of office-bearers to proclaim and apply the truth, this is their great duty , but it is the duty of non official members also to proclaim and apply it as this may be able, and most have opportunity And even a hat non-official members cannot do themselves it is their duty to do by the agency of proper office bearers, using all legitimate means to procure this agone and doing their utmost to maintain it It devolves upon all the members of the Church to see to it that the Church's work is done, and to contribute in their respective places, and according to their respective means and opportunities, to the doing of it Office-bearers, however, are under peculiar obligations Certain duties, as regards the performance of them, though not as regards the making of provision for performing them, are committed to them exclusively and as regards the di ties, or at least some of the duties, that devolve on them and on non-official members in common, they alone are authorised and commissioned to perform them as the organs of the Church And while they thus occupy the highest and most distinctly c pros mee of the Church's acts at, the i performance by the non- official numbers of their respective duties, and the fitness of the Church in respect of character and effort to serve the great purposes of its existence, i greatly depend on their zeal and faithfulness The office-bearers of the Church have their appointment from Christ, and, as such office bearers, they are subject to his exclusion of authority. The words before us were old dressed by Christ to " the Apostles whom he had chosen, " and, though he does not now choose and appoint office bear ers by his own direct personal agones as he chose, and though he does not now choose and appoint office-bearers by his own direct personal agency as he chose and appointed them, he still no less locally, as administering the covenant of grace, chooses and appoints all duly authorised office-bearers And, as the office-bearers of the Church have their op] ointment and their commission from Christ, they are under law to him in the whole exercise of their office Those whom Christ calls to office in his Church he qualifies for its duties, and he does so not only in the more ordinary administration of Providence, but also and further by the supernatural agency of the Spirit, visiting them with the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, and imparting to them suitable spiritual gifts for then respective e spheres of labour and departments of usefulness All the members of his Church and, in a very special manner, its office bearers, by whose agency it is that to a great extent it performs its functions as an organised God j, Christ has constituted " witnesses " unto him To all of them he says, as he sold to the Apostles, "Ye are witnesses unto me ... unto the uttermost part of the earth. The whole of the Church's work, Moved under one of its aspects, consists in bearing testimony, full and faithful testimony, for Christ, the testimony which it is thus the Church's duty to beer for Christ in all its utterances, and in its whole character and history, but especially by the agency of its office-bearers, respects his person, his offices, his execution of them, and the benefits which he has procured and dispensed And that this deportment of its testimony may be intelligible and regarded it must bear a clear and earnest testimony with respect to man's natural state, and his great and urgent need of the salvation re sealed and offered in the Gospel The testimony with which the Church is entrusted respects further Christ's claims, and the homage to which he is entitled, as both Head of the Church and as Prince of the kings of the earth. The homage which he claims, and to which he is entitled as Head of the Church, includes exclusive obedience to him, and undeviating adherence to his arrangements and instructions, in all that pertains to the constitution and government of his Church, and the dispensa- tion and maintenance of its ordinances, and the homage which he claims, and to which he is entitled as the Prince of the kings of the earth, includes obedience to him on the port of civil communities and their rulers, and the promo- tion by them of his cause in every way competent to them, as by giving civil sanction to the truth, and by the application of the public funds Voluntaryism dealing as it does that it is the duty of civil rulers, or of civil communities as such, to promote the cause of Christ, under any circumstances, in either of the way B specified, is so far, and therefore to a grievous extent, a rejection of the claims of Christ and ErastianiBm, conceding as it does to civil rulers a right of authentic o interference with the internal administration of the affairs of the Church, which the Church has not conferred on them, and denying as it also does, that Christ, by requiring that the internal administration of the affairs of the Church shall be conducted by its own office bearers alone in accordance with the laws which he has given to it, has forbidden the exercise of such interference by civil rulers, and submission to it on the part of the Church, is so far in another direction, and also to a grievous extent of rejection of the claims of Christ But a compromise, to the effect that the Saviour s claims, so for OR Voluntarism and Erastianism has also of rejection of them, shall not be asserted or denied, that no testimony shall be borne with respect to them-and it is by such a compromise that the Unions effected in these colonies have been reached not only a mi to extended, but, at the same time, of more treacherous, because a concerted rejection of his claims , it is a deliberate rejection of them for a consideration end of purpose Unionists are accustomed to contend that it is not necessary in this part of the world to bear the testimony which has been thus suppressed, that is, that it is not necessary in this part of the world to bear a full testimony to Christ s headship This testimony they would have us regard as a mere Scottish testimony No testimony, boss ever is less capable of territorial limitation Christ s headship lies at the foundation of the Church's existence, One is the source of its efficiency It is, therefore, not only incumbent on the Church but also necessary for it, at all times, and in all places and circumstances, to assign and faithfully preserve to the decline of the headship its proper place and prominence, A Church that dislodges this doctrine from its testimony, and puts it under a bushel, cannot svariantly expect that Christ, in the exercise of this headship, will honour and help it His dealings with it will be for more likely to verify the declaration-" If sso done him, He also ssilldenyus" 2nd Time ii 12 At the close of this address, the Moderator-who had in the meantime ornved- constituted the Synod The following members were in attendance Allan McIntyre (Moderator), William McIntyre James M'Culloch, Colin R Greig, William S Donald, Duncan McInnes, ministers, and Peter Stewart, Samuel

following report -"During the past twelve months Mr Stuart prosecuted his studies with great assiduity, and made satisfactory progress During the earlier part of the year he studied logic, using ' Whately's Logic ' as a text book, and moral philosophy, using Was land's 'Moral Science' as a textbook, and, during the latter part of if, Gi oak and Church Elliston During the whole period he Fludicd

A minister, who laboured for years with great acceptance as a minister of the Free Church in Scotland, formally connected himself with our Church in course of the past year, after calm and mature consideration The committee refers to your esteemed Moderator, the Rev William S Donald A considerable time ago Mr John M'Leod, a student of theology in connection with the Union Church in 'N letona, feeling that his objections to the position of that Church would not permit him to labour in cornice lion with it, expressed a desire to be received as a student by This Church. The convenor of the committee, having satisfied himself that Mr M'Leod was a promising student, encouraged him to come to Sydney to prosecute his studies This he accordingly did, and, from the time of his omvU, Bludied along with Mr Stuart Y with great diligence and with satisfactory results Another promising young man, who has made considerable progress in preparatory studies, has offered himself as a student ' The Synod adopted this report, and resolved to take Mr M'Leod on trials for license The attention of the Synod having been directed anew to the difficulty encountered by congregations in procuring sites from the Government, a committee was appointed to procure for this Church a recognition of its rights by the Government In the evening Mr Stuart was taken on trials, and examined in G nek, theology and Church history and after engaging in prayer, read a sermon on the text formerly Bpeciiicd-Ephesians, n 8 The Synod then engaged in devotional exercises, conducted by the Moderator and the Rev Allan McIntyre The Synod met on Thursday forenoon, when Mr. Mel cod was taken on trials, and underwent an examination similar to that already described as undergone by Mr Stuart In the evening the Synod resumed the Let Us of Mr Stuart and Mr M'Leod, when the former read a popular lecture on John xv I 8, and the latter a sermon on FihcsiaBB n 10, and a lecture on John xix 1-7 On I day forenoon the Synod resumed the trials of Mr Stuart and Mr M'Leod, and examined them on inspirations The Synod then, taking a conjunct view of their trials, regarded them as satisfactory, and resolved to license Mr Stuart and Mr M'Leod at a future diet A committee to correspond with sister Churches was appointed In the evening, Mr Stuart and Mr M'Leod, having satisfactorily answered the questions put to probationers, and having signed the formula, were licensed to preach the Gospel and to exercise their gifts as probationers for the Hill Ministry, and were addressed in appropriate and in pressive terms by the Moderator On the suggestion of the Treasurer, the Synod directed deacons courts and committees of management, to make full and detailed returns to the Treasurer on or before the 30th April and the 6th October, each year, of all the money collected for religious or charitable purposes, whether expended under the direction of the Synod or that of deacons courts or committees On Monday, a committee, consisting of the Moderator, Mr Greig, Mr W M'Intyre, and Mr M'Culloch Mr Greig, convener, was appointed to make any further arrangements that may appear desirable with respect to the studies and the examination of candidates for the ministry In the evening, the Treasurer read the financial report, which was unanimously adopted.
