Was it a Ghost they saw? MRS. H. H. JES'NINOS live6 at No. 211 Mainstreet, Bridgeport, and Miss Minnie Parrot boards with her. The house i« an old one, but in good order. One night eatly in December, 1891, the two women locked all the doors and went to the theatre, leaving not a soul in the house. They left the gas burning, however, in the front parlour. At about half ^-past eleven they returned, and entered tbe house langhing and talking. But as they went into the parlonr the merry humour died out of them in a second, flight in the middle of tbe room stood a dark man of gigantic stature. .The upper part of his face was concealed by a mask, his eyes gleaming through the eyeholes in it. His shirtsleeves were. rolled up, and in one band he curtied a long, old-fashioned pistol. The' woken fled sci earning from tbe room, and when „r T. . - „ , , '6it--.Hfism Mr. Jennings canto i^ avn^minutesJatv^ft. ,,.<4 found no one in fhr |i<tr:oui'»iod all uie doors ' BDd wiridowB securely l .cht-.d.

Ghosts come from the inside of tbe person who sires them, and when Mother Seigel'a Syrup does it work, ti.e eyes and ears entertain only what is natural and wholesome.
