A AHrOM CEOF THE- DEEP. 'I dreamt a dream t w ot all a dam.' B' W" r'.C i. RauSEMLL CH... APT XXIX'-T T?iUTe. SThedisland stood plaiti ihths powertfar ene of the glass.- The tremble of the anf a 'the buse was visible, 'a thin white throbbing vein that gave tha island the appearance 'of. mirage by the sarls suggestion of: clear spaa betwnz ;the shore and the sea;, It. was still blue in the blue' atmosphere, with a fbrine fringing of trees in places ; and the two hills and the graceful. arching over anto the water of the notth- western point of thedlnd with theesetern crrve,' made its resemblance to a camel standing to its belly in' the water, with its head under, as startling in its queer accu. racy as a face in the fire or some wild likeness in a clo id. 'The moment Forteesene had is loll, a swimming and a faintness chilled his brain ; he shut his eyes. but, with less effort than before, rallied and levelled the'telescope afresh. As the lineaments of the land came out tremulous upon the azure, an overwhelm tog emotion of awe and dread and' wonder pbeseeeed him. Taar was the island of his vision ?' What acency but the hand of God had painted in its complete colonresupon the eye of hid slumbering soul that little space of land yonder .tha had been unknown to him as any valley, grove, or.mountain top in the brightest of the planets I It was like being brought close'to the spirit of God to behold that manifestation of His holy guiding ::to survey in "its realisation the gleaming visionary 'object he had marked the darling of his heart appealing to him from. Hed there been nothing of humas tenderniess, of humangrief, of biman yearning and'passion in this revelation; there would have been too much of mestery, of high supersiaturalsm in it for the mind of Forteecue to support in his then state of health. Bt there was Agatha to think of. The motive, the issue of the voyage, became an absorbing thought;. re. moving him from the perils' of the great awe which the profounder sense of.thes act of Divine disclosure would have begotten in him. ' 'Wasshe on'the island ? 'Would she be livingor dead? ' Dear God IL' he cried in his heart, and his eye turned blind' against the glass as.his soul came to his lips -in prayer. When the schooner was within two and a half miles of the island they took a cast st the lead, but no bottom was found. Soon afterwards the larger of the boats was got over and towed anstern, and the strnneaile taken ib. A gaze as searching anu intent as ever shipwrecked marinerslevelled from rock to ri?ginit at the sea was fixed by the crew of the Golden Hope upon the island; but not to their saked eyes noryet to the glasses which Hiram and Stone directed at the land was there visible the least sign of anyone being alive there. No smoke rose to'the wind, no rag nor' signal flattered. In the glornoos morning sunrishine veering northerly, each small eminence threw its blue-black shadow south -west ; off the surface of cocoanut trees rose a silvery 'greenish gleam that had the fluctuating iridescence of oil and water, as the breeze trembled in the foliage, and the setting or the little island in the pure azure of the deep, vivid and beautiful as it was with rich tropical tints of vegetation, of bush, of long grass, of sward-like slopes, of the shadows of accli'ities, of the chequered brightness of corals'and, was accentuated in a'manner that from the distance of the schooner rave the picture a em-like emerald loveliness by the heaping of the white surf along the waidward leugth of it, a boiling of breakers that had she dazz e of a mass of drifted snow. , Now that theisland was made:one saw the relief in Hiram and Stone. The correctness of the captain's navigation on the one side. the vindication of the mate's solemn state. ment on the other, were a satisfaction to these two plain sailors that no wonder nor doubts as to what was next to happen could at all impair. ' We've :done- what we was asked to do, what was expected of us, Bill,' Hiram said; and that one or t'other of us is out by twenoty or thirty 'mile, means nothen, seein' as there it is, straight ahead,.as if we had been warned to it from the other, side of the airth." But consider-only consider-if' we'd ha' passed it out o" sight from yon masehead ! We might have found it ny cruisin' about-and we mightn't-and if we hadn't, you'd ha been thought a liar, and I'd li' been thought incapable of trulynavigating a craft. Taere'd been. rows art-r, and a re 'lar bloomio' muddle, whilst its to triai--' and he nodded twanrd. F -rte.cue with an extravagant shrug of the'shoolders. . But if the feeling of relief and'gratifinetion wa lively and lasting,';it was soon sunordi. nited:for the time to an intense .perfectly natoral curiosity as 'to whether 'the lergy. man's extraordinary dream was to be com pletely confirmed by the discovery of the lady, or whether the island, by its desolation, wee to couvert the whole voasge into a piece of wild, worthless, sheer superstition. As the spot of land drew more and more within the scope o the eyes fixed ' uon it, the' crew assembled in 'the bowe, and standing-by for orders. whispered among themselves. The cheer they had given was not one they would have reosated in tnsir present mood. It was true the island lay solid and surf- beaten-an actual fact that the most nervou-lr imagi native eye could not convert hnto a fantasy ; but-it was something that had been seen thousands of miles off in avision, and there foreto be viewed with'awe and" supersitious 'cee.ping, as "old Breechese imolted 'whe;h. giving his trousers a drag up and spitting over the idei' There's nothing in it that', onnatural, I've seen' the lires of suech islerands ecores of times; hot I don't mind owoin' that I wouldn't take the walne of a gentleman's house ashore, to sleep alone for one night on it. If ye' was to tell me Id see a ghost I'd go; if ye was to tell me the devil was in bidin' there I'd go. There's nothing as I coaid feel cocksure on as 'td. stop me. But when' there's no one to say what a man might see, or whas might happen to him, awaller my eyeballs, Micky, if a chap's to he called afeerd for keepin' to windward of the moonshine in sitch a quarter.' Of course, the c ok took the same view; and:.through the atmosphere of such talk as-. this the ignorant,- noerestitions,- bur hearty,. ,lively sailors watched the islaud growig-L' After Fortescue had satisfied him self that there was nothing to be seen.on shore indias tive of the presence of human beings, he stood watching and waitingeoithout speech ; but nobody' could have .glaticed at him without witnessing the formidable confliet of emotions that was being waged within him.

A dog must have two tails afore-he feels too proud to obey horders,' walked to the gangwy, and wa followed.by young Jae Hall. In a few moments the boat was pullingaway towards the island. Porteecue in the stern aheete and old Stone working away as stroke, looking over his saholder to get the boat'se head fair for the point it was necessary to-round, It would behard if no answer was e7er re turned to the prayers which men in sufferiug put up to God. It is so natural to lift ap the heart and the hand to Heaven when help, forgivene"e, solace, strength are needed that the instinct of intuilion which prompts- the gesture and the, whisper is one of the profoundest a?ao rances we posseae that, the soul that rises with us s a star that ' cometh from afar.' and 'from God who is our home.' The sudden strength,. neive, power, let it be cailed what it will: that had communicated \- a-nse of iron resolution to Fortescue'a miud, enfeebled by a hundred distracting emotions, made dangerous by the dark shadow of the special supernaturalism of the last momenta of the outward passage, must have.bmea ao anewer to his appeal. .

Why,it was enough so shake him to the very centre of his being merely to kow, by seeing the island itself, how vivid, .byond all Fosible-capacity ol the mind's mechaniam,.unaided by direct revelation, was the vision he nad beheld in his alumber at Wrloe- He was measnrino now the identiclt spaes of waters be had seen the boat that contained- Agatha passing over Was she there?: Amid that boiling whitenese yonder the boat had'goneto pieces, and through that same thunderous surf ohe had been dragged by an heroic hand. and joet beyond it she had kneeled, then rose, and yearned for him with extended- arms and a face fall of the inexpressible angursh of a hopeless spirit. He had seen it all, though the mere thought of the infinite leauues that separated him from the spot where this scene f flashing ocean .and pouring uen, and ver dautisland had rien before- hi sealed eyes wrenched him with the.wondetfalneso of it like a heartehudder. Was she there?: Oh! surely themerciful God -would not have led him thus far for no purpose. -For sheer relief he turned' his eyebÂ»als, aching -from the strain of' the intensely searching gaze he fixed upon- the island, to the schooner-the heautiful scho-ner--the noble, staunch, auspiciously named Golden Hope; and the clear reflection of her ap pearance came like a soothing greeting to him as tor a moment or two he marked her awaying upon the flating heaving of the deo.'with a little windy rushionof fingerlike shadows over h-r whire ails,% and fasbings in the brimming blue liqud: brows trom the starry radiance kindled in her; wet sides by the sunshine, and the heads of the crew lilipotianised by distance,. looking at the receding boat over the rail. : The men pulled steadily ;.Stone vary grave, with. oecasional side qmunts at F.rteecee. and prolInted looks over his shoulder at the island.

At last old Stone, bringing his eyes away from the land, and staring nnder twisted eyebrows puat Forteeeue at the sea, muttered with a deep sigh or two SIHsilgho I heigho ! here, it wa, William, that I was that dry for drink I whuld have swapped the mother that bore me for a qnar ter of a pint of water.

'How long it 'I be, Mr. Stone, since them we've come to fetch haebin cast awa ?' asked Hall. ''Nine months, Joe, nine months,' re 'iponded Stone, with something of deprec*. 'ion io hi manner, evidently considering the qunstron mal apropoe. and neasking with ingular solemnity. Then, addressing Mr Forteane, *'IF thes's any persons ashore there. sir, they'll have to be behind' them hamps.
