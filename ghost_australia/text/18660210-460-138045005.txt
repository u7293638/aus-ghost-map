antipodes would be represented1 at Newmarket, at America aud continental Europe have been; but, iritb all deference to thoee who differ from me at to the general custom of long distance races being the staple of our meet ings, I shall still believe that the over-oulti vetiou of the quality of speed it in a mew sirs done at the expense of the higher faculty of staring at racing pace orer three or four mime. * * We pay too much attention to the flying powers of an animal, that are bounded ' by a Ore-furlonga apin; we estimate thit (as I think) minor ezodlenoe too liigbly. Of courrc every one knows, and it needs no ghost to tell us, that of many marca none may over produoe a three milee racer; animals of the first olasa of this sort era rare | but my opinion is, that mams that have after a sufficient trial shown that their slock oan only get as for aa a mile, bare no business to occupy a plane in any of our auperior breeding stoat. It mutt be ex pected that, while our racing ayttem en courages chiefly the one quality of speed, and tneaturet that rather over short distances than orer long ones, breeder! will be lees care ful what youDg stock they get, always pro vided they show speed over some distanoe, be it long or short. But I think that, not in a liuny, nor with a hasty disposition to undo present arrangements, howerer faulty, we ought gradually and steadily to revert rather to what was the racing " on the English plan" at the date or the preface I have quoted, than to the flying handicap, hurry-scurry, and helter-skelter system, that has, in the opinion of many better judges than myself, been very injurious to the maintenance of the proudest and most valuable qualities of the English thoroughbred bone.
