A WISH CUCKOO. THE cuckoo has. arrived in this íüighbourhood. I heard his wander ng voice, like that of." it ghost, brough the woods, a fortnight or liare ago. If you have heard him, or f ybu «re listening for him, you will appreciate this story. "You have just come, my friend, and do not know what I do," said, a wolf ono day toa cuckoo. " I am sure if you-did you would not haye.taken tho trou- ble to arrive. "...For;;my part, I,am sick to death of the spiteful ways of men and dogs, even an angel would have to light if,he lived amongst them. I'm off, so good-bye." Cuc- koo: "Wait a bit,; tell me where is, ¡thc land you aro going to? Surely^ a long way * oif it wolves and rn en dwell. together there. in peace." " I |am going to Arcadia, that1 is the place for. me," said?; tho .'wolf ;?,:" the people there are mild as lambs, the rivers run with milk instead of water, and dogs neither ;bark nor bite. I hope to live out my days among them in ease aud. comfort, and not be worried to death ,as I am here." "Joy go'with you, and: h.. pleasant journey to . you ! But what about those teeth of yours, and your own habits and customs, do you take rtfem with 'yöu, '0r leávó them be- hind?" "Leave thom behind, indeed,'V"grinned :.thei,wqlf,i" not if I know it, my teeth and my ways go with me." "Then you may just as well stáy where you- are, for ns long as yon behave like a wolf men will treat you Uko one, even in Arcadia. If you want men to be kind and good to you, you must be kind and good to them." That was a very wise cuc- koo, and I think there.is a great deal even you young' folks may profit' by in the advice, he gave the wolf. Bvery time you.hear the cuckoo's note this spi- ing, think of this, will you ? ? ? -I
