THE WHITE SEAL. BY RUDYARD KIPLING. IN TWO PARTS. PART I. All these things happened several years ago at a place called NOA astonish, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and away in the Behring Sea. Liniuiershin the winter wren told me the tale when he w ng blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I took him down into my cabin and warmed him and fed him for a couple of days, till he was fit to fly back to St. Paul's again Limmershm is a very quaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people who have business there are the seals They come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold grey sea, for Nov astonish beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world Sea Catch Knew that, and every spring he would swim from whatever place he happened to be in-would swim like a torpedo boat straight for Nov astonish, and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was 13 years old, a huge grey fur seal with almost a mane on his shoulders and long w wicked dog teeth When he heaved himself upon his front flippers he stood more than 4ft. clear of the ground, and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly 7lH)lb He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights, but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head on one side as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face, then he would shoot it out Like lightning, and when the big teeth were firm fixed in the other seal s neck the other Beal might get away if he could, but Sea Catch would not help him. Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten sea!, for that was against the rules of the beach He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery, but as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals all hunting for the same thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach was something fright fall from a little bill called Hutchinson s Hill you could look over three miles and a half of ground covered with fighting seals, and the surf was dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their share of fighting They fought in the breakers, they fought in the sand, and they fought on the smooth worn basalt rocks of the nurseries, for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men Their wives never came to the island till late in May or early in June, for they didn't care to be torn to pieces, and the young two, three, and four year old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters, and played about on the sand-dunes in. droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing that grew. They were called the hon luschickie-the bachelors-and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah alone Sea Catch had just settled his forty fifth fight one spring when Matkab, his soft, sleek, gentle eyes wife come up out of the sea, and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his rescue tion, saying, gruffly, " Late as usual ; where have you been It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything at all during the four months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad. Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed, " How thoughtful of you ' "ion We taken the old place again I should think I had," said Sea Catch, "Look at me!" He was scratched and bleeding in twenty places One eye was almost out, and his sides were torn to ribbons. "Oh, you men, you men!' Matkah said, fanning herself with a hand flipper. " Why can't you be sensible and settle your places quietly ' You look as though you had been fighting with the killer whale " " I haven't been doing anything but fight Since the middle of May. The beach is disgracefully crowded this season. I've met at least a hundred seals from Lukannon beach, house hunting. Why can't people stay where they belong i " I've often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter Island in Stead of this crowded place," said Matkah. " Bah 1 only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they would say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, Wy dear. ' Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended to go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he kept a sharp look out for a fight Now that all the seals and their wives were on land you could hear their clamour miles out to sea above the loudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals on the beach-old years, mother seals, tiny babies and holluschickie, fighting, scuffling, Jbleating, crawling, and playing together going down to the sea and coming up from it in, gangs and regiments, lying over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach and skirmishing about in brigades through the fog It is nearly always foggy at Novas Rosanah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look all pearly and rain Ibow-colonreu for a little while Kotick, Matkah a baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he was all head and shoulders, with pale watery blue eyes, as tiny seals must be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother look at him very closely. " Sea Catch," she said at last, " our baby's going to be white ! ' "Empty clam shells and dried Sea weed ' [Snorted Sea Catch " There never has been such a thing in the world as a white peal " " I can't help that," said Matkah, " there's going to be now, and she sang the low crooning seal song that all mother seats sing to their babies - You mustn't swim till you reW weeks old Or your head will be sunk by your heels, And summer gales and Killer whales Are bad for baby seals Of course the little fellow did not under Stand the words at first He paddled and scrambled about by his mother's side, and learned to scuffle out of the way when his father was fighting with another Beal, and the two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was only led once in two days, but then he ate all he could, and throve upon it. The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like puppies, went to sleep on the Band, and played again. The old people on the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie kept to their own group Ida, and the babies had a beautiful time. When "Marks came back from her deep sea fishing she would go straight to their play ground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait till she heard Kotick bleat Then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers, and knocking the journalists head over heels right and left There were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the play grounds, and the babies were kept lively but as Matkah told Kotick, "So long as you don't he in muddy water and get mange, or get the hard sand into a cut or scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy sea on, nothing will hurt you ' Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy till they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave carried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song, and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned After that be learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always kept in sleepers for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks learning to use his flippers, and all 44 third time he floundered in and out of the water, and laughed, and granted, and crawled up the bench, and took straps on the sand and went back again, till it last he found that he belonged in the water O, then you can imitate the times that he had with his companions, ducking under the rollers, or coming in on the top of a comber, and binding with a swash and a splutter as the big wine went whirling far up the bench or standing upon his tail and Borntchmg him he vd as the old people did, or playing I'm the King of the Castle on Slippery I need rocks that just stuck out of the water Now and then he would see a thin for like a big shark s for, drifting along close to shore and he knew that that was the killed whole the Grampus-who cats young teal'' when he can get them and Kottck would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin would move away slowly as if it were looking for nothing at all Late in October the seals began to leave St Paul s for the deep Beaby families and tribes, and this was no more fighting over the nurseries, and the hollusohickie plateau where the) liked. " Next ) ear," said Matlcah to Kottck, "you will he ft hollusclnck, but this)ear)ou must learn how tocttchlish ' They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkih showed Kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of water No cradle is so comfortable as the long rocking swell of the Pacific When Kottck felt his as in single all over, Matknh told him he was learning the feel of the water, and that tingly prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard and get away from it In a little time,' she said, "you to know where to swim to, but just now well follow Sea Pig, for he is very w use " A shoal of porpoises were duel ing and tear ing through the water, and little Kotick for lowed them RB fast as he could "How do you know where to go' Ire panted. The leader of the shoal rolled his white eye and ducked under " My tail! tingles, ) youngster,' he said " That means there a a gale behind me Come along When you're south of the sticks water (he meant the equator), and your tail singles, that means there's a gale in front of )ou,und)ou must head north Come along The water feels bad here" This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was away s learning Matlcah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the under sea banks and w reach the rocking out of his hole among the weeds, how to skirt the w reef is lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart like a rifle bullet into one port hole and out at another 03 The fishes ran , how to dance on the tops of the waves when the lightning was racing all over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy tailed albatross and the man of war Hawk as they went down wind , how to jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers close to the side and tail curved to leave the flying fish alone because they are all sorry to take the shoulder piece out of a cod at full speed 10 fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a ship-but particularly a row boat At the end of six months what Kotick did not know about deep sea fishing was not worth the knowing, and all that time he never set flipper on dry ground. One day however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water somewhere off the island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah, 7,000 miles away, the games that his companions played and the smell of the seaweed, the seal roar and the fighting That very minute he turned north, swimming steadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for the same place and they said, "Greeting ' Kotick! This year we are all holluschickie, and we can dance the fire dance in the breakers off Lukannon, and play on the new grass, But, where did you get that coat ' ' Kotick s fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of it he only said, " Swim quickly ! My bones are aching for the land ' And they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist That night Kotick danced the fire dance with the Yearling seals The sea is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Nova»toshnah to Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and Btv iris Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds, and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat, and told stories of what they had done while they had been at sea The) talked about the Pacific us boys talk about a wood that they have been putting in, and if any one had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart of that ocean as never was Then the three and four year old hol! lisch tickle romped down from Hutchinson's hill crying Onto the way, youngsters' The sia is deep and you dont know all that is in it ) yet Wait till you we rounded the Horn Iii you yearlings Where did you get that white coat " I didn't get it said Kotick, " it grew and just as he was going to roll the speaker over a couple of black haired men with flat red faces came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man before, coughed and spat and lowered his head The holluschickie just bundled off a few ) yards and sat staring stupidly The men were no less than Kerick Bootenn, the first chief of the seal hunters on the island, and Patalamon, his son The) came from the little village not half a mile from the seal nurseries and they were deciding what seals they should drive up to the killing pens for the seals were driven just like sheep to be turned into sealskin jackets later on "He' said Patalamou "Look! there is a white seal i Kerick Bootenn turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was an Alert, and Aleuts are not clean people Then he began to mutter a prayer "Don't touch him, Patalamon There has never been a white seal since Since I was born Perhaps it is old/aharrofs ghost, he was lost last year in the big gale ' I'm not going near him,' said Patalamon "Iles unluck) Do you really think he is old debarred come back' I owe him for some gulls eggs Don't look at him ' said Kerick " Head off that drove of four year olds The men ought to skin 200 to day) but its the beginning of the season, and they are new to the work A hundred will do Quick ' ' Patalamon rattled a pair of seal s shoulder blades in front of a herd of liollunchickie, and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing Then he stepped near, and the seals began to move, and Kcnch headed them inland, and they never tried to get back to their companions Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went on playing just the same Kotick was the only one who asked questions, and none of his companions could tell him anything except that the men alwayS drove seals in that way for six weeks of every year " I am going to follow, he said, and his Oes nearly popped out of his head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd ' I lie white seal is coming after us, cried Patalamon "That's the first time a seal has ever come to the killing grounds alone ' Ifush Don't look behind yOU, ' said Kerick "It s Maharatta ghost' I must speak to the priest about this IhedriM to the killing ground was only half a mile, but it took an hour, because if the Beats went too fast Kinch knew that they would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when the) were skinned So they went on a slowly, past Sea Lion a jack, past 2 ibster house, till they came to the boat-house, just beyond the sight of the seals on he beach Kotick followed, panting and wondering He thought that he was at the world's end, but the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch, and letthediove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the fog dew dripping off the brim of his cap Then ten or twelve men, each with an iron bound club, 3ft or 4ft long, came up, and Kerick pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten or too hot and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots, made of a walrus a throat and then Kirick said, "Let go, and the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could. The minutes later little Kotick did not recognise his friends any more, for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers -whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile That was enough for Kotick He turned and galloped a seal can gallop very swiftly for a short time back to the sea, his little new moustache bristling with honor,
