IS LEO TTTTT HS1TMIDATED 1 It is amusing to read in the English, Swiss, and German newspapers the extraordinary statements anent Leo XIII., furnished by tbe iioman corres pondents, whose, only aooess to the Vatican is through the columns of that veracious newspaper, VltatU. According to them, when the Pope is not in actnal fear of poisonine, he is drawn aside from the paths of political rectitude by the Jesuits who surround him — by the Jesuit Cardinals, &x.; Leo would make friends with. Germany, Italy, and. indeed' all the world, .but for these myste rious eooiesioBtioa, who are about as substantial as Mrs. Batdiffe's ghosts. There is no use in being a correspondent unless you ran supply some eort of copy ; but I wish the Boman correspondents would remember .a few things ?when they expect thdnnch-balieving newspaper isaiere to believe their interesting- newspaper romances'. Among these things \o De remembered are the facts that there are no Jesuit cardinals about the Vatican at, all, and that, so far from fearing the Jesuits, Leo XIII. is exceedingly fond of that ecclesiastical order. The Jesuits educated him as a boy and man; they led him to the flues* hold of his ecclesiastical career ; they secured for him the appreciation of Gregory XVI., and, but for them, in abort, Leo would never have bad a chance of the pontifical chair. As regards Italy, Leo never was a ModeratiBt. From the day the Italians occupied Perugia to the -J«y he suawedtd Wo Nono.OardinaiPecci, Bishop of Perugia, never recognised the Italian Governmsnt. He wrote pastorals aWinrtH, and Sever suffered one of. tie officiate of the Italian 'State to' enter his presence. He was less yielding than even Pip Kono, for tht Cardinal Facci never did. Leo Xlll.ia an experi enced diplomatist; but an unyielding, teBause an enthusiastic, churohjnan. ?'?'?:
