Suddenly, however, there was comparative silence. One voice only was heard, and that was the Egyptian's. 'Yes,' he was saying, 'I am what is called a euperstiQotts man. I believe in dreams, visions, and returned spirits of the dead. But, ah! I do hot believe jn made-up ghosts.- Oh. you cold-blooded English people, don't mis take the impulsive Egyptian; don't accuse him of lack of faith in the unseen. So much do I believe in it, that sometimes I long to be jwlih tliQiserwho hajj gqne. ; iJJjit, bah! the 'ghost' 'last 'night was to deceive,' to. frighten^ Got up by some Yillajn for a purpoje, and I can guess who he is.' ... -.. . ? ''This is serious,' eajd Tdtn Temple. 'I have inquired of the servants, who all assure me of their entire ignorance of the matter, and I cannot think that any of my guests wouid assume the person of the traditional ghost for no other purpose than to frighten the housekeeper and two or three servants. I'm by no means .superstitious, but I do not see how I can trace it to human origin.' 'I cannot see why any; guest should assume the person of the traditional ghost, but some men have deep designing minds. They are like clever draught-players; they' see, half a dozen moves ahead, and so do that which to a novice appears meaningless and absurd.' Then I heard another voice, one that caused my 'heart to beat, wildly. It was Gertrude Forrest's. 'Mr. Kaffar says he can guess who the person is who has personated this ghost;' she said; 'I think it fair to every guest that he should speak out.'v_- ?':_, ?':. y ,. 'I would not; like to say,' he said insult ingly; 'perchance I should wound your ten der feelings too deeply.' : 'Mr. Kaffar will remember he's speaking. :to a lady, I'm sure,' said Tom Temple. 'Pardon me,v «aid Kaffar, excitedly; 'I for got I was in England, where men are . the slaves of the ladies. ? With us it is different. We speak and they obey. ;?

' 'Quietly, please,' I replied. *'You did come to me this morning with some foolish jargon about my being connected with last night's affair, but I was so surprised Jjy the absurdi ty and foolishness of such a thing, that I could not answer you before you ran away.' . 'You hear?' shrieked. ±he Egyptian. , 'So surprised, was he? Jf-he±wm, it was be cause I had found him out'-: 'This man is mad,' I said. 'Surely he ought to be shut up.' 'Mad, am I?'! he shrieked. 'Xes, and you are a liar, a coward, a vUlainJ You are en gaged in~a fiendish plot; yon are deceiving an ?Innocent lady. Ah, I spurn you, spit upon you.' . 'Mr.. Kaffar,' said Tom Temple, 'really this cannot be: allowed. You; must remember you are among. gentlemen and ladies. Please act accordingly.' ''Ladies there ar£ gentlemen thei?e &ae;,' shrieked the ggyjjtian.; '%4t Hie''— pointing at me— 'is no gentlenian. He i& aFoncea viper, a villain, and a coward. I leave this house; I renounce pleasant society; I leave this --oun- \- try— for ever; but before I go I would like to fight hand to hand .with that giant, ? Ha!' He stood close to me and spat at me. 'There!' he- cried, and tbenihe struck me in the face with all hie strength. Instantly I leapt to' my' feet This Insult was too great. I could scatafely restrain from striking him to the grpnna.f:| mastered' my eelf, however; and so did ndt^touch him. 'I leave this house/-* he said, Mildly. 'Herod, send on my baggage to Cairo.

But, bah! you. daren't -fight You' are a mooning coward!'.;. ... . , He rushed out of the Toom as he spoke, and a minute later I heard the hall door, slammed with vehemence. . At that moment I became possessed of a terrible passion. - I seemed to be -mad. I longed to avenge the insults that Dad been offered.

Again I realised my exidtenc«: in a vague ehadowy way. I stppi. beneath*,, the. ruined walls of ah Ea6tem|emple,;:Hdge columns arosi in the air, surmounted by cojbssal archi traves, while \the ponderous stones of wliichv; tfle-: temple was built .^sm covered with? lichen. Large grey lizards v crawled to and out among the «revio^??if ^the rooks, and seemed to |augh as they sported amidst -what was xmce^tUe re$pres8ion of a great religious system, but which was aow- terrible in its weird desolation. By-and-by the-great build* ing -seemed to assume its original shape and became inhabited by white-robed priests^ who ministered to the people, who came to wor ship., I watched eagerly, but they faded e^ay, leaving nothing save the feeling that a terrible: presence filled the place. -I heard a noise behind; I turned and jsaw Kaffar, his black eyes shining,. while in his hand l*e held a gleaming knife. He lifted it above his head as if- to strike; but I had the strength of ten men, and I hurled him from me. He j looked at me with a savage, leer. 'Onward!' eaid a distant voice. ' The 'tempfe vanished, and with It all my realisation of life, save a vague fancy that I j was moving somewhere, I knew not where. *?:????. . * / * I stood by a well-remembered spot I was by the side of Drearwater Pond. Around me Was a stretch of common land, on which grew heather ~~ and' furze. In front of me were noiseless waters, a dismal sight at the best of times, but awful as I .saw them. Across the pond in the near distance loomed the dark fir trees. No sound broke the still ness of the night. The wind had gone to rest, the moon shone dimly from behind the misty clouds. .,.„ - .. .. ,-:. /.. i ? j:--..: .i I stood alone. * ' Each mhiute my surroundings .'became more: real. I recognised more clearly the objects which had struck me during my first visit, while the stories which had been told came back to me with terrible distinctness. I .re membered how it had been said .that the pond had no bottom, 'and, that it Was haunted by the spirits of those that had been murdered. The story of its evil influence eaine ba.dk.' to, me, and: in my bewildered condition I won^ dered whether there was not some truth in what had been said. What was that? : ' The waters, moved; distinctly moved, near to where I stood,. and from their dark; .depths something appeared— I could not at first tell what. What could It be?' A monster of frightful mien? . The ghost of some murdered man or woman?- I could have believed in either juet then. It was neither. ? What then? . A iurnan hand, large and shapely, appeared distinctly- on the surface of the pond. No thing more, not even the wrist to which it might be attached. It did not beckon, or in deed move at all; it was as still as the hand of death. - -. ? I stood motionless and watched, while the outline of the hand became more clear; then I gave an awful shudder'. ' The hand was red! I gave a shriek, and for a time remembered nothing more. * * * * I awoke to consciousness, fighting. At first it seemed as if I was fighting with a phan tom, but gradually my opponent became more real to me. It was Kaffar. I had only a dim, hazy idea of what I was doing, except that I sought to wrest from his. hand a knife. We clutched each other savagely, and wrestled there on the edge of the pond. Weights seemed to hang upon my limbs, but I , felt the stronger of the two. Gradually I knew I was mastering him— then all was blank. * ? ? * * ? A sound of voices. A flash of light. A feeling of freedom, and I was awake! Where? Still by Drearwater Pond. No phantoms, no shadow, nothing unreal, save the memory of tbat which I have but dimly described. That was but- as a terrible nightmare— an aw ful dream. Where was Kaffar? : I could not telL Certainly he was not near; but two other forms stood by me, one bearing a lantern. 'Is it you, Justin?' said a voice. 'It is L Tom,' I said, looking vacantly around. . ; 'And where is Kaffar?' said another voice, which I recognised as Voltaire's. 'Kaffar? I-^I do not know*' 'But you have been together.', 'Have we?' I said vacantly. ?; 'You know you have. What is that in your hand?' I ihad scarcely known what I had been gay ing or doing up to this time, but as be spoke I looked at my hand. ' In. the light of . the moon I eaw a knife red with blood, and my hand, too, was also dis colored. 'What does this mean?' cried 'Voltaire. 'I do not : know. I ajn dazed— be wlldered.' 'But that is Saffar's knife. ? I ioipiv; he had it this very evening. W-ere is Kaffar now?' , 'Is it true?' I remember saying. 'Have we been together?' 'That's ihia knife, at any rate, And what Is this?' Voltaire -picked up ^ometaing' from the ground, and looked at it 'Kaffaa-'s,' he said. 'Look, -Mr. BJaike, do yoii recognise this?' I looked a.nd saw. a finely worked neckcloth, on which was written in Arabic, characters the words, ^'Aba Wady Kaffir.'; If had every appearance of being soiled by severe wrenching, and on it were spots .of blood. My faculties were,; rapidly returning '-to me, yet I etood as one in a dream.- ? 'You say, Mr. Justin Blake, that you do not know where Kaffar is. yet you hold in your hand his knife, which is red wlth-blood. Here Is his scarf,, which has evidently . been (Strain ed, -and on it are spots of blood, while all around are marks indicating a struggle'. ' I say you dp know -what this -meanSj-^and you must tell us.' ' ; , ?I reeled under this terrible 'shock. . What had I done'? Could\ it be that I had mur dered this man? s Had IS Had I? . 'I do not knowi'what it means,7' I said. . 'I think lam- ilL' / ? ' '.'Men. usually are ;iH?nen . they ,hav& done -what you' have,'; he jsaid; '' -'. .': . 'Why, what have, IV done?? I said, in a daaed kind of a wiay. - 'Done!' he repeated.' *Tou know best about that in spite of the part- you play.

COPTER Xn. '-Some- one' was knocking at the door. ^Who's there?' ? ?'. 'Tom Temple.' I sprang out of bed and let Wm. in.

'I suppose Voltaire has told every one the circumstances of last night?' I said at length. 'No.' . ?? -/? ? ??- ' 'No one?' 'No one that will divulge anything. Every one else thinks that Kaffan has gone back to Egypt as he said, and especially- so as Vol taire has been making arrangements for his luggage to be' sent to Cairo.' 'This is astounding.' I do not comprehend in tiie least; but, tell me, who is this some one r to whom ' you or -he''has: related last night's affair, and why was it, done?' 'I dp not know whether I ought Jto teJJL pr no, but. you are an old. friend, and I cannot refuse. After I had come down from, here last night and fancying that every one had retired, for it was quite midnight I, knowing I was too excited to sleep, made my way to the library. I had just reached the dopr when I heard voices. I wondered who. could be up at that time of the night but was not left to remain long In doubt. ' 'Mr. Voltaire,' said a voice, 'you have been out looking for Mr. Blake; have you found him?' ' 'Mr. Blake is safe in bed before this, Misfe Forrest— probably asleep,' was his reply.' ; 'Miss Forrest!' I cried. 'Did she go to him?' i 'Evidently,' replied Tom. 'Indeed, I found out afterwards that she had been very anxi ous. She had seen vou go out, and watched Voltaire and me, who went in search of you, and would not retire until she knew your whereabouts.' 'WelL what then?' 'I went into the room. I could not stand and play the eavesdropper. Miss Forrest seemed very glad to see me, and said eager ly— . ' 1 came down to ask whether you had found Mr. Blake. I am glad he Is safe.' ' 'And he must remain safe!' cried Voltaire. ''Why?' asked Miss Forrest -? ; ' 'Miss Forrest' cried Voltaire vehemently, 'you have been deprived of your rest to-night in order to know about one who is guilty of What you English people call a -foul crime, but which I call a deed that must be avenged.' ' 'I do not understand you.' ' *Ah! Miss Forrest, we Easterns are not like you English people. You are cool and considerate; we are warm and impulsive. Kaffar was not one that could be loved by you cold people; -but I loved Mm. We w.e're more than brothers. I know he was faulty, I know he dared the anger of your English giant but I did not think it would come to this.' ? . .'..../., ' ' 'Come to what?' she asked eagerly. ''?Voltaire;' I said, 'is this quite fair?' ''No, no!' he cried; 'but I am so excited that I can scarcely master myself. I will say no' more.* (To be continued.)
