NOTICE TO CORRESPONDENTS. "W. H. Huntington." — We quite concur in your view of the ''Secular Society," but we doubt the propriety of discussing their blasphemies in our columns; Were we to admit letters in opposition to their doctrines, we should be open to the charge of unfairness were we to refuse their replies. But their replies are not of a kind which could be admitted. When men are so far lost to reason as to believe in "secularism " — so blind as not to see God in creation and providence — and so profane as to speak of Jesus as an "impostor"— they are beneath notice. It is folly to reason with them. Like the famous Infidel who did not believe in a God, but who was afraid to be left in the dark because of ghosts, such miserable ignoramuses are very bold, no doubt, but also very silly.
