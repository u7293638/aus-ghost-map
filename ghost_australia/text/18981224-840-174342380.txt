Midnight Surprise. Hero is a true story which happened to me last Christmas Evo when living in Bath road, Worcester. I was reading a ghost story at midnight, wlion I was suddenly startled by a peculiar creaking noise in tho room. Terror seized me, und I" was just about to ruBh for the door when I received a heavy blow on my head. How long I lay stunhed I do not know, bnt when I recovered, my wife, with half a dozen friends looking on, was bathing my foroheud. My faca wus bruised, and alto gether I must have looked a pitiable sight. On inquiring about tho "ghost," I was told a lurgo pumpkin, whinh hud been hang ing directly over my head, had fallen. Tho bit of tapo that supported it was found nibbled in several places. It seemed a mouse hud gnawed ut it (which accounted for the peculiar noise I heard), until the weight of the pumpkin could not be .supported, and it foil on top of me.
