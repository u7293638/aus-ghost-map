NEWS BY THE MAIL. TOPICS OF THE WEEK. A (FltOSlOuTi ColtltESPONDlUiT.) LONDON, MAY 6. The House of Commons has again been perturbed by The Times allegations against the Parnellites, and by the heated denunciations of The Times by the Irish party The matter crops up at irregular intervals, had always in some new fashion but the initia- tion of the latest phase of the subject (which continues in full blast after three days'' debate) was singular to a degree On the 22nd April Mr John Dillon, speaking in his place in Parliament in answer to a challenge by Lord Hartington, made reference to certain statements of The lanes that he had been in intimate association with 16 J Sheridan, "invincible, dynamiters, and assassin Mr Dillon, using the strongest language in speaking of 'J he 'I times, declared that Sheridan's connection with the constitutional organisation in Ireland ceased upon his arrest, and was never renewed On the 2nd May, alter the lapse of some 10 days, Vie Time returned to the charge with certain declara- tions by Patrick lord and other evidence quite contrary to the language held by Mr Dillon, and wound up the article by asserting that Mr Dillon's statement was a tissue of gross and palpable false heads" This, appearing on Monday, was brought up by way of privilege when the i House met on tuesday Sir Charles Lewis, the latest Conservative baronet, now mern her for North Antrim but better known as the member for Londonderry thought it his duty), spite of the contrary persuasions of the Government was hips, to bring the Parnellites to school The hon. member has never been credited with an unnecessary amount of common sense, but he was BURICH ally far seeing to distinguish his opportunity on this question The Speaker lins of late more than once rule that a case of ern liege was used only when an improper attack was made upon a member for his conduct in the House, and in this way his barred the Irishmen from dealing with The Jim i articles relating to proceedings in Ireland, save by way of reply in debate Now, however, The Times had accused a member of deceiving the House by lying, and The 'Times could be reached fair Charles Lewis, however, saw only half the opportunity -that a question of privilege might be rash d, and further reproach thrown upon the Plan Hues He overlooked the fact that the question being so started, it might be carried to the arbitrament of a select committee of the House, and that the Parnellites, who had shirked going into a court of law, might elect to state their case before such a committee At the outset of Sir Charles s speech the Irishmen were in clined to treat him with decision, being more or less ignorant as to the possibilities but the Government found warned Italy that they had been dragged into a trap It was in no sort their " game to give the Parnellites the opportunity of declaring 2/ie 'Times guilty of a breach of privilege, which must result in some punishment On the contrary, they and their supporters had, for days past, been asserting that it was the obvious duty of the Parnellite" to tune-in 'Iimesmto a court of law, believing of course, That 'lite Times must be victorious with a jury When, therefore, Sir Charles Lewis pompously) announced that he would conclude his speech with a motion, apprehension spread on the 'I treasury bench About the same time the Pur relates began to have all my long that there was a possibility of the proceedings yielding them some benefit By and by Sir Charles concluded his speech, took up 1 he 'J lines to the table, and the extracts he had quoted were solemnly read by the clerk 'Then the hon baronet made the formal motion that the article in question was a breach of the privileges of the House I uni) interpose here to say that Sir I lianes I evv is was inno was angry with 'Jh Jims for its attack upon Mr Dillon, but rather the reverse 'He Junee, which avery soie with him entirely mistakes the poor man, whose object has already been stated The motion having in on thus formally made Mr Dillon rose in his place to Bill that he had no objection to urge to it But he wished to know something as to the course of procedure, when he might make a detailed reply and hinted that he would have to look into various particulars and dates The speaker explained that the House would have to decide for or against the declaratory motion of Sir C Lewis and if it decided for a further motion might bring as many persons to the b of the House for punishment As Mr Dillon Be lined unprepared, the debate could be adjourned to give him time. The hint was enough for the Government, and Mr Smith jumped to his feet to propose an adjournment but being rather too anxious to throw the thing upon Mr Dillon, the latter angrily declared that if the House decided that a breach of privilege had been committed he was now quite prepared to face the newspaper " Mr. Smith saw the false step, and Skilfully suggested that time should be allowed to the House to consider the tenor of Jin 7 wire article in connection with the motion made, for which purpose he proposed an adjournment of the debate Then the full Significance of the situation burst upon the Parnellites, and for a couple of hours or more a In the debate aged within the House. Mr. Healy taunted the Government with being afraid to go forward, and suggested that Sir C Lewis had acted with their connivance, although Mr Smith had previously and! that he was entirely ignorant of the intention to make the motion until he reached the House. Mt Dillon followed, insisting that the charges against him should be brought to an issue forthwith He said deliberately that "the two columns of The J nuc√≠ were bare and ntrnciouscnlumnies and deliberate, malicious and abominable misrepresentations of the truth He did not want time to make a defence, and if the House would bring the responsible representative of The Times to the bar, he (Mr Dillon) would prove him to be as base and cowardly) a far as existed in England ' 1 Excitement rose and increased as the Irishmen rose one after another and enforced the demand made by Mr. Dillon. Mr Sexton passionately alluded to the use made" of the allegations of J In- James by Four 11 Churchill, Mr 1 flour, and others in their public speeches and now, he said, that are not ashamed to place us at further disadvantages tactics of del IJ ' I am game of moral assassination and, he declared been played long enough, till j courted inquiry as public men, and before any committee of the House fairly representing all parties they would soon bring this miserable juggle to an end Mr Justin M Carthy was only a trifle more than, taking opportunity of giving a dog to Mr Smith as a" vendor of libels ' Previously) Mr Courtney) had pleaded for a deliberate consideration of the matter, for the sale of the character of the House," and Lord 11 Churchill had chivalrously) thrown his shield over the Government He told the Irishmen that the House could give them no adequate satisfaction To send the printer of the Times to the clock tower until the end of the session was the utmost of their powers, whilst conviction in a criminal court would be followed with the BIVI rest penal) The Attorney) General backed up this view by saying that if the House declined that a breach of privilege had been comnilttiilpuiiiahuient must follow without 'Tin.

Churchill had made a highly effective plea for the liberty of the press, telling the 1 house that in any contest with the newspapers it must inevitably) get the worst of it, and arguing powerfully for the relevance of the matter to the judges in tribunals is on the previous day, Mr Gladstone intervened in the large of the proceedings, this time to announce to the House that if a division resulted in the defeat of "Sir Charles Lewis a motion he should propose to amend the amendment of the Solicitor General by moving that an in quiry should be made by a select committee into the charge of wilful falsehood made against Mr Dillon Yesterday the House was again entirely occupied with this formidable question J Everybody of course, had read Ila. 7 inn s It idea of the morning in which the objections to a select committee were duly set out One of the main reasons put forward was that the inquiry would be restricted to statements affecting the Parliamentary conduct of members This limit men, it was contended, would not attach to a prosecution for II VI.

Mr Gladstone who moved his amendment to the proposal of the Solicitor General is, now become the main question It may be remarked here that, as the House had deemed against treating the matter as a breach of priv dege the suggestion of send- ing it to a select committee was very seriously discounted in nils since Mr Gladstone however, Linden powerful speech by basing his argument upon the offer to institute a criminal prosecution against Iii I bars the House, he said, had never set the Attorney- General in motion without making itself a party to the proceedings, and he challenged the law advisers of the Government to show that in any of the precedents they had quoted in support of the case a prosecution had been ordered without a previous condemnation by the House of the matter for which the prosecution was ordered 1 Isevvhere Mr Gladstone was guilty of something uncommonly like special pleading he told the House that when he was little commissioner for the Ionian Islands If 'I in st i lunged him with treason, and that when he came home determined to prosecute that journal his solicitors advised him not to go into court From this he nth nut ed the contention that the refusal of the Irish members to go into luurtvvusumpl) justified, and strange to say, insinuated a want of belief in the absolute unpainted) of the judges, for which he was subsequently brought actively to book The Attorney) General, who followed, avoided that stronger part of the case against a public prosecution, blithe asserted with confidence that the house had never appointed a com- mutes in cases of libel " where the libeller ' persisted in his charge, and was prepared to justify it.
