THE POWER THAT MOVED HIM. There was one who told me this story of his father, long years ago. His father and [another able scholar were two of the most brilliant men of the year at Cambridge. I suppose now something like seventy years ago. They finished their college course to gether, coming out two senior scholars of Trinity College. The father's associate said to him : ' I do not believe now that there is any power in the world which oan convince me that there is a God, or that it oan be known.' That was a fine height for walls to be raised against God. In such a spirit as that he finished that portion of f.iifl life's training, thinking himself to be an impregnable fortress, which no power of God oould break down. A little while after taking his degree he was spending some time in a country house. Among the guests came a lady who within a few weeks had lost her husband and three children — the only three she had — at a single blow. She was there in that house, in the presence and company of this atheist, just after the blow had fallen upon her. All knew the story and pitied her for it ; but about that woman there was such an unearthly peace, such an unanswerable calm and presence of God, that the proud man was bowed to the dust, and said to himself: 'There is a God whom 1 do not know.' For weeks he fought against the conviotion, and during those weeks the Spirit of God strove with him, breaking down one by one the. turrets', fortresses, and wall which he had built up, until it brought him — thanks be to God — a humble ohild to the foot of the cross. It was the power of a life filled with the Holy Ghost that broke down the atheism of the most cultured man of his day. — The Christian.
