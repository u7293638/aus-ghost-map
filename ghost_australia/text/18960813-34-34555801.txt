THE NORSEMAN FIELD. [By RANDOPH BEDFORD.] NO.III. The South Norseman district possesses some excellent mines, notably the Onkaparinga, Mount Benson Consolidated, Kirkpatrick Mount Benson, Brown's Mount Benson, and *he Midas, To the south and east of the JXorseman line are the Erl King, Narra coorte, larpeena, Gwendoline. St Albans, 'and Christmas Gift; and to the north the Mary Cater and Mount Barker hues. , sDha Great Boulder Norseman, has a reef heavily impregnated with iron, and m many places showing coarse gold Soma of the ncnest stone m the district lias -come from here. The show mmp? of. this "line of eeef have sq^ far been the Mary Cater -~and 2{arracoorte.

On the south B \- ithess blocks are bounded by an. alluvial flat, n on some good specimens have been lound, and on the Westbylarge ironstone hills. c These peninsula claims exnst in about the only „ tone slate formation "on the Norseman field p The relative coat between working in slate at 21 the peninsula and in dionie at Norseman -* is as £2 to £5 per foot The JDay Dawn a Extended South Company has 24 acres The I! drove north at 20 ft and. cross cut east and west at 14 ft -in the reef. At the time of my visit the eastern wall had been a met, but erosscutting west gave no limit, and P co faf the reef was 12 ft wide of pyntous * and honeycombed quartz and iron, snowing P. fine gold in the vughs. _ One of the chief retarding agencies of pro- n gress on this field has been the dummvmg of P leases and the dummying of men. Two enter- ? prising gentlemen pegged out the whole of the f unclaimed and likely portions of the Pemn tula with no intention of observing the labor n conditions, and merely aiming to keep other men off Other men workmg on ffls.iTnq -where lax management is the rule take their wages it regularly from the owners and work on httle v private shows of their own. This 13 doubly rt unfair—unjust to the owners who pay wages p without receiving any work, and unjust to the prospectors who travel looking for country and p -' are kept off unclaimed ground. The" pro fessional jumper is deservedly an of o Ecorn, and the " dummy" immeasurably worse. I saw an advertisement which would hardly be accepted by s judge as sufficient evidence to prove the publication of a libel Th the centre ? of a scrub bait, almost hidden by large iron blows, we happened on a placard on a tree. " It said, "Wanted two miners^ apply Blank's store, Norseman " Norseman is 22jmles from here.
