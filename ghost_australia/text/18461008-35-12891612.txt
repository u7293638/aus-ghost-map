LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER 7. The Speaker took the chair at half-past three o'clock. TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. The COLONIAL SECRETARY, under the command of His Excellency the Governor, laid upon then able of the House a highly important despatch, which he had received from the Right Honourable the Secretary of State, relative to the transportation system. The despatch contained information of the highest importance to the colony, and although it had been marked " private and confidential," His Excellency had thought fit to lay it before the Council, with a view to its publicity, in order that the opinions of the colonists on the subject might be elicited. (Hear, hear, hear.) He should now move that the despatch be printed. Carried. BELL AND HAMILTON. Mr. MACARTHUR presented a petition from John Hamilton, of Parramatta, setting forth that he had been much injured by the delay which had taken place in certain criminal proceedings which had been instituted against him by a convict who had been nineteen times convicted. Before these proceedings were commenced his credit stood high, and his trade was flourishing ; but he had since been obliged to turn insolvent, and although his creditors had readily acceded to his receiving his certificate, that during the pend ing of such proceedings his reputation and interests suffered; that these proceedings had been protracted over a space of two years, and had exposed him to an expense of £900. He prayed the House that it would grant him compensation for the injuries he had suffered, and that it would take measures to prevent such delays in the administration of justice taking place in future. He (Mr. Macarthur) should not stop to inquire whether the allegations of the petition were true or not, but he did think that a very serious question was involved in the matter respecting the administration of justice. He should move that the petition be read. Mr. WINDEYER seconded the motion. The petition having been read, its reception was objected to on a point of order, that it prayed for a specific sum of money, and it was consequently withdrawn by Mr. Macarthur. LEGAL PROFESSION. The COLONIAL SECRETARY, in the absence of the Attorney-General, moved that the petition from the Port Phillip Bay, presented by him yesterday, be referred to the Select Committee on the Division of the Legal Profession Bill. The motion was agreed to, THE SQUATTERS. Captain O'CONNELL gave notice that he would move, on Friday, the 16th October, " That an address be presented to His Excellency the Governor, praying that His Excellency will be pleased to urge upon the attention of Her Majesty's Government, through Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, the anomalous position with regard to political rights held by licensed occupiers of crown lands in this colony, who, subjects of Great Britain by birth, colonists of a portion of her dominions to which the right of Government by representation has been formally conceded, and holders of property to the extent of fully one-half of the productive capital of the colony they inhabit, are yet taxed without representation, and legislated for in this Council without having any voice in the election of its members and that His Excellency will be further pleased to recommend to Her Majesty's Government the adop- tion of such measures as may be deemed best calculated to obviate this unconstitutional grievance, and to convert what are now licenses to occupy crown lands from year to year, into such other and more permanent tenure, as will, under proper restrictions for the public benefit, and without danger from undue influence on that constitutional right, carry with it a legal claim to the benefit of the elective franchise. ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS BILL. On the motion of the COLONIAL SECRETARY, the second reading of the Estates of Deceased Persons Better Management Bill was postponed till this day, VACCINE INSTITUTION. The COLONIAL SECRETARY moved that his Excellency's Message the subject of a Vaccine Institution be read. The Message was read by the Clerk. The COLONIAL SECRETARY said, the circumstances which induced the proposal of his Excellency were so clearly stated in the message and its enclosures, that it would not be needful for him to enter into any lengthened observations on the subject. It was well known that in a colony with which this was in constant commercial intercourse small pox had been raging to a fatal extent. In this colony they had fortunately hitherto been free from the ravages of this frightful scourge, but it was incumbent on them to take every precaution in their power against its introduction. In order to do this, it was necessary that a constant supply of vaccine lymph should be kept in the colony, and be made available for use whenever it was required. This it was found very difficult to do without the establishment of a vaccine institution. It was a subject which had frequently occupied his thoughts ; but hitherto there had been difficulties in the way of such an establishment. He should therefore move, when the miscellaneous estimates were called on that this item be taken into consideration. The COLONIAL TREASURER seconded the motion. Mr. WINDEYER: There was a large part of the question connected with this subject of which he was personally utterly unable to judge, and he had therefore made enquiries into the matter of medical friends of his, and he found what he suspected to be the fact was entirely confirmed. That there was in fact, not to use the short and strong word in which the proposal had been described, no difficulty whatever in keeping up the supply of vaccine lymph. The House too should recollect that in voting this sum, and thus raising a new official institution, they would fasten on themselves this expense for ever, and make it also the nucleus for other establishments of the same description in the different towns of the colony. He agreed with the Colonial Secretary that the subject was a very serious one, and that the danger ought to be seriously guarded against ; but it might be guarded against equally well in a different, and less expensive way. He hoped therefore the Colonial Secretary would postpone this matter till next Session, when a Committee might be appointed to enquire into the necessity there was for all the appointments contained in the present estimate. It was true that there was a time when there was a difficulty in procuring a supply of vaccine lymph, but, like other of their difficulties, that had passed away. He had applied to his own medical man, who immediately took out two square bits of glass on which the lymph was, and he, assured him that there was no difficulty in maintaining the supply that it was just as easy to keep up a regular supply of children with the small pox, as it was to keep up the supply of children without the small pox (great laughter). He did not see that there was anything very pressing in the matter, and hoped that the Colonial Secretary would consent to postpone it. Mr. BLAND agreed in the main with the honorable member for Durham, that this measure had better be referred to a Committee, where inquiry might be made into it. The COLONIAL SECRETARY . TK" nnW objection he could have to the postponement of the measure was, that in the mean time the small pox might make its appearance, with the most disastrous effect on human life. It was found advisable that vaccine institutions should be established in England, and he thought that in a city like Sydney, containing upwards of 38,000 inhabitants, such an institution ought to exist. It was not so much for the benefit of the richer classes, who, he admitted, might generally obtain a supply of the lymph, as for the poorer ones, that this measure was intended, and when it was remembered how fearfully this disease had raged in the Mauritius and Manila, where many thousands of children had been destroyed by it, and what constant commercial intercourse prevailed between both these colonies and New South Wales, he did not think they would he justified in procrastinating any precautions it was in the power of the Council to take. He must contend that there was not always so great a facility in obtaining lymph as was supposed by the honorable and learned member for Durham, for he had at times been unable to procure it for himself. It was true, perhaps, that the expense need not be so great as that proposed in the estimate, but looking at it in an economical point of view only, he thought it would be better to admit this trifling charge than to run any risk of seeing the emigrants whom they had introduced at the cost of a million of money, dying off by thousands. Thus, even if motives of humanity were left out of the question, he did not think this matter should be deferred The establishment of this Institution was not intended to benefit Sydney only, but to procure and maintain a supply of lymph, which could be distributed throughout the colony. He could not looking at the great general good such a measure was calculated to produce, consent to its postponement till next session, whatever alteration the Council might think fit to make in the estimate. Mr. BLAND explained, he was not opposed to the object proposed, but that he thought the machinery was not only cumbersome but inadequate. The question was then put, and the House divided, when there appeared Ayes. Noes.

Government House, Sydney 7th October, 1846. A - The Message was ordered to be printed, and taken into consideration to-morrow. CIRCULAR QUAY. The COLONIAL SECRETARY moved that his Excellency's message, enclosing a Bill for carrying on the construction of a Circular Quay, be read. The message having been read The COLONIAL SECRETARY said it was not his intention to press the measure during the session ; but it had been sent down to re- fresh the memory of honorable members, and to enable them to come prepared to give a decision on the subject during the next session; he should therefore leave the Bill on the table. MELBOURNE COURT OF REQUESTS. The COLONIAL SECRETARY moved that the consideration of his Excellency's message, with the Melbourne Court of Requests Bill be postponed till this day, Agreed to. CUSTOMS ACT. The COLLECTOR of CUSTOMS moved that the further consideration in committee of the Customs Act Amendment Bill be postponed till this day Agreed to. WHARFAGE RATES BILL.

MELBOURNE INCORPORATION BILL. The COLONIAL SECRETARY moved that section 70 of the Melbourne Corporation Act Suspension Bill be read a third time Curred.

On the order of the day being moved for the further consideration in Committee of the estimates for 1817. Mr. WENTWORTH, in pursuance of notice, moved " That this Council do agree to and adopt the following Address to His Excellency the Governor: ' We, the members of the Legislative Coun- i el of New South Wales, in Council assem- | bled perceiving that your Excellency has placed on the Estimates of Expenditure, several departments for which provision is made by Schedule A, to the Act of Parliament 5 and 6 Victoria, cap. 76, annexed desire most respectfully to intimate to your Excellency that, being thus called on to vote a Supplement to the services in the said schedule enumerated, we claim the right, as heretofore, to fix the amount to be appropriated to every detail of such services, except such as are specifically provided for in such schedule. At the same time, we respectfully beg to assure your Excellency, that we have no intention, in asserting this right to propose alterations in any of the salaries in the said schedule to which the faith of Her Majesty's Government has already been pledged.' It would be in the recollection of the House that in its first session, when it was the opinion of the Governor that it was necessary that a supplement should be voted to schedule A that he had invited them to examine the different items contained in that schedule. He had then stated to them in his message to the Council with the estimates, that it was fit and proper they should exercise a right to examine such schedule, before they voted any supple- ment to it. In compliance with his Excellency's wish, the Council did proceed con amore to the work of examination (laughter). And considering the finances of the colony to be in a very depressed state, they did bridge many items in. that schedule, but in obeying his Excellency's desire, they had gone . further than he imagined they would go, or at least than he thought it was desirable they should go. He consequently received the invitation he had given to the Council, and the Council then refused to vote the supplement asked for. It was not necessary for him to go into all the details which had since occurred with respect to this matter. It was enough to say, that when- ever the Council had been asked to vote any supplement to the schedule, it had unhesitatingly refused, steadily maintaining the principle it had laid down of having a right to examine all the items of any schedule if they were called on to make any additions to it. It would appear that a supplement to this schedule was asked for 1847, and it was on that ground that he moved the nrpHcnf Addtpus to his Excellency. The resolutions of the Council on the subject were framed in reason and justice, and they could not depart from them. The only way that House could vote the supplement asked for, was, by having the schedule submitted to its consideration. The address asserted the right expressed in the former resolutions of the House, namely the right to fix the amount to be appropriated to every detail of such services, except such as are specially provided for in such schedule. There were certain salaries in the schedule fixed by the Act, and these of course they could not interfere with, but the other items of the schedule the Council had a right to control-a right fully conceded in the first financial message of his late Excellency. The claim of the Council indeed in this particular was evidently grounded in common sense, for it was absurd to ask them to vote in addition without giving them the power to judge whether such assistance was necessary or not. They could not, therefore, vote the supplement without the power was conceded to them of fixing the salaries in the schedule. But the aspect of the times was changed. They were not now oppressed with the same financial difficulties which formerly oppressed them. The Government too was changed, and happy was he to say, that the change was not only a change of men, but a change of measures, and now for the first time had that Council been met with a spirit of cordiality, which it was fit should exist between the Executive and the Legislature. On these grounds he deemed it right that the Council should, whilst maintaining its principle as far as possible, relieve the Government from embarrassment, and it was for this reason that the latter part of the address assuring his Excellency that the Council had no intention to propose alterations in the salaries in the schedule to which the faith of Her Majesty's Government was pledged, was intended. He believed these salaries were not very numerous. The late Government seemed most afraid of the salaries of the Master and the Prothonotary, and doubtless if the schedule had been left to the Council, these gentlemen would have been cut down a hundred or two. In doing so, he confessed he thought the Council would have done no more than its duty, as these salaries were fixed by the Secretary of State after the Constitutional Act was promulgated, and when he must Imre ttimm ribs., ...... ennui in ilium.uuve Known that the Council had a right to fix these salaries itself. But, as he had before said, the financial state of affairs was reformed, and the Government was reformed, and he doubted not the schedule would be now submitted to them in effect as fully as it was in words by the late Governor. He for one, therefore, was willing to refrain from dealing with these pledged salaries, which, right or wrong, had been promised, and after the alteration in the measures of the Government, and the spirit of frankness with which they had been met, he was not disposed to interfere with them. He was not without hope that the course to which he now invited them would not be without its effect on the Local Government, and the Home Government too, and that no future appointments would be made without the sanction of the Council. By adopt- ing this course too, one great difficulty in the way of a friendly co-operation between the Executive and the Legislative Council would be got rid of ; said he trusted that His ! Excellency would not think that there was any intention in this course to embarrass his go- ' vernment. His intention in moving the address was far different. It was to smooth out of his path some of the obstacles which had been left by his predecessor j and it was in all good faith that he, and he believed these who would support him, now moved this address. (Hear, hear.)- - Mr. COWPER seconded the motion. The COLONIAL SECRETARY in rising to make a few observations, had not the slightest intention of opposing the motion on the part of the Government. The great reason which he had ever opposed to the reduction in the salaries of the schedule was, that the faith of the Government was pledged to maintain some of them, and that pledge he thought should be kept inviolable. The reduction of these salaries was strictly guarded in this address, and with this provision, he admitted that as a supplement was asked, the schedule should be submitted to the Council. He should, therefore, he was happy to say, be able tome.etthe hon. and learned member for Sydney in the spirit of kindness and cordiality which his own speech breathed; and he should always rejoice to forward the good understand- ing which it was so desirable should prevail between the Government and the Legislature. He believed that the address would be received in perfect sincerity and for his own part, as he felt sure his honorable friend had no intention to embarrass the Government, he should cordially support the motion. Mr. WINDEYER:, Should also be happy to support the address, as, if the mainobject of the Colonial Secretary, which he admitted had always been to maintain the faith of the Home Government to certain persons, were secured by it, so was the principle which had been laid down by the Council. He had no idea that there would be any intention to circumvent the Council, and should rejoice to join in the cordial feeling which seemed to prevail. He might not go all the way with his honorable and learned friend as to the improved state of the revenue, but he did feel that something was due to his Excellency, as all the overtures and acts of conciliation had as yet proceeded from him, and he deemed it right for the Council on the present occasion to offer a mark of confidence and gratitude. The motion was then put and passed, and the Address was ordered to be presented by the Speaker, the Colonial Secretary, and the Colonial Treasurer. On the motion of the Colonial Treasurer the Council went into Committee on the Estimates of Expenditure for 1847. SYDNEY GAOL.

He did not approve of the Government undertaking the business of wharfingers. The COLONIAL SECRETARY The vote was required partly to complete works already begun. It was not intended to extend it until the Bill, which had been this day postponed, had been under the consideration of the House. If this work were to go on, there were funds arising from the sale of land which had been redeemed from the sea to meet it, as the proceeds of the sale of such allotments were not paid into the Crown revenue. After a short conversation the items were carried. PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The COLONIAL TREASURER moved the sum of £2000, for the expense of building a Court-house at Goulburn. The COLONIAL SECRETARY explained that this sum would complete the building and was very anxious that Circuit Courts should be extended to Goulburn, and hoped that arrangements for such a purpose might be carried into effect by February next. Carried The COLONIAL TREASURER moved the sum of £2000, for the expense of building a Court-house at Bathurst. Carried. The COLONIAL TREASURER moved the sum of £2500, towards completing the new Gaol at Maitland Carried. The COLONIAL SECRETARY moved the sum of £600, for completing the new Gaol at Darlinghurst. Mr. WINDEYER asked if this sum was to go to the treadmill, which they had voted a large sum of money for two years ago, and which was not yet completed. The COLONIAL SECRETARY stated, that a difficulty had arisen as to the establishment of the treadmill at Darlinghurst, from a claim for £600 for the treadmill, which had been made by the military chest. The item was postponed for the present. The COLONIAL TREASURER moved the sum of £820 for the building of a gaol at Moreton Bay. Mr. LOWE asked if the gaol would not be very small. The COLONIAL SECRETARY explained : There were large buildings at Moreton Bay, built whilst it was a penal settlement, and these had been handed over to the colony and it was to repair and put these in order that the money was required. Mr. LOWE would call the attention of the Government to the state of this district, where crime at present was almost unpunished, from the expense of coming 900 miles to prosecute. He would suggest whether a Court of Quarter Sessions might not be erected in the district. The COLONIAL SECRETARY agreed with the honorable and learned member that it was necessary that something should be done, and promised that it should have his attention. The item was then passed. The following items were passed without observation : For enclosing the Yard and providing Privies for the accommodation of the public, at the Criminal Court House, Sydney. £200 0 0 For providing Iron Doors to twelve cells; providing Bars to the windows at the circular ends of the wings, and Iron Gratings for securing the Areas round the Gaoler's House at Parramatta Gaol. MO 0 0 The COLONIAL TREASURER moved the sum of £2500 For enclosing the proposed Cemeteries with a stone wall, eight feet high, and subdividing the same into six compart- ments, by stone walls, six feet high £2,500 0 0 Mr. WINDEYER must protest against the motion. The eight feet wall round the cemetery was all very well, but the stone walls "and the six compartments was too absurd. The idea of dead men being cooped up in stone walls, in order to prevent their religions clash has "? J'mignt be very well that a division should be made for the different denominations, but surely a broad walk would be sufficient to mark such division, without a six feet stone wall, which, after all, would not prevent their ghosts getting at each other, if they were so inclined. The COLONIAL SECRETARY explained, that the plan had been adopted in intended compliance with the report of the Committee of last session. T>£ïV^ICII0LS0;Nr' Mr- LAMB, and Mr. ROBINSON, members of the Committee, had neither of them ever heard a word about stone walls and compartments on Committee. It was proposed that the ground should be allotted to the different denominations, and that each division should have a separate entrance and be marked off by a broad walk. Mr. LOWE was also a member of the Committee, and took Warne to himself that he had not looked into the report more narrowly before it was adopted. He could see no use in sorting out the dead like so many units of a pack of cards; far better would it be to spend the money required for these stone walls on a general system of education for the living, than in providing a denominational system of interment for the dead. The COLONIAL SECRETARY was very good that he was mistaken as to the intentions of the Committee, and would alter the vote by substituting the words .' and improving the same after the word I subdividing" in the original motion, Carried.
