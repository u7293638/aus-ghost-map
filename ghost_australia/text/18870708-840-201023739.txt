Three Mighty Ms. In the lecture-room of the Young Men's Christian Association last night, Rev. W. Osborne Lilley delivered his lecture entitled 'Money, Muscle, and Mind.' Mr. Edgar W. 'Walker occupied tho chair, and there was a good attendance. The chairman having briefly introduced the lecturer, Mr. Lilloy at once entered into his subject. Dealing with money, ho showed tho advantages of a system of coinage, the power and responsibility of men of wealth,. inasmuch aa like most of God's best gifts it might be the means of tho highest enjoyment and good to others, or the pass to all that is vicious and degrading to a human being. Speaking of muscle, ho said men could not expect to give God tho fullest service who neglected the Temple of the Holy v ' Ghost, and ho urged every young man to make good use of tho bath, \- ai.d the means of exercise within his reach. Mind, he said, was the masterpiece of God's creation. No one could measure the capabilities of the mind. It had made lightning a servant, it had measured and weighed the heavens, it had made the sun do the work of an artist, and analysed tho materials of the earth. In con cluBion, he urged every young man to find out his' talents and set to work and improve them, but not to waBto his time on things for which he had neither taste nor ability. Above all, he should cultivate his moral nature. They might not all be great, but all may be good, and to follow ChriBt was tho highest privilege of man, and to do Hib will was to gain eternal life. A hearty votes of thanks was accorded to Mr. Lilloy and the chairman by acclamation. It was announced that the subject for next Thursday's lecture, by Rev. W. 'Whale, would bo ' The Law of Development as Applied to tho State.' ^^^^^^^^^^
