CRICKET. TO THE EDITOR. —Yours, &c.;, E. CAMERON, Hon. See.H.G.C.C.C. SIR, —Kindly allow me to correct a state me it that appeared in the sporting colum [?] of your paper relative to the match played between the High school and the Holy Ghost College. In the notice it was said that the third eleven of the High school played the second eleven of our college, whereas it should have been our third eleven, ns both the clubs were of the third order; at least I can vouch for ours.
