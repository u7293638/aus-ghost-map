INSANE CONDUCT "SPRING HEEL JACK" AGAIN. Some five or six years ago the resldents of Brunswick and Coburg, more Specially the children and females, were scared by the conduct of an evidently idiotic young fellow who attempted to play the part of Ghost, " Spring Heel Jack" fashion. Tho idiot has again appealed, and secretes himself in various portions of Moreland and the north end of Brunswick, and of people are passing by suddenly springs up, garbed in white raiment and dashes past them at such a furious speed that the softer sex be- come fearfully alarmed, aud in some cases faintiug has been the result. On Friday night the woutd-be ghost succeeded in frightening a night watchman. Several young men of the district have been out late at night armed with weapons that will necessitate tho midnight prowler laying up for a considerable time with a sore body if they drop across him, and he will do well to relinquish his foolish conduct.
