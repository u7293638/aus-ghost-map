THE SONG OF THE WORLD At the foot of the Caucasus tipped with snows, Through the Cassacr's valley the Terek flows And the Cossack on guard at the waters edge, As he watches each shadow of bush and sedge Sings to himself a sweet love son, ' Donchinka, Donchinka, The night is long, But my eye is bright, and my riffle light, And I wait for the day that follows night And the earth with the sea in harmony blends ; Where life is in living, -and love never old, And sings with the touch of a sigh, 'Anima mia, Bright is thine eye. I long for the time when the church bells' chime shall echo for thee like thy lover's rhyme.' The wild billows break o'er the rock-sheltered coast, The spray in the moonlight is faint as a ghost, And the Brittany fisher before his shrine bows In prayer for his love, and a candle he vows, And whispers in solemn refrain, ' Bien aimre I come again.' The gulls sweeping by hear the lover's cry Aud the winds call buck the words with a sigh. Through the Roman Valley, by Caneasus snows, by the Icelandic shores the melody flows ; it is ever the same that the lover sings ; He is lost to the World and to mundane things. While wonderful visions are wrought, ' Thou art my thought' Thedays come and go, Time's sand slowly flow but the Love that is planted forever will grow. \- Flavel Scott Mines.
