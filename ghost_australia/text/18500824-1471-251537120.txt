-0ft. LANG AND THE SYDNEY ELECTORS v. WENT f ! WORTH, DONALDSON & CO. A MoVivix dozen of honourable men in Macquarie-street bars said it,— DiC Lang and the Electors of Sidney are condemned 1 How can any man of the 950 hold np bis bead, af;tr the whole have been denounced by Mr. Donaldson ? How1 will their member uncover his face 19 the son, now the frowning Mr. Darvall has lowered upon his fortunes ? Shall it be possible for the citizens to retain the character of other than a violent and unquiet people, when the oalm and moderate' Mr. Wentworth has cast on them his stigma?" Yet is the City of Sydney a City suil, and yet is Dr. Lang the most powerful man in Australia ! The Council has made a mistake in its brutal persecution of Dr. Lang,— -"one dangerous to the success of its wicked desigus, and one , most instructive to the people of this country. A blackleg and a gambler may fume about morality— a splutteriogly ignorant and awkwardly vain incarnation of" sapient dandyism may .conjure up bis bloated ghosts of socialism and disorder— a booby of a boy \- elephant may expound his own. enigmas of sagacity, but, all will tend to the same desirable end. Theseexhibitions will open the eyes of the people. The weaknesses, as well as the vices, of our legislators will be made known. Coqfempt will become an anxilary to hate in the minds of the people. We, therefore, rather rejoice than otherwise at the sight of these unblushing mental orgies of \- the. Macquarie- street mob." Tueso things we are confident are preparing the way most happily for the coming elections The truth of tc- will be seen, when Mr. Wentworth is beaten out of Sydney, Mr. Darvall is lent whining back from Bathurst, and the pudding hero himself is left disconsolate on the borders of Durham. As to Master Aubrey, he is regularly booj&ed; for Constantinople We hail live to s?o every small boy in/Sydney orying after him — in „ the name of the prophet — figs. ' ,
