JldiL'iiit -Hisotftris I A DREAM OF DEATIT. By Is a CnAto. Nothing griovnil me, nothing pained me. Soft I sank awny, Till the arm that had sustained mc, Held but helpless -clay. By m.v head a sigh was uttered, "A nil n ghost of sound Benched mc as my spirit fluttered O'er the nwful bound. Then there censed n swift strong motion. Ages might have rolled, Countless as the drops of ocean, As the grains of mould ; I Or a moment scnrec have flitted, I Of the earthly day, Since my prison house I quitted 1 By the unknown way, 'Clothed I was with shape ethereal, I In my mortal frame, Moulded but of no material Known by mortal name. Tidings still must rest unspoken, Of that wonder land ; Bytnn earthly sign or token M iglit men understand, Could lie told its bidden glories, Or the raptures flow Of tlic endless hmniiti stories Closing here in woe. But upnnlts shore. I only Lingered, so it seemed, And my soul grew sad and lonely. For no moro 1 dreamed.
