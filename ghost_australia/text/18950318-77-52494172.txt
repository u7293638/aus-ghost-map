TUE KEW ROMAN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL. LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE. \csterday Baw an important, though formal, step taken towards the completion of the long cherished ambition of the Roman Cathohes of Ccntial Queensland, und par ticularlv of Rockhampton - that thej should build a caihcdial which foi ccn tunes woul 1 be a rall J ing point of 'heir ehuicli, and au ornament to Rod hampton The cathedral walls hale been Btcadil) using for mam montliB past, but yesterday afternoon the foundation, or as it might more tilly bi called the memorial stone, was foi .nally laid bj Bishop Camm the presence of a great gatheiing estimated ut from two thousand to three thousand people The onginal arrangement was that Aich bishop Dunne should pcrfoilu tins ceiemonj, but owing to the accident to the steamet Merkara, Di Dnnncwaspreicntedfronbeing present Tu hale teen Alehbishop Dunne officiating would no doubt haie been a great gratification to the Roman Catholics of Rock hampton, us nell as to many outside that communion But it must be admitted it was m man) wujs very fitting that Bushop Cam should p"iforni lins ceiemonj Next perhaps to the stanwell Orphanage, the building of this cathedral has engaged Bishop Cam s warmest sympathies since he cime to Rock hampton He has w orked for it w ith unceasing thought and energy, and it must have afforded him no small pride and happiness to sec it so far advanced, and with his own hands to lay this chief stouc in a building that he hopes for generations vi ill he a centre for the work to which he is so deiotcd Bishop Cams sense of triumph at the great distance which bas been travelled to»aids this goal, must also be shared in large measure by the committee which has worked with linn no courageous!), holding on to their purpose through many years, often no doubt with little apparent prospect of seeing it accomplished in their du) In a sense neither Bishop Cam nor the committee eau reasonably hope to see the full cathedral completed The design is a great one, and the portion of this is non under contract forms not one half of the architect s full plan But while that is true, it is equally tiuc that the part now being built w ill of itself be the largest ecclesiastical structuie in the colon), and it is already so far advnuccd that Bishop Cam w as already able to announce yesterday that he hoped to see it opened for w orship in about eighteen months fro n non The motfincnt foi the erection of this cathedral had its origin in tne time of the pastorate in Rockhampton of Dean Murlay . man who was revered b) all classes of the community, und whose departure from the town for Sydney (where he now resides) was \ery generally regretted It is nearly fifteen years since the scheme was 6rst entered on, ana a great impetus was gil cn to it by u bazaar, which netted the very large sum of £1200 Wi.h that amount in hand, collecting was taken up« itb some vigour, and several very handsome subscriptions were paid and promised But after a year or so the canvass was suspended, to be rented again very energetically a year or two after the arrival here of Bishop Cant, and it has been carried on continuously ever since, and is still being prosecuted The foundations of the present building- which, as already stated, is only part of the full structure-were laid about two years ago at a cost of about £1 KM, Mr F H Harns being the contractor On the 3rd of June last the tender of Mr D Kellehcr was accepted for the erection of the superstructure, the pnce being £14,700 Of that amount £3500 has been paid, and the church committee has in hand about £2200 So yesterday morning there was still £9000 required to pay for the woik now in progress, ana then there will be the windows, the furniture, and an organ to provide for That will mean an additional £2000 at least Already steps are being taken to secure portion of the funds required The ladies of the church are arranging for a bazaar, to take place some months hence, and there is no doubt it will result in a very considerable profit. Meanwhile canvassing will be con tinued, and though, perhaps, some of the money will have to be raised by mortgage, that will not be altogether noiel in church building Mr Kelleher started on his woik on the 11th of June last, and has made splendid pro gress He has had about fifty men constantly employed, and is hopeful that, with favour able conditions, he will be able to hand over the building in about eighteen months' time It is almost impossible to gue an idea of the amount of work done up till the present, but it may be stated that the front wall has already reached a height of about 20 ft and the side walls a height of from 20 ft to 24 ft Mr Kelleher has spared no expense to get the cathedral completed as rapidly as pos sible He has had three cranes erected- two on platforms 22ft. aboie the level of the ground, the other ou a platform 52 ft high The two lower cranes have jibs 64 ft long, and can deliver stone to a height of 86ft, the higher one bus a jib 82ft. long, aud ..an deiner a stone at a height of 134 ft These will suffice to complete the contract, but when the topmost block is raised there will be only about 3 ft to upare The cathedral is being erected on a large Mock of land situated at the corner of William and West streets which was ac quired many years ago-in fact, in the early dava of Rockhampton-hy Dean Murley The architects are Messrs F D G Stanley and Sons, Brisbane Mr Kellchers contract comprises the two western towers, the main vestibule, and the nave and aisles of the future full cathedral The cathedral is being built entirely of Stan well sandstone, and, when completed, will beal comparison with any «imitar ecclesiastical structure in the Aus traban colonies Entering by the main w es tern door, and passing through the vestibule the nave will be directly reached It will have a floor space of 131 ft by 39 ft, and will he flanked on either side by the nave columns end arches, eight in number Taking in the width of the aisles the total floor space w ill be 131ft by 78 ft Hie side walls of the nave will rise to a height of 40 ft from the floor, and the whole will be coierod by a ?vaulted ceiling rising to a height of 51 ft On each side of the na\ e the aisles w ill liai e a width of 16 ft, and be similarly vaulted over to a height of 21 ft The entire floor will be laid with black and white marble 'iles set on cement concrete The lighting of the inulding v-ill be provided for by sixteen niele windows, each of two lights and alternate in dcBign, also by the large w est window, which will have a height of 30ft by a width of 16 ft., and be divided into five lights with richly traccned head Ingress to and egress from the building will be provided from Hie doorways - three in the western gable and one each from the north and ?south aisles The seating capacity of the building will be for 15011 persons -larger than any church at present in the colony-and this madefii e doors indispensable The general design of the building will be throughout in the early English and transi- tional periods of Gothic, among which many of the most beautiful specimens of ancient Gothic may be found. The western towers ani spires will rise to a height of 115 ft., and °oc specially constructed with regard to strength to meet the weight of future peals of bells. The structure will be of the most solid description, and contrary to all or- dinary church buildings, the walls will be constructed of through stones only-that is, «ach stone as laid in the wall will be one full width thereof. There will consequently be no centro joints, or packing, but u solid mass of masonry, the value of which will be apparent to all acquainted with the subject. PONTIFICAL HIGH MASS. When it is recalled that the great majority of the Roman Catholics of Rockhampton, as indeed of all Australian towns, are either of Irish birth or extraction, and the intensely national feeling of the Irish people is taken into accouut, no surprise: will be expressed at St Patrick's Day having been chosen for the laying of this foundation stone The date, moreover, falling on Sunda), made the wax clearer for the congregation of St Joseph's to attend the stately and solemn service which it had been resolved to hold in the church There were two earl) masses yesterday, the fust at seven o clock and I I the second at nine, the latter being attended b) the Hibernian Societ) The members assembled at their hull and inarched m procession to the church, headed by the Lakes Creek band The chief Benlee was at eleven o'clock, when pontifical high mass was celebrated by Bishop Cum The music foi this mass was taken chiefly from Mozart'«. 12th Mass, and it had been under iclicarsal for some time past by a laigcly reinforced choir, assisted bj an orchestra drawn chiefly from the members of tlu Orpheus Club The Rev Father Belton, C L R , w ho is not oulj an aceom phshed musician but also a mast com petcnt ebon maslen, hud undertaken I he entire charge of the musical patt of the ser lice, and was also the preacher of the daj his woik being thus unusually heavy md responsible It would be out of pluec here to speak in au) critical v\av of father Belton s sermon-and unnecessary us well, foi it is rcpoitcd in full behm-but it is permissible to say that his work us c1 oirmuster was rcmarkabl) successful The music all through, both local and instrumental, was performed in a manner that won warm expressions of admiration fiom all competent to speak on such a richly classical vi ork as this If the choir w as assisted by singers and plaversfrom outside its own rauks, the con gregation composed many prominent musical people who do not belang to the church, but who had been drawn theie b) the intimation of the work that was to be Bung From a musical pointof view the congregation was thus unusually fitted to judge and to enjoy the work of the choir The church was packed to the door, indeed there was a icry fair congregation present bj a quarter past ten The day throughout was perfect, and fortunately the morning was fairly cool so the heat in the body of the church was not par ttcularly opprcssn e, notw lthstanding the great congregation, though in the organ loft it nab severe The mass was to start at eleven, but there was a little delay At ten minutes past eleven o clock the choir sang the hymn to M Patrick Ten minutes later Bishop Cam, who was assisted by the Rev Father Plormel as deacon, and Fathei Lorretucci as sub deacon entered the sanctuary, and the choir at once started the Kytie, which vi as very finely rendered Mozarts great Gloria foi lowed, the time and expression being especiallj good The Qui ToUis was sung as a duet by Mrs D S Macdonald and Mr Sankey, both singers givinga fine interpretation of the music The aerinou followed Then came the Credo, which was taken from Haydn's Im penal Mass, the ht Inca)notus est being sung as a solo by Mrs Tames Kell), who is aln aj s heard with great pleasure in Rockhampton The solo was Bung w ith fine expression The offertory piece was also sung by Mrs kell), who rendered Lambillotte's Stwcipe Domine The Sanctus was taken from Mozart's Mass as was also the Benedictus, in w hich the soprano solo was taken by Miss Florence Schmidt, the tenor by Mr B V Kavanagh, and the bass bv Mr M'Cormack This was one of the gems of the service The Agnus Dn was beautifully sung by Mrs Macdonald The service occupied exactly two hours, closing at twenty minutes past one o'clock The Rev Father Belton preached from the text "Aye, lather blessed are they which 1 ear the Word of God, and keep it ' He said My Lord Bishop, rev erend fathers, and dearly beloved brothren in Jesus Christ,-These words of our blessed Lord, I think, arc most appropriate to this solemnity which wc are now celebrating As J ou know, we are gathered here to day for two purposes-to give honour and glory to Almighty God This is the first principle of hoi) religion We are here to day also to honour the memory of one of God's greatest saints-St Patrick W e are here to da) also to cele brate the laying of the foundation stone of the new Roman Catholic cathedral in Rockhampton These words of our Saviour, as he was being praised for the miracles he had been working, are appropriate to this occasion, because it is principally in churches that we hear the « ord of God \\\ e come to church to adore God, to make our offering to God W e come to church to hear the W ord of God expounded by his ministers I think it would not be amiss for us to ponder for a few moments upon what we mean by the Church The church is the house of the people and the house of God, and it is well for us, before going any further, to understand what vre mean by people We know that years ago when the pagans had the rule of the world that there were two decidedly distinct societies amongst men, the free man and the slav e The free man-the master-took all on himself The slave had no libertj, no mind of his own, no freedom of thought no freedom of action , but was simply, in lery truth, a slave Ei en to this day we find in certain parts of the world the same thing existing Christiauit) did away with all thiB Jesus Christ caine into the world to show us that we were all equal -that there was no slave in the wot Id This is proved to us First of all we see it by the fact of our origin \\\ e are all af the same origin God has created us out of the dust of the earth As he told Adam and Eve, when he banished them from the Garden, "Dust thou art and unto dust ehalt thou return ," dust vic all are Our origin has been that, and in that we are all equal There shall be no changing \ ea, w c see the unn ersal equality of man in our Redemption Jesus Christ did not die for any particular nation or for any particular individual He died for all men, and in the precious blood of Jesus we have the abolition of slavery and the equality of all men Hence, by the word people it ia understood that we ineau the whole world-no mdmdual class, but the whole world This, I may say, is the definí tion of the people and of the house of the people-all working together for our own salvation, all working together for the glor) and honour of God, all helping one another, all having the views and desires of Jesus Christ tending to the salvation of the world And here we see what a wonderful organisa lion a church is, what a wonderful power the Church is JiiBt as m the human bod) the hands have their part and their work to do, the head has its work to do, and so the different parts of the body-so it l8 w ith the people We have all our woi k in the world to do God has placed us in the woild to do some special work, and as long as that goes on, so long will everything go on smoothly As in the body, if the hand re fuses to work and the head refuses to w 01 k, there is disunion, so it is in the world amongst the people As long as wc arc united and ate each satisfied in carrying out our duties in the path that God has placed us, so will everything move smoothly. As I said before, we are all equal. Jesus Christ has brought us into the world and gives each one of us the opportunity to raise ourselves up, whatever maybe out position in the world. We may be at the present moment poor, vi e may to morrow -or w ¡thin a short time-be the hope of our country At the present moment wc may be downtrodden, nud in a short »¡mc wc may be able to raise ourselves up. When we contemplate the Church, the wonderful power of the Church, it is fit that wc glorify God. lu the Church we see the rich and poor mingling togcthci. The Church brings in the rich and the poor. Before the altar they sit side by side. Those who outBide are at enmity and strife with one another, in the church meet together. The good and sinless soul and the poor, miserable sinner steeped decpin sin, also come and kneel at the foot of the altar. The Church opcnB her arms to all, and all come in. Everything is left-eicry jealousy, every Bin is left out- side. As vic entei upon the threshold of the church ull_these things are forgotten, and as St. Paul said, in the multitude assembling together there was but one heart and one soul In adoring their God But it is not oulj the temple-the structure of tbo church There is something far more than this Up till the present I have been speaking simpl) of the inatcual walls pf the church but the chut oh is a tribunal -a lusting seat of teaching Here m passing, I may mention that-not withstanding that there alp many m the world who scoff at religion and that there arc many who do not belief« in religion at all even these if they be mon of intellect if thev be men desirous of the welfare of then country, when the) took upon the ooiect that the Church has in v lew, and the founait ion of li at Church, in their hearts the) must seer that it is a source of social intellectual and moral cultivation even though exterior') und out wardl) the) ma) scoff at it lirst ofull wc know that there was Une vino came amongst us eighteen hundred )car» and more ago Jesus Christ, lhat He carne into the world to sale mankind He carne into thcwoild not to destro) the Law, but to fulfil it Though time after time he was upbraided and called u lawbreaker, what do we find ** \\*ie hale our dear Lord going throughout Bethlehem and luden doing good, and with such success that the people erj out, "Sucha man has never appeared amongst us before , God Himself has come in oui midst So tins Gospel of His this Gospel that our blessed Lord preached while He was ni the woild-taken down b) His apostles and His disciples, embodies perfection If wc carr) it nut, then indeed, shall we be perfect There the nell man is told that all that he has received is re ceued from God, There the poor man is taught that he has a position in the world, and wc have the relationship of the two de fined by God-the uch to support the poor, and the poor not to rob the rich lhere in this same Gospel again we sec woman raised up - womau who hereto fore had been a slave, and therefore looked down upon In the eje of the Christian law woman is laiscd up to become the companion of man, and to do her wntk in the world with man, side bj side with lum, and to raise up children and educate children according to the law of Christ and according to the law of the land-to be an honour to their state and to their church When we sec what is taught in the Church, w hen w e see \\\ iio founded the Church, then indeed w e must glorify Cod, and be thankful to Him, and cr) out with the ro)al prophet, " \A hat can I return to the Lord for all He has done for me''' Beside the church being the house of the people and the house of God, it is also the gate of Heaven Here wc all meet together to tender worship to oui great Creator and our Maker Here wc come together to pra)-"Thy house is the house of prayer Pra)er, we all know is three fold 1'irst of all it is adoratiou-adoring God oui Maker und Cleator, acknovv lodging our own nothingness, acknou ledging God's sovereignty, and superiority, and omnipotence " W e adore thee, O God " Secondly, prayer is expiation How much expiation is necessary ' To what extent have we not oflended our great God' lune after tim" haie we wandered away from Him Tune after time haie we fallen into sin and violated our baptismal vows The church is the place to come and make atonement for our sins And, lastly, the church is the place of thanksgiving-for thanking God for the man) blessings we have received In that, we as Catholic», believe that the church is the house of God in a special manner, our holy faith teaches us that we liai e the sacred presence of Jesus Christ in our midst Our church is the tribunal of our blessed Lord Himself The great God is present here, not only spiritually, but Cor porallj "This IB My Bod) and This is My Blood " My delight is to dwell amongst men " Now, as we are about to la) the foundation stone of a cathedral, it is well for us to enter into the spirit of the ceremonv, and to be moved to do our utmost to help the completion of this building And the more we help inltlus, the more we shall be furl bel- ing the interests of Jesus Christ, end the interests of Jesus must be in the hearts of each one of ns We desire to see our blessed Lord's doctrine spread, and it is principally by means of the church that this will be done Let us rejoice to day > Let us rejoice to day upou this grnud solemnity, because it is another monument to the honour and glory of Jesus Christ about to be erected We who lov e God and lov e JesuB Christ must necessarily be rejoiced to see a monument growing up that is more worth) of our divine Saviour Our blessed Lord, when He caine into the world, caine in asa poor man, He was boin in astable in Bethlehem Tins church we are now in we may look upon as the stable of Bethle- hem At one time it may have been a gland building for Rockhampton , but now it has past its Bethlehem, and we are going to raise a monument-a house-more w orth) of our God To day is a da) that the Saints in Heaven will rejoice Toda) is one in which St Patrick will espcciall) rejoice rejoice to sec that the faith that he

out our blessed Lord s teaching-to i aisc up a house for the people and a house for God \ou should also remember that there is a moral-a lesson-in this , that there is not onl) a material church in the world, hut also a spiritual and corpoial church "Ye are the temples of the Hoi) Ghost ' says St Paul Each one of us is a church m ourselies We are the temples of the Holy Spirit To learn w hat kind of temples w e are, wc have but to look into otu souls aud see w hether the foundation be vi eil laid or badi) laid, to see whether we ure strong churches or ivhcthc" we are but pool temples of

soul iivij always keep our dnine Sanour and the Holy Trinity within us LAVING THE FOUNDATION STONT The cereinonj of laying the foundation stone took place in the afternoon, and was brief and a little burned It was to have taken pluce at half past three, and before tout hour a great crowd had gathered, teach ing nearly three thousand persons The Hibernian Societj walked in procession to the ground carrying their banner, and headed bj the Lake s Creek Baud A small platform had been erected close to the stand, which the committee intended should be occupied only b) ticket holders inv ited to be present But it was invaded from several sides, and got soineonvenientl) crowded that Bishop Cam and lue clergy were all crushed in a corner when carrying through the sen ice and cereinonj This was unfortunate, as the crowding prevented that oiderlincss and silence so befitting a religious Ben ice It also made it impossible for Bishop Cam to address the people at any length at the close The depositing of documents In the stone--one of thcchief parta of suchucersmoliy- had also to be omitted. The hole in the stone had boen duly cut by the conti actor, but it would hale taken much too long to fill und seal it then Tins will he done latir Bishop Cam, who had some difficult) m making his way through the ctowd, did not reach the platform till nearly four o clock The platform, it has been said, was ciondcd Amongst those present were the Hon J Ferguson, M L C , »Mr G S Curtis, M L A , Dr 1) S Mac donald, Dr Faulkner, and Messrs 1 Kell), J OSImnes), S W Hurtle), H Tiddes, J H Allen, 1* Power, G \> Greenish, P J M'Laughlin, B Talici, D Martin T Wjnne, M Bolton, E L Huitnn, and J Pattison Mr Kelleher, the contractor, was in charge of the stone, which was ull m readiness, Mr H lernet, the foreman stonemason, directing the men Bishop Cam -who was assisted b) the Rev Fathers Belton, Ilormcl, Lor ctucci, und ¡Vurahuer haling assumed Ins robes and mitre, and taken his pastoral stuff, blessed the stone, and thcu read certain praycis und psalms uoiial in sue Ii u coremonj, including the LituliJ of the Saints The stone baling been lowered and placed in posi tion by Mr Ferrier, the Bishop touched it with a sill ci trowel, wliieh had been pre sented b> Mr T H Harris, and declared it welland 1 rilli laid. The trowel, it maybe mentioned was presented in anticipation of the visit of Archbishop Dnnne and was to have carried the usual inscription, but owing to Dr Dunnes non arnval it was not inscribed An insenptn n however, is to be placed upon it, and it will then be pre tented to liishup Cam After the «tone had been laid. Bishop Cam brieflj addressed those in attendance He said, "I am most gialeful for und gratified by lout presence heic today Finie will not allow me to sa) the fen words I would have wished, but I thank J ou for my own put and on behalf of the commit tee, and I trust that the cathedral will be a monument not onlj to Rockhampton but to the Central Division that ali will rejoice in its erection, mid that )ou will all meet with a reward foi your effoits in assisting us to erect such a noble building It is impossible for me to speak to such a large Cloud, and in the midst nf such excitement Time is passing and people will be in a huir) to go away Let us proceed then with the work which is neccssari foi the prosecution of the erection of this build ing, that is the collection of the money w Inch you are about to gue A silver salier was then placed on the stone, and was quicklj piled up with cheques, bank notes, gold, and silver The people had a difficult) in getting forward, but this was accomplished in time, Bishop Cam announcing the gifts in a loud hcartj loice and culling on all who were prepared to assist to help at once Mr Kell) was in charge of the Balver At the eloBe u was found that a total of £10>0 had been placed on the salier, und promises for £3o0 additional had been given making u total of £1400 paid and promised A list of the subsciibers was taken, but the committee tequcst that this should not be published heie, they preferring to announce them by advertisement, when they will be able for mall) to thank all who assisted them in this way The list will be published in a du) or two EVENING SERVICE In the evening St Josephs Church was againcrondcd lather Belton again preached, taking foi his text the wolds, Hoi) Tattler, I pra) that the) may be one us \ou and I are one The benediction of the most Blessed Saetament was given b) Bishop CUDI, who ivas assisted b) Euther Plormel The music was agaiu ver) fine Mr B \ Kavanagh sang Bassuci S CK/HS 4 nnnain as a solo, the O ^alutans was sung bv Mis Macdouald, and Mr Sänke) sang Zingerellis Laúdate AU three solos weic rendered in fine voice and manner
