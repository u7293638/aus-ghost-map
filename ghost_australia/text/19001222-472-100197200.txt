A SOLDIER'S MOST STORY. This Is a True Story' told 'by an Old Pensioner to ? former Chaplain of Ohelsea Hospital. In the year 1799 there was a large garri son at Dover as there was at that tune a constant expectation of an attack from France. There were six battalions at Dover, four of which were quartered in the Castle. On January 14th there happened an event which made a great unpression on the garri son, and which was never explained. Among the men whose duty was sentry-go on that night was Giles Markbam, a native of Tewkesbusy, who was what is called 'a character.' A bold, boisterous, rollicking fellow, he always loudly expressed a dis belief in things which were not vouched for by his own senses. On the night of January 14th, 1799, Giles Markham wont on to take his turn of sentry duty at eleven o'clock, and he was to be at his post until one in the morning. The air was cold and bracing. Within the guardhouse a large fire blazed merrily, and tho men were merry too. Markham, who was always the leading spirit among his comrades, was full of fun, and had entertained his comrades with many a story and jeBt. At length his turn for duty came, and be reluctantly turnod out. Duf ness fell upon the guardhouse when he left, and most of the men dropped into a doze. Tho fire was beginning to bum low when Buddenly the voice of the BCntry at the guardhouse-door was heard calling out, and was awake in a minute, and the intruder was seen to be Giles Markham. His cheeks were white, his limbs trembled, his firelock, which he had brought with him, fell with a crash to the ground. The whole of the guard were by this time alarmed, and all crowded round the man and asked in one voice - 'What's the matter, Markham 1 What has haqpened V ' I have seen my mother,' gasped the un happy man. : ' Keen the devil !' said the sergeant. ' And suppose you have, why did you qnit your post? ' Was I to go into the sentry-box while my mother was here ?' demanded Markham, shaking from head to foot as if in an ague fit. ' I toll yon, I couldn't do it — no, not if it were to save my life.' 'It won't do, Markham,' said the sergeant, i Recollect that there are such things as the Articles of War. It won't do to crack your jokes at the expense of them.' But Markham's manner so impressed the men that some of them almost unconsciously noted tho timo by the guardroom clock, ft memorandum was made of the time. ' I am sorry for you, Markham,' said the sergeant, ' but this must be reported to the officer, and you must take the consequences. ' ' I don't care what the consequences may be, or to whom yon report me,' he replied. When the officer arrived he, of course, de manded an explanation. Markham, who had by this time recovered his self-composure, then gave the following account of his ad venture — ' You know where my post was,' he said, ? on the platform of Number Five battery, which overlooks the sea. The sentry whom 1 relieved reported ' All well.' Over tho surface of the Channel, as far as my eyes could reach, not a thing was moving. The noises from the town grew every moment less and less, and at last they died away, so that when the clocks struck twelve there was not a sound except the roar of the eoa. I have often done duty on thut post before, but never have I felt the silenco as I did to-night. I was thoroughly depressed by the stillness and loneliness around me. And then I fell a-thinking. 1 thought of my past life, and I knew thnt it had not been all it oupl't to have been. I thought of my mother, and I remembered how she used to weep over my father's loose life — and it was a very loose life — and how she used to pray tnai x nngnt turn oik a netter man man ne was. Poor mother 5 I stood beside the gnn, and wept like a haby as I thought of her, and of what she would think of me now. After a time the feeling wore off, and I laughed at myself for giving way to silly sentiment alism. I faced about and walked to the end of my beat, and then, feeling tired, made for the sentry-box. Sir, you may not believe me, but as there is a heaven abovo us, there at tho box stood my mother. She was pale, and looked at me wit h an expression of sorrow that cut ine to the heart. I was glued to the sppt. I could not move. I heard her \\--\w. She said, 'This day twelve months «-c Miiui meet again.' The words smote me, and !, who was never frightened before, quiifci- 1 with fear — fear of what 1 know not. I ti-iH to speak, but couldn't. At length 1 J ?- 1 1 1 - . 1 feeling return to my legs, and I i-)lwn5. Believe me as you like, every word iiave said, sir, is true.' 'You have told a strange story .'.rl; bam,' said the officer, ' to account ? ir commission of a serious military offence. But I will do this much for you. A prisoner you must be, and a report must be sent in to morrow to the colonel ; but he shall be told your tale, and as you have been a good soldier I will beg his leniency for you. You arc a native of Tewketbury, you 6ay. Does your mother live there?' 'I have every reason to suppose so,' answered Markham. ' It is years since I have seen her or written to her.' 'Very well,' said the officer, 'your mother shall be written to ; and your fate will depend on the answer.' Markham was kept a prisoner that night, and was reported next morning. Two Utters were despatched by the colonel, one to Markham s mother, and another to the clergyman of the parish in which she was ! supposed to reside. In due course there! came back answers to both letters. One; was in the handwriting of Markham's father, j and the other from the parson. The latter - stated that he had received an intimation the very morning when the colonel's letter : reached him that the woman concerning whom the inquiries had been made was to be buried next day. Markham, senior, in his letter stated that his wife had died at half-past twelve on the night of January 14th. The news made so much impression on the colonel that Markham was released. : Time rolled on until a year had gone, and Markham's regiment was at Ashford. When January 14th came rouid again Markham seemed as healthy as ever. He' had gone through a hard fatigue dnty in the day, and when bedtime came he gladly tumbled in, saying a cheery ' Good-night to his com rades. That was at ten o'clock. Some two hours and a half alterwards one of the men of Markham's company, who had had leave to be late, came m, and was a bit noisy. Borne of the men woke up, and Markham's voice was heard saying, 'I am coming, mother.' It was 12.80 on the 14th January. ' Markham was found dead in his bed the next morning, with a peaceful, happy look in his face.
