1 Chai-teh YI. . ? . MICKEY KEANE. ? ' Spring it is cheery, '; i.-f.ci.'Wj .Winter is dreary. ' Greon.'lcoy^s'hang, but the brown must fly ; ....?-. ;,v When he's forsakon ? ? Withered and shaken, What can an old man do but die.' . Iloon. The news of the loss of the Erin ? caused 'general consternation, many of the.missing were people of consideration ; and-m&rk; in the world, and it was in . soinei.sort a public calamity. ? Captain Tristraile read it over his comfortable barrack breakfast, and his ; lip curled. as ,. he ;saw.: the name of the man whom he. had driven to his death. ' My .revenge is sweet and full,' he said with.. a , grin -.smile. 'I would rather hav.e.:p.uttia;.bullet through him though. : ; ; Afteriaty'tbis. is best, — there's no publicity in this thing, and all the world hears of a duel. The sea .tells . no f ales.' He turned to the paper again and was soon absorbed in the details of the catastrophe. A knock at the door roused him, and he uttered ' come in.' ' Well, Ticks, what is it ?' .' An old man, sir, asking to see you ; I can't get rid of him.' 'You must; I cannot be bothered with any old men now ; see what he wants and send him away.' ' It's no use, sir ; he says he wont go till he has seen you ; says his name is Micky Keane, and that you knew him in Ireland.' . . 'Oh, I can't remember all the boors who touched their hats to an officer in that confounded country; however yon may let him come in, since he is so very importunate. I'll soon get rid of him.' ' Now what can he want ?' he thought as the servant left the room, 'is O'Grady's marriage blown, I wonder. Here Keane, my man, what brings you to London ? Sit down.' ' Thank ye sir, I'd rather stand. I came to London ? ' 'To what? Oh, I see you want Dicks away. Get out Dicks, and away from the door, do you hear.' Dicks obeyed, as though he were used to such peremptory orders and Mickey went on.' ' I came to know the truth about this, sir.' ' He laid the letter he had received, certificate, bank note and all upon the table, and he waited for tho captain's answer. ' ' The truth is, Mr .Keane, I don't quite understand you, — you have it there, I am sorry to say,' pointing to the certificate. 'I don't mean that, captain; that tells me that I shall never look upon my darling's face any more on earth ; that's not what I want to hear about. But my Nora was an honest wife and a loving mother, with a k'nd husband that loved the very ground she walked upon, and I want to know why you had aught to do with her, and why you sent yonder bank note to me ?' . , 'Did you come to London for that ?' ' Isn't that enough ? There was that \- in the letter when the priest read it to me, that seemed to whisper that there, was more in it than death, for me. to .know, of. How did sho come whore she was when I know her husb«ind left her in a good house ? What call had you to be going about her ? She hated and feared you enough in the old days to make you keep away.' ? ' Sho didn't hate me at last,' Tris traile suid with an expression on his face perfectly fiendish. 'You had better have, stayed at home, Keane, and not sought for the truth. Young girls left alone and neglected as she was, naturally turn to their old friends. Nora left the house, you speak of of her own free will.' ? . 'And with you ?' There was an expression in the old man's eyes at which . even Tristraile re coiled as he asked the question. He did not reply in words, but nodded care lessly ; the hand of Mickey Keane came down upon his shoulder with a hard grip. . ' It is a lie .'' he said. ' It's true, my man — you would have it, and you have.' ' It is a lie !' Mickey repeated, I see it in your eyes. ' Captain Tristraile, I'm a poor old man, and you are . young, rich, and powerful. I tell you, tho day will come yet, when I'll prove my dear child's innocence to the world, and show you up for what you are, a scoundrel and a coward !' ' You'll have some trouble. Don't you think you had better have taken a little more care ot her while she was alive ?' ' Care for her ? Who ever cared for a child as I did for my pretty Nora. When you were trying to entice her (as you did try), I saw her married to a good and true gentleman ; he's in Lon don now, and I'm going to find him; may be, he'll have something to say to you as well as me.' ' I don't think you'll find him in London ; he's in a much quieter place. You see I know all about it — see there.' He tossed the paper over to where Keane still stood, who looked at it with very vague misgiving — ' I've not been taught like you,' he said. ' You'll have to speak out what you mean.' The captain read out the few lines that told of Horace O'Grady's death, in a cold clear voice, and added, ' I don't think there is much to be feared from him.' Mickey Keane put his hand to his forehead. 'I can't say,' he said feebly. ' Truth is strong and mighty to save, and it will come out in the end ; I don't think the Almighty will let me die till he's seen it righted. Good clay, sir.'? He tottered feebly out, leaving the note upon the table ; Tristraile called him back. ' You had better take it,' he said. ' It can't do you harm, and you will havo an expensive journey.' .' If I paid for it with that I should expect to die. on the road,' wns the quiet answer, ' I have enough of honest means left.' He looked so pale as he loft the room that the captain called his servant. 'Dicks,' he said, 'make that old fellow drink a glass of ale before he goes, and never let him in again, do you hear ?' ' Very good, sir.' But Mickey would take nothing, and went his solitary way into the busy streets, intent only upon seeing where his child lay buried, and then returning to Ivis solitary home. The news of Horace O'Grady's death completely paraliscd him, and he walked just like a man in a dream. By dint of much asking he made his way to the City Road, but he felt sadly weak and ill. He had eaten nothing for many hours, and the ground seemed to reel under his feet. The street was slippery too, with trodden down snow, and the increasing rush of vehicles and passengers bewil dered him. . . He strove to cross the road just op posite the house which had been burned, when he slipped and fell. There was a roar, of shouting, voices, an execration from the driver of a com ing cab, a crash, and he knew no more. It was only a common street accident, a broken leg, an injury to the head, and bruises, and in five minutes there was no trace left of the catastrophe, except the crowd, which followed the stretcher to the nearest hospital. ' .Little guessed Nora of all this as she lay' in the shelter of a stranger's house hold ; she woke with the .first grey dawn of a winter morning, and ar ranged her disordered dress for a far^ ther journey. The people of the house prepare! Ifor: her, and she forced herself to cat; she. must nurture her strength now for her: child's sake, but until she could: oldacr ? herself in the world's eyes from the stain which rested upon her name, she would be dead, as they . believed . her to be. .
