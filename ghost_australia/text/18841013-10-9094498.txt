VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. THEY SUBMARINE CABLE.] [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] MELBOURNE, SATURDAY. The spring meeting of the Victoria Ama tour Turf Club commenced this afternoon on the clubs course at Caulfield, under most unfavourable circumstances. The weather was miserably cold, and showers of rain fell at short intervals. The attendance, however, was a very satisfactory one, the grand stand being filled with ladies, while the saddling paddock and flat were largely patronised. Owing to the rain the course was rather dead, but not in the least sloppy. Albert the time for each event was slow, the racing was particularly good, and two or three of the finishes proved very exciting. Proceedings began with the Maldon Plate, won by Norfolk, who agreeably sur prison his friends by this time showing the form in public he had exhibited in private. Sinking Fund, with Harden in the saddle, bowled ovorYatcly in the First Hurdle Race, in which event the Tasmanian owned horses, West Coast and Western took part. The St. Alban's stable furnished the winner of the Great Foal Stakes with Ring- master, who started favourite. Neither the winner nor Geisha, who ran second, are engaged in the Maribyrnong: Plate. Norton, the rider of Phaou in the Foal Stakes, was disqualified for three months for disobeying the starter's orders. As gone ally anticipated, the honours attached to the Caulfield Guineas again went across to the sister colony of South Australia, but Sandal proved the " trump card" instead of Holono. The three placed fillies in the event are Adelaide owned, and each engaged in the V.R.C. Derby. The time-limit. 50JBOC-is 4sec. lower than when Sardius won last year, but, as stated above, the course was a trifle holding. Backers spotted the right horse in the Findon Harriers' Gold Vase, the veteran Abdallah finishing second. A good field came to the post for the last event of the day -Toorak Handicap Precious Stone (who thus incurs a 7lb. penalty in the Moonee Valley Cup), carrying off the stake, with two Tasmanian-owned horses Motor and Prodigal-as his nearest attendants at the finish. Appended are details of the running -. . MAIDEN PLATE, Of 100 Sovs., added to a sweepstakes of 3 sovs. each, for maiden horses, 3yrs. old and upwards. One mile. Mr. J. G.
