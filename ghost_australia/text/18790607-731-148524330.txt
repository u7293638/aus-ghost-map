The Buried Ship. The wild winter wind, and tbe restless wave, Havg upraised a wreck f-om its ocean grave. Down'at Aqaebogne, rishere ased to show Where the Mars went down fifty years ago. 'Twas a trading brig from a tropic shore That saok frotn sight to the ocean floor, By the sexton, sand, baried well and deep, Till the winter storm called her up from Sleep. ? Like a ghost she came Seaward-looking eyes Saw aa outline new on the sea and skies, Watching fisher-folks, half afraid, drew near Till the / saw her decks through tbe water clear. Then the wise old Baits by the firesides, said, With many a shake of each whitened head, They remembered well that October blow And the sinking wreck tifLy years ago,' Old ship, awaked from your solemn Bleep On the sifted sand of the Bilent deep, Do yon come for news from the high main land That northward crescents yon strip of sand 7 Have you come to watch with a jealous eye How ihe wingless steamship bustles by ? Hive you heard the call of the cable's thrill As it pulsed some echo of human will ? Have tbe parted lioks of a riven chain Jangled down to tell of a great wrong Blain? Have the rnd iy drops of a soldier's blood Never bronght war-news on the ebbing flood? Nor wave, astray from the Gulf-stream's tide, Told of yellow gol i where the sunsets hide â€” Never home-sick heart 'neath a miner's tent i From the far Sierras a cloud-kisB sent? Do you miss the souls into harbor passed Since the 6anbeains gilded your ga lant mast? Through the rapid flight of the baried years Heard you never of stranded hopes and fears? So, finding the world would not come to thee. Hast tbou come, old ship, for thyself to see ? Like a sleeper sound, who has lain too long) Wakened op at last by a fisher's song.
