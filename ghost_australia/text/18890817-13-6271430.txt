, THE GHOST OF THE OCEAN KING. 2 to----' By the Captain on the AUivror Stvr ROAllU " I tell you Anstey, she was just the very prettiest little girl ever I set eyes on Clipper built so to speak My word, she was a spanker I'm clean gone this time, my boy that little blue eyed girl up at the Cherlngee did the job Tell you what, old man, when I get a ship-" ' Well, but sir, I interrupted ruthless) Old Dicky Sampson, our first mate, was such a good natured fellow, you might say anything to him and he was in a chronic state of falling in love though luckily, perhaps, his affections were not confined to the Prime young woman It wasgenerallyacaaeof 'cop sail sheets ' with him and I felt pretty certain that by the time we had crossed the line he would have entirely forgotten that pretty little girl up at the Chenmree as completely as he had forgotten the dark eyed one he had made so much moon over at parting when we left the Port of London outward bound six months before " Well, but, sir, I ventured to hint " what about that other girl-the London one, I mean ' 1 Hang you, Anstey said Sampson with emphasis, " am c telling you this is quite different quite another thing altogether Just his en for a moment now while I explain it required a good deal of effort to listen too for it was a dirty night in the Bay of Bengal A regular gale was howling and shrieking through the rigging, and the ship was scudding before it under top "gallant sails The Ocean King was a ending ship, 2,000 tons burden, three days out from Calcutta homeward bound, laden with jute " Oh, He borne deane home it's home I long to be sang the men for a shanty at their work, and I think we were all glad, alter the three long, hot months at Calcutta, to find ourselves fairly afloat once more Dick hampton, the first mate, was not, per bops, ob glad as he ought to have been-his head was full of the girl up at the Chenngee, and I, Bob Anstey, the third mate, didn a much care, certainly, whether we were out ward or homeward bound, for my home was in far away Australia, and I knew the Ocean lung was t at all likely to sail in that direction. The skipper had a wife in Plymouth and I knew he was heartily longing to be home again and as for the second mate, he was a mooney sort of chap, who was no sooner afloat than he wished himself ashore again But the ordinary hand before the mast is a queer sort of creature, and I very much doubted whether any one of the crew, out of the whole "3 of them had a home to go to in England or elsewhere, for all they sang with such a will, "Oh, it's home, dearie home," and put such pathetic emphasis into their description of their longing for the " bonny north c juntree " There was one who had knew I had not forgotten how the boys was fair haired young wife had come down to the ship before she sailed on her voyage, and clung to her grizzled, middle aged husband, clung to him and kissed him, and cried over him, and implored him to come back to her-to take care of himself, and come back to her And then, as to tug slowly hauled us off, I remembered how she had stood there among the cheering crowd, waving her handkerchief and trying to force back the tears that would come into her pretty blue eyes There was no one I cared particularly about to see me off, so I watched her till she and all the rest of the crowd faded into one indistinguishable blurred mass, and then I turned and saw the bosun, a tall, raw boned Scotchman, fur lively wiping his eyes with the back of his hand "It hard, air, main hard 'heBaidnpologcti cully"toleavea weebitthingliketb italia) her lane, and then encouraged a little perhaps, by my sympathy, he told me all about his wooing and how that pretty little girl I had seen had taken him and loved him, grizzled old shellback as he was, and how this was to be his last voyage, for he couldn't bear to leave her alone, and please God, in six months' time had be safe at her side again, and she 'd be safe with his barn at her breast How he used to harp on that same old shanty He was always humming it in his deep bass voice ' And I thought how I sailed when the cradle It stood rea ty for the pretty little babe that has never seen its daddy And if it be a lass she shall wear a golden ray., And If it be a lad he shall live to serve his mine is rich his buckles and his boots and his little jacket blue In 21 -via walk the quarter deck as his daddy used to do. And te a home, dearie home on its home I want to ! My topsails are hoisted and I must out to sea, For the oak and the ash and the bona) birches tree Tin is to all agreed ing green in the north countree Oh its home, dearie home Ah, near the castle we build and the plans we lay and how many of them come to anything" Whenever Bill Thompson got a chance he talked to me about the bona) young wife and the child that was coming, and all that he intended to do when this, his last, voyage should be over And it was over sooner than he p\ pected Toor Bill 'Thompson, the best seaman on the Ocean long We were running down our easting one stormy day in the beginning of February 1 he Bea was run ning mountains high, and the wind, like some creature in pain, was shrieking and wailing throughly the rigging Every moment it seemed to me the good ship must go to the bottom as sea after sea towered above us and threatened to engulf us, and yet she sprung forward just in time, and we were saved Then one great green sea caught her and swept her fore and all As the tons' weight of water came tumbling on board 1 hung on to the bulwarks for dear life, and yelled a hard I \ needed cry of warning to the watch on deck The bo sun was close beside me, and I saw him grab a grating which was washing pair. 'Then the ship gave a lurch and almost before I realised what was happening, grating and boy un were swept overboard under my very eyes I saw his white face turned despairingly up to the sky, and the pale, watery sunshine gleamed on his streaming oilskins, then the cruel sea swept him away to leeward and I knew that never on this earth should we see our shipmate again, that the fair haired wife might watch and wait and long, but never would the bairn be had hoped for see its daddy till the sea shall give up her dea 1 It was useless to think of saving him, we scarce dared hope to save ourselves, and when at last we had ridden out the gale safely we were hundreds of miles away from the place where he had (gone overboard So we went on our voyage, and the bosun was forgotten, as dead men are forgotten, whether on sea or land and his memory was only delayed for a brief space when, on arrival at Calcutta, His gear was sold by auction at the capstan head for the benefit of the poor young widow, and, for the honour of eudora be it told, bought at about 10 times its value I wrote home and broke the news as gently as I could to his wife, and then-well, I am no better than the rest of us, I suppose so 1 thompson passed completely out of my thoughts, almost as if he had never been But we had scarcely cast off from the tug, and were not a days sail from Calcutta, when, much to my astonishment Ina memory was revived amongst us A rumour arose, how I know nor, and that from one of the crew and then from another I heard that the ship was haunted, und haunted by the ghost of the poor Do a un who had been lost overboard 1 more than four months before away to the south and of the stormy Cape of Good Hope. Sailors are proverbially super stations, and it was in vain to protest, in vain to argue , the rumour spread like wild fire and before the day was out there was not a man in the fo'c sale who was not prepared to swear he had seen the ghost, and told of its doings in awe-struck and bloodcurdling tone-. It was a very orthodox ghost, I found on Inquiry, a ghost arrayed nil In white, which shivered and moaned and made its principal habitat right for'ard, somewhere about the fore pen It worried me not a little this ghost, the men were so scared about it, and I was puzzling my brains over It I as I stood on the flying bridge, closet) I wrapped up in my oilskins, nominally listens ing as my superior officer, after his wont, spun an endless yarn about his latest love, the girl up at the Chennigee It was my watch on deck the second match and about half past 12 a.m., a dirty night, with the full j moon showing only fitful gleams of light through the dense banks of clouds which almost covered the sky What could the ghost be' I wondered, lending only half an ear to Mr Sa ison s yarn I wanted to tell him about it when I got a chance, and ask his advice Of course, I in no way dreamt of connecting the supposed ghost with our lost shipmate Still it it wash it a ghost what was it and some thing was certainly iri,_htetiiii_. the men Should I ' anstey, you're not listening " "Persian! sir She gave you one of those big white lilies-' "is, one of those big white lilies, and-' sang ' bang ' bang and a sail out for and was Hopping i fell to ribbons "What the devil is that cried the first mate, forgetting for the moment all about his sweetheart and the lines she had given him I ran forward to see, just as the man on the look out yelled "jib sheet whip carried, sir ' "All right, lay along here Haul the inner jib down ' My order was promptly obeyed, and the sail was hauled down "Out on the boom, there four of you, and muzzle that sail ' i hen 1 went aft and reported to the first mate I " the whip huB parted, sir ' "All right get it spliced ' ' It's not worth it sir. It's all splice now , devil a bit of sound rope in it " "Humph! Oh' well, you'd better go down the forepeak and cut off another length '1 here's a coil of new Manila on the starboard side right for'ard " Now, the forepeak had been in my thoughts ever since I came on deck that evening at the domicile of the suppose 1 ghost, but now for the time being it went clean out of my head, and I burned for and, culling to two of the watch to follow me One of them was an Irishman named Mickey Doolan, and the other a very black little nigger commonly called, why I know nor, " Gooseberry the forepeak, as perhaps some folks do not know, is right away for and under the fo'cslehead The boat deck is about eight feet down, and new rope sails, &c; , are kept there. The next deck is 10 feet lower and here is stowed the coal for the donkey engine, and the whole place, both upper and lower deck, is about as dirty) dark, and uninviting as any place well can the 1 There is a very small hatch and the iron ladder leading down 13 perpendicular and very narrow. The two men followed me reluctantly, so reluctantly that the ghost flashed into my mind once more That troublesome ghost ' I certainly wasn't going to let it stand in the way of duty "Jump down below now, Gooseberry, and pass out that coil of manilla ' "Ay, ay, star and Gooseberry proceeded in the opposite direction " Where the-are you off to I shouted angrily ' Get a lamp sir," responded Gooseberry, with a niggers usual civility "Oh, hung a lamp, feel for it Look lively now ' Reluctantly Gooseberry came back, and very gingerly began to descend, Micky Doolan and I meanwhile leaning over the hatch and watching Our proximity ought to have given him courage, but, apparently, it did not Gooseberry,' I shouted Gooseberry, Where's that rope There was no answer for a moment or two , then Gooseberry reported "I Ryan t find it, sir" "Of course you can't 'Why don't you keep your mouth shut, and then you might have a chance to see over your lips. Go into the lower place Perhaps it's rolled on to the coals Look lively now, or we 'll have the skipper up wondering why that sail isn't set ' Very cautiously Gooseberry proceeded lower down, and stood on the coal, but he made no attempt to look for the rope My temper was giving out rapidly-the sail was still hanging away for ard and momentarily I expected the noise to fetch out the old man ' "Go further forward, ' I ordered "What on earth's the matter with you' Do you see any ghosts cruising round there Apparently I struck the right nail on the head, for Gooseberry gave one despairing glance up as I could see by the fitful moon light, which just caught his gleaming teeth and eyeballs Then he proceeded to obey ' Go down with that thing, Doolan, and see it you can't find the rope ' Doolan began to descend cautiously, and had just got down about six range, when the most awful yells rent the air, raid Gooseberry came flying to the foot of the ladder at the rate of 10 knots an hour, until he came into collision with Mickey Doolan who, being scared at the yells, neither moved up nor down Little Gooseberry, hardly noticing the obstruction, proceeded to climb up his legs, and then over his back and on to the deck Once there, he was just sailing aft, when I grabbed him by the throat and jammed him up against the windlass Now, sir, what the-do you mean by lifting up that tuneful voice, and making that row' Gooseberry collapsed promptly on to his knees " 1 ore Gawd, Mr Anstey, there a ghostly down that ' 'the fellow trembled all over His teeth were chattering and his eyes rolling and altogether his tenor was so real that I felt certain he at least believed in the visitor from the other world By this time the mate had come for ward and the rest of the watch were crowding round ' What a the matter, Mr Anstey) ' W by the deuce don't ) on letch along that rope ' ' beggared will know air Ibiathingsaja -I still had him by the collar, and leave him a little shake by way of emphasizing my dis pleasure He was limp and woe begone now -' there is a ghost down in the fore peak 'Oh that be-for a yarn Anyhow we II soon see, and it there is, out he goes He's not down on the manifest, and unless he can prove he's either seed or jute, dumped he'll be, as sure as my name Sampson Come along and see ' "Ay, ay, Sir Get a light there one of you I had made poor Gooseberry descend in Cimmerian darkness, but I was by no means anxious to do it myself A light was quickly brought, and we proceeded to descend, carrying the light I was slightly nervous I must confess It was a dismal hole enough 'The mournful creaking of the ship b timbers, the howling of the gale, the wash, wash of the waters racing past the banging of the sail overhead, were not sound calculated to inspire confidence to be sure, there was the burly first mate, standing bit Jin in his stockings close behind me, and it would be a daring ghost, I reflected, that would venture to tackle him Still I came first, and-well, if anything was wrong I should certainly have to bear the brunt of it, no retreat was possible, for the mate filled up all the gangway I thought of poor Bill Thompson, reflected that he and I had al was been good friends, and that it it were like ghost which had taken to such very uncomfortable quarters, it wasn't likely it would do me any harm "Goon Anstey, ' Ban! the mate, giving me a friendly little push from behind, ' You unit afraid of ghosts are your Thus adjured I slipped down onto the coals, and held up ray lantern At first I could see nothing, though I felt with some satisfaction a coil of rope just. my feet The mate followed me, and for a moment we stood silent till our eyes got accustomed to the light Then to my horror I frankly confess it the blood fairly curdled in my veins I saw right in front of us a tall figure clad all in white solemnly raising its spectral hand -I assure you I could have sworn it was a spectral hand-to its forehead, and like Gooseberry I jumped to the conclusion that it was some supernatural visitant from another world How it was I did it drop the lantern and I see I'm sure I don't know, but I do know my tongue clove to the out of my mouth, and I couldn't have littered a word to save my life Not so the mate He was afraid of no ghostly visitor, and much to my relief he stepped forward and caught the white robed thing by the collar "Who the devil are you'" he asked in prosaically angry) tones. Then the ghost opened its mouth and spake spake in good English too No one but myself will ever know how small I felt, for to no one did I ever think it necessary to confess in) leavE Please, sir," said the ghost very humbly, " I stowed five) " Oh, you did, did you' Well, I swore anything that wasn't seed or jute should be dumped, and dumped you'll be for a certainty. Come Out of that lively now You've turned that ing the colour of pea soup " His watch crowded round as we two came on deck with theldiost-a woe begone soldier, in while regulation clothes, now somewhat scorched by a too close acquaintance with the coals The mite held on to him like grim death, as it he momentarily expected him to bolt, and even Gooseberry forgot her fears and peered curiously into his face. Then, by dint of questioning, the mate got the whole story out of him There wasn't much to tell He didn't like India He was Hick of soldiering, so he had deserted from Fort William and having a friend in our cook, had stowed away in the Ocean lung, and the doctor had been feeding Inmforthe last three days ' Not that he had required much feeding, for he had been so horribly Bea sick it was no wonder that the report had gone abroad that the ghost had moaned and wailed A ii) how, f think after three days in the forepeak held have given his eyes to find himself back in barracks He told us his name was William Hughes I don't suppose for one moment it was, but it answered as well as any other, and by that he was entered on the books as ordinary seaman, and found a sailor's life, I'll bet, about twenty times harder than a lodger's " And that was the most prosaic end of our ghost, though amongst the crew Hughes was always known as Bill '1 Thompson's Ghost, which, being rather Ion.: for general use, was, as a rule, shortened into the endearing term of "ghostly " Poor Bill Thompson ' By the time we reached London I don't suppose there was one of us aboard remembered him Even who had taken most interest in him, forgot him entirely, till one day when I had gone down to Greenhithe to visit the old " Worcester " Of course, I find carefully for gotten it was holiday time, so none of the fellows were aboard and most of the masters and officers were away to Then as I landed again disappointed on the old causeway I had landed on so often as a boy), it suddenly occurred to me how the poor bo'sun had told me that he had left his wife in lodgings in Greenluthe. I had the address, and having nothing in particular to do, I the right I'd go and look her up and tell her about her husband. The house was soon found , a very very humble house in a very humble street, but it looked neat and clean I knocks d at the door, and a middle aged woman with a wrinkled and worn face opened the door to me "Does Mrs Thompson live here'" I asked "Sir'" she said, interrogatively, as if she hadn't heard "Mrs Thompson her husband went away last December-bo'aun of the Ocean King, bound for Calcutta " " Dear-sir-you ain't her husband." "No, I'm not He's drowned fell over- board I'm one of the mates of the Ocean King ; I thought I'd just come and see how she was gettuignlong " "Dear, dear, drownded is he-an' she died in childbed three months after he was gone Fined she did, mi' never held up her head again " "And the child '" "Oh, it was a puny things he), unit died day after its mother. We buried 'em together. "I here was a letter i home for her after she was dead I put it in the lea cuddy, and kept safe Will you have it .' f nodded, and she produced it-my own letter written about the time the poor thing lay dying Ah, well, I was glad she had never got it. " If. a hard life, the sea," went on the woman, standing in the doorway, a hard die-hard on them as follows it, is hard on them as stops behind My husband and three sons they all followed the sea, as' the wear on it is like to kill me sometimes " Indeed, I could well believe her worn and weary, silo looked like a woman who had kept many a long veil "My man," he went on, was castaway and lost on the coast of Newfoundland, an' two of the boys they sailed for China and the ship was never heard of no more, in' here's the last, God bless him, he's just come back from Austral) A lad was rolling up the street, his hands in his pockets, his cap on the back of his head Cheery and jolly he looked His father's and brothers' late had evidently in no wise daunted him I bid his mother Good bye, and strolled on, but I paused a moment and listened to the boy's song "says-The, 'My love, I am dead and gone ' Long lands, lowlands. and on my head the, vo put a stone Good be, in love, in the lowlands. ' A GREAT ACTOR DEAD. American papers report the death in Boston, on the 17th of June, of John Gilbert, an actor who, in his particular line which was the same as that of the best and second Farren-was without a peer in the United States He was what is technically known as an " old man " in the American theatres at 18, and be continued to play The line of characters for 50 years When he first appeared as an actor George the youth was on the throne of England, and Charles the Tenth on that of 1 rupee, '1 alma was in the zenith of his fame in Paris, and Edmund Kean was thrilling London audiences by the electricity of his genius in the greatest of Shakspeare's creations John Gilbert's earliest impersonation was presented at the Tremont theatre, Boston, in 1828, and his last was in ISfeS, when he played Sir Anthony) Absolute in conjunction with Mrs John Drew as Mrs Malaprop, and Mr Joseph Jefferson as Bob Acres lila repertoire comprised 120 characters and during his professional career he was associated with some of the most famous actors and actresses of his time, both English and American, including Macready), Edwin forrest, Ellen Tree, Charlotte Cush man, Tyrone Power, the Wallncks, the Keeley, Blake, Placide, Warren, and Jeder 9on. Ten years ago his jubilee as an actor was celebrated at Wallack's Theatre in New York, when all that was most distinguished in literature, science, art, and the drama assembled to do honour to the veteran, who had qualified himself to excel as an actor by playing all sorts of characters outside of that which nature and art had made peculiarly his own lines, as he once remarked, he had sustained every one of the parts in " Macbeth, ' except those of the Queen and the waiting gentlewoman, and all the parts in "Julius Caesar," except the boy Lucius His greatest histrionic achievements were Sir Peter 'I gaze, Sir Anthony Absolute, Sir Oliver Surface, Sir John PaletaiT, Sir William 1 and love, Malvolio, Polonius, Sir Robert Bramble, Autolycus, Lord Oalehv, Sir Harcourt Courtly, Jesse Rural, Old Hardcastle, Adam Sir Edward Mortimer, and Dr Cantwell Old and experienced actor as he was, John Gilbert never went on the stage in a new character or on an opening night without nil attack of stage fright, and when he made his first appearance at the Princess's Theatre in London as Sir Robert Bramble, in 1845, Ina nervousness was so excessive that it was feared the curban would have to be dropped Charles Kemble, then an old man, once said to him, " We can never hope to be perfect in our art, sir I never go to the theatre without learning something' And this was John Gilbert's own policy and practice, and while in England he as seriously visited the theatres, and studied the acting, giving it as his opinion that there never had been such companies as were then to be seen at Drury-lane and the Haymarket, and never would be again He also visited Paris, and profited largely by his observations of the methods of French actors Born on the 27th of February, 1840, at the house in Boston adjoining that in which Charlotte Ciiahtnau first saw the light John Gilbert evinced from his earliest childhood a passionate predilection for the stage , but, after having received a fair education, he was placed in his mule's softgoods warehouse at the age of 14 Four years afterwards, he Bteathily applied for, and obtained, an engagement at the Old Tremont Theatre, where he made it tolerably successful debut as Jallrer, in " Venice Preserved Hut after playing Shylock and Sir Edward Mortimer, he was relegated to small ports, which induced him to quit that theatre and join a strolling company), and this sort of life he led for five years, with very little profit to himself, but with immense navan tage to his knowledge and experience as an actor. Then he went back to Boston, where he played with increasing approbation for another five years, and came to be recognised us one of the ornaments of his profession New York audiences confirmed the verdict of the New England Athena, and from the year 1810 up to within a short period of his death the late John Gilbert was universally recognised as unapproachable in many of her characters and admirable in all.
