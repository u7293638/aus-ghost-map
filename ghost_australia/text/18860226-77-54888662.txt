THE number of societies «ith which every important British and Colonial city now sw al ins is something fearful and wonderful to contemplate, and every day new ones are coming into being The foundations are very easily laid-all that is wanted being an lion secretary, a free lunch, a minute book, and a long felt public want Societies of all kinds hil the columns of the daily press with their announcements-Highland Societies, Cockney ¡societies, ¡societies of Men who drop their H s, Societies for prosecuting Clerks who embezzle the Petty Cash, Societies for the suppression ot temporary Insanity, and last, though not least London now possesses a Society for the Investigation of Ghosts, which will possibly prove more valuable than all the others combined The funds of the last named institution are spent in renting deserted houses, and the members pass their nights in <lamp corndois, and behind moth eaten tapestry, or lying under bedsteads, or squinn ing up haunted chimneys, in the vain attempt to catch hold of even the tail of a spectral night shirt, so that they may stop and question some visitant from the spheres Banshees hate risen to an alarming premium in the market, but probably the Land League has driven them from their ancient haunts, and v ery few are obtainable As yet the society haB only one goblin to its credit This ap pantion is now serving a term of three years penal seivntude, for investigation proved that it vi as in the habit of haunting other people s ancestral hails in prcfeience to its own , it had also a fondness for family plate, and paid regular quarterly dividends to its fortunate proprietors In spite of their ill fortune, however, the members of the Investigation ¡society have accumulated a great quantity of v aluable information about Bpmts, and some of tho facts they have ascertained aie worthy of preservation The popular idea about the non material character of goblins proves to be well founded, and there is reason to believe a whola spectral genealogical tree, if boiled down, would not yield more than an ounce of Liebig's Kxtract of Ghost The cause of their w ulktug about the earth instead of remaining peacefully underground, is uiid to be irrigation or rather want of drainage No ghost can spend his whole time in a damp tomb without contracting an illness which might prove fatal, and if he conies out to dry now and then «ho can blame him The hollowneBB of Ins tones when he condescends to speak is owing to his having nothing in side him , literally, he is " filled with the east wind, and not having seen a good duiner for, perhaps, two centuries, it is not surprising that he is somewhat empty The partiality for churchyards manifested by modern goblins is the duect result of over crowding Coffins are often buried two or three deep nowadays, and when the senior ghost, who is naturally at the bottom of the pile, wants to revisit his ancestral home, he has no means of escape except by forcibly ex pelling those above But it frequently happens that the latter have no home to re visit , a spectre w hich ended its days In the poorhouse, for example, has no desire to return there an i take a fond look at the skilly and the parish beadle so they loaf about the cemetery and read the inscriptions on the tombstones, until the overbearing Bpectre who expelled them thinks fit to re turn W hethcr apparitions have tbeir re fular evenings out the society has not yet een able to ascertain, and though It is taken for granted they are built of some substance, howev er impalpable, no reliable analysis has been made The ordinary ghost, it is found does not get his clothes made to measure He is invariably dressed In slops of the sloppiest descnption, and is always holding np the tail of some nondescript garment lest it should tiip him up His aspect is sorrowful, as if he almost wishd he «rere alire . and hiB expression resembles nothing so much as that of a policeman who has been detailed to run in a fighting Irishman and a bull dog Some second rate spectres have been made out of a turnip with a light tnside, and tins species, when boiled, make excellent soup , hut these he beyond the sphere of the society s investigations, and do not require any detailed description heie
