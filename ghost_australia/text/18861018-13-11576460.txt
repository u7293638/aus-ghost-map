NOTES AND COMMENTS. ' A suburban parson, who has strong ideas Of the value attaching to his flock being well kept together, has lately endeavoured, to the great horror of the more old fashioned portion of those who sleep under him, to institute what is commonly called the social " The heinousness of his Crime is further enhanced by the fact that the place for assemblage is the schoolroom, a building con- secrated, if appears, to the object of impart ing so much religious instruction on Sunday afternoons as can comfortably be squeezed Into an hour and a quarter When the rev arena gentleman mooted the idea in the first instance, it was not very warmly received, and his suggestion that dancing might be indulged in with propriety was met with loud denunciations of the heterodoxy of his faith In vain did he urge that everybody duneed nowadays, and that the young people might as well have their flag.; under the patronage and in the presence of a clerk in holy orders as take their Terpsi phorean recreation under less saintly circumstances. It was not to be permitted The idea of a parson flying about as M.C was too much for the staid parishioners, who, while they gave was on the point of the "social," put down their collective foot firmly against dancing The first of these assemblages took place not so very long ago It was chiefly confined to young people, who, with all the ardour of youth, were determined to do things as they ought to be done. At one end of the schoolroom a stage was erected, and their pastor's piano safely hoisted on to it. The programme was one of songs, reel tations, and music, and when these were exhausted games followed 1 madly, games gave out, and ats reverence called on the a acrobats for a fresh game. From the end of the room came the job the words, "Yankee grab" The parson hailed the idea with delight, and was urgent in his inquiries as to how it was pitched, but directly it was explained to him that it was "slow game played in public houses," he, with nfwell bred whisper, closed the scene When the stage mob comes to that point in the play where it becomes necessary to express disapprobation, it gives vent to a moan and groan which is a hybrid between a very Belt Eolian harp and a fog horn sublimed by distance It may be indicative of the strongest passions of revenge, or of doleful lamentations at the grave of here, being uniform in character, or it might reasonably be assumed to mean that a beam had fallen on the stage carpenter, and was slowly squeezing the life out of line or that Hamlets father's ghost was in search of his son, and lamenting that he could not find him The knots of people who gathered in front of the V A T C offer about to clock on Saturday morning lifted up their voices and greed when they saw that the mysterious horse had been scratched d a few minutes before-not that they had lost an. money thereby, for most of them had not, but they expressed their sentiments that it was not a fair thing to keep him in so long and "milk the public. What were the nigh from a sea which led led to all the mar kets manipulations will probably remain in gloom, but the first great handicap of the year has not given very reassuring promises Lord Byron was opinion that there was a pleasure in the pathless woods and a rapture on the lonely shore, but he never tried going to Caulfield on n Cup day by train, or he would have certainly put it down as an initial taste of the infernal regions, while the money back would have provided the full banquet There is nothing to show that the crowd is differently composed, but there seems to be about three times as much rush and scramble at Prince's bridge as at Spencer street, with a far less number of people to cause the difficulty But if the journey there WItH bad the return was infinitely worse Far as) many people were allowed on to the platform at once, so that in order to get a lady and a carring it became necessary for a couple of gentlemen to take possession of each side of the door and thrust her in vi et annul, as if indeed a violent assault were being perpetrated with the object of shooting event of the window on the far side of the carriage. Most of them took it all in good part, but when a goodly piece of flounce is torn off in the struggle, or a rent inflicted where it will he most conspicuous, of course then there is "a great least of languages. A viewed from the other side of the course, the prevailing colour in bonnets in the grand stand seems to be printed, and the cos things being chiefly dark, formed an appro prune, background 'The Hut itself was an awful ' and) burr)," but it moved about considerably in itself all over the corner in the turnout of the straight. About every tenth man had a gin case and a betting book, and, except for the costumed individuals near the rails, these shifted with the other nine As soon IIB a particular quarter showed signs of having "duffered out,' it became advisable to strike camp The jumping mee provided by far the most interest for this portion of the attendance, and as the chasers all came to the fences in front of the stand together, there would be a sudden, ruuineimuy silence When Sir Samuel fell heels over head, and smothered his jockey, those nearest barely made any SMII, and the rest immediately screwed round to follow the race One or two ran forward to pick up the rider and secure the horse, but whether either or both were killed or un- hurt ditto t matter to the others Next Saturday is Hospital Saturday. Perhaps these racegoers will not forget the hospitals for which the racing clubs and their patrons So frequently cater In one respect Caulfield possesses a convenience which Flemington does not Between the end of the flower pot stand, as it may be called, and that locality devoted to those who hunger and thirst after the purses of the sporting public, is a row of pines Here, my telling you, those who take their pie sure in getting up pound sweeps most do congregate There was quite a rush to the spot immediately after each race, the winners to get their money, and the losers to be in the next Most of those who under take getting up these little affairs are pretty well known, but occasionally the question may be heard, "Do you know this man and sometimes, when iiooneoftheBvveepsterB does, there is a sharp look out kept upon the innocent holder of the Loaney, who in all good faith strolls off perhaps visits the bar near the entrance gate, or mixes in the crowd in front of the stand, all unaware that he is being "shadowed,' and that his approach to the entrance gate t raised his shallower to draw up close for a for in case he should seek trees car outside with £18 or £20 in his pocket But such cases are chiefly reserved for Flemington, where the crowd is greater and the chance of being missed for a moment far less Some of these sweepsters too, sure philosophers pure and simple They dont care a button about the rain"', but, having invested their mine), plump down into one of the seats hereabouts, and calmly await the hoisting of the numbers It must be very different with others who have ventured small fortunes on their fancies 'lite lost 200 yards of the Cup race must have quickened the pulses of at least three individuals, unless they have been long past the proverbial stolidity of beau journey for instance, the sporting doctor, who is reported to have had £30 000 in the balance, must have watched Ben Bolt s final rush with something more than curiosity, and the silvermine people would scarcely have been less interested 11 -I the definition of what an art union must be would seem to be singularly elastic There is a project on foot in Melbourne just now, by which it is sought to dispose of a house and land several separate allotments of will, a buggy a piano, a sewing machine, a gold watch and chain, a tried de, and other works art, and the chief inducement for persons to purchase tickets is that, it they prefer it, the) can have the advertised value of the first live works of art-all house and allotments in cash Taking the list of prizes all through, the one which approaches nearest to a work of art is the piano, but you can t "et cash for that Of late years the time taken to turn out pianos with as much i spirits and as little regard to the demands of art as they have, displayed in the manufacture of washing boards a id mantles, and this prtiliulilj influenced the promoters m draw at, the line at the point they have met in houses and land come within the provision of section 5, it is., it may remain ably be asked what this is in this world which cannot be included The late Postmaster General to, alter That was, taken such li' lillie tur' lies and Co would have gone Chin off his head had it ever occurred to mar nun ' sweeps or consultations or uni or whatever they may be termed, could stirred just is stated under the Milk' in art unions as ever they did not re seem desolation In this case mine is not even the excuse of a en nimble object put forward and as the issue of tickets is apparently) unlimited, so far as information is afforded auntie true, and as amounts enunciates -iininiitees £700 in each for the first five prizes out in a total of the 100 prize in in an a I Intimai element Obsession in is imp rated
