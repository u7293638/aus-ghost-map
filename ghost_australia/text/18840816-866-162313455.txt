ELECTORAL REFORM IN ENGLAND. The debate in the House of Commons on the third reading of “ The Representation of the People Bill ” was characterised by the utter prostration of the Conservative Party. Like the Conservatives of. Tasmania the Censcrvaiivcs of England agreed Dial rlfHnral reform was nreeseary, and that the voting power of the people should be extended, but they wanted to extend the franchise iu their own particular way, and as they did not see how lliio could be uone without adopting sonic of the liars on which Mr. Gi.AUSToxK’.'Bill was framed, they made their principal objection against its in- completeness. The IhuaiE Atixisrr.u s speech on the occasion of the third reading was vigorous in tone, clear in argument, and thoroughly worthy of the great Liberal stutesmau who does not allow his personal comfort to ."'and in ihe way of his duty le his country. The future fate of the Bill had been indicated both inridc and outside of the House by important person*. One right honorable gentleman had said lliat the Bill had 44not the ghost of a chance." Mr. Or.iiiyrosE had no doubt that such members theught that that v.hich the Conservatives in the House had not been abW to attain, either Vy direct or indirect proreeding>, ought to be attained by the sheer force of a majority in the House oF L ords; and the on which the Bib was to be dealt in such a manner, ns to put an end to cxi»teDcr, was that it was incomplete. a-1they were only at the third reading on the 2d ill of .Tin;*’, whet, asked Mr. would hare been tlwir position iT they hr.d included in the Bill the difllcuh and complex matters connected with a redistribution of scaU." have united redistribution and the in the same measure,'’ said the Minister, "‘would have been a upon the House aud the country, we not only thought, but knew Parliamentary experience, that it nn impossibility." A pledge had given that a Bill for the redistribution of seats would be introduced next the assurance yras accepted by the aud the result of it was embodied the clause introduced by the member Wolverhampton (Mr. If. F owler), which fixed the dale for thccominencemcnt of the franchise. There was nothing left undone that could be done to avoid a quarrel, but instead of tins being ac­ knowledged there were threats. R e­ marking on ihe rumours that the Lords intended to reject the Franchise Bill. Mr. Gladstone said the principle which lmd actuated, and still actuated, the Government was expressed in the familiar lines of SjUKr-srEARi:— Bowav* Of ontrAiieo to a quam-l: but being in, Bom* it that the oppressor umy beware of Mr Gladstone by no means overlooked the serious nature of the ease. “ A conflict between the two Houses on such a question ns tin's/' said he, “ 1 take to be the. most serious prospect that has been opened during my recollection, since the crisis of the Cora Laws was opened to the view of Parliament.” And then he added, with marked and significant emphatU, “ What the ultimate issue of it will be I have not a doubt.” The speech of Sir Stafford Northcote, the leader of the Conservative party in the House, was remarkable, from the fact that it did not contain one objection to the Bill. The right lion, baronet spoke of the tliealriaal manner of Mr. Gladstone, and of the threats his words implied, and thee he went back to the only fault be had to find, namely, that the redistribution of scats was \ot coupled with the extensioa of Ihe franchise. He instanced the Conservative victories in tbo counties, with ft view to show that the itounly franchise, which was one of the main features of the Bill, did not interest the people iu the counties; but. as sub sequent speakers pointed out, the Conservative candidates had maintained the principles of the Bill, aud had declared they would support it: in fact, the country had looked upon the Bill as viitnally accepted. In marked contrast to the speech of Sir Stafford N ortjioote was that of Mr. Goschfk, who had opposed the Bill at every preceding stage, but who now withdrew his opposition : and as his remarks will give our readers a correct idea oT the importance of the sowing tftruggloiu England, we quote the following bm f extract irpti ibc xe^rib*of the debate, Mr. fefosouBK-.saiJ : -v He believed it would be. admitted l £ «>« Opposition that the eountry llio principle of Hie extension hf household suffrage to the counties as having been accepted, passed, and ratified, and as being beyond re fa ll-fc b e e rsl^n d jh a t ."hat-, ever fate might befall tins particular uiealuvo. or whatever fate might bofail the present Government,they hnciv tliht that priiicinle must be acknowledged, ra,d the country would expect any Govormupnt that came into office to support embodying that which was the.vital principle of this Hill. They uiust therefore a&novrledgo; in lire House, perhaps almost unanimously, that, subject U'to.yj'-ioetoon of time, the class to whom thm born held mil. irlmost.considered lha-t.hoj had now nrquired a right to the from 111. c. Under these ciwumstancoB, it seemed to him that theiime for any further opposition to the principle of the cxtum.ron of the franchise had passed awav, nud hi f.-lt that he himsalf had made his last speech against the principle involved, and that hencefoiih his duty as n member of that House would he to look to the question or redistribution, and to cn-operate in -nil efforts that might be made to ensur e a fair uud equitable distribution of political power among all the component the country, and belw “ * ’ " and now. (Cheers.) The third reading oE the Dili was carried iietniitc .'O'itoodl.Tiito, the Conservatives abandoning any further opposition. lYc all know Hie sequel. The UiH was rejected in the House oE Ijords, Parliament has been prorogued, and now the organisation of the combatting forces is being proceeded with rigorously, so that tbe feeling of the country nifty be thoroughly tested before tbc October session of Parliament is commenced, when the Bill will be reintroduced. The people of England may not regard the foreign policy of Mr Gi adstokk wilu favour,hut hie home policy has always been to raise tbe musses from their oppressed con­ dition, and there is little doubt tliat h< will in this instance achieve a signal vie lory, that his “ People's B ill” will soon become lew, and that 2,033,'WO of the working classes will soon have, the right to rote conferred upon them. And, considering the difference iu the habits, the educaiion, and the eirchiv stances generally of the poorer classes among the people of Ifngland, ihe Bill i h'lnueli greater advance in liberality than the Bill brought - into the Tasmanian House of Assembly by Mr. Ginti.v. 3 extends the household franchise and the lodgers franchise, which was previously given to the residents of boroughs only, to the same class of people liiroughoi ihe I'nilcd Kingdom, aud ii also cx'.end ihe fatiichisc to servauis.
