VICTORIAN CLUB MEETING. SATCRDAY, JANDABT 20. Stewards-Messrs. C. Brown, J. Grice, t>. D. O'Halloran, J. L. Purves, D. S. Wallace, F. C. Staudisb, A. F. Sullivan, and J. Wagner, Judge-Mr. J. Johnston. Starter -Mr. G. Watson. Handicapper-Mr. K T. Barnard. Secretary-Mr. T, Haydon. When the announcement was made that the English and Australian Elevens were to play their return match on the 20th January, the members of the Victorian Club were quite satisfied that their meeting would be con siderably interfered with. Nor did the weather help to improve the pros pects of the club, for it was dull and threatening throughout the day, aud pre vented many of the fair sex visiting Fleming ton. The hill presented a very bare appear ance, and a large number of the occupants of the stand were members and their friends, so that the club reaped no benefit by their attendance. The fiat also was sparsely attended, the whole of the visitors number ing not more than 4,000 persons. His Excel lency the Governor drove four-in-hand to the course, aud as be alighted Signor Zelman's tine band played the National Anthem, after which these accomplished instrumentalists performed some of the popular music in a manner which delighted the listeners. Although the attendance was limited, the racing was of a very high character, a better afternoons .Bport never having been wit nessed at Fiemington. A commencement was made with the Hurdle Race, the retirement of Danstan reducing the field to half a dozen, and as the Ballarat division put down their money with confidence the public followed suit, and Game left the paddock with odds of 5 to 4 on faim, the only other that received support being Rhesus, aud the selection was justified by the result, for Game had the race in hand at the turn, and won as he pleased, the only other near him being Rhesus. Speculation was pretty brisk over theTwo-year-old Stakes, which attracted a field of 16. Le Bean, a well-grown grey eon of Lecturer, brought excellent credentials from St. Albans, and he waB soon a better favonrite than anything else, though Ike, Lady Jer vois, Statesman, Monsoon, Agatha, The King's Son, Tichborne, Merry Fenella, and Caller On all met with a certain share of support. The race was ran at a rattling pace all the way, and as they neared the goal Le Beaa and Monsoon on the ex ueme right, and Ike aud Agatha on the extreme left, were almost level, but as the firstnamed pair finished under the judge's box many of the spectators did not observe them, and it was thought that Agatha had got borne a neck in front of the Terrara colt; but Le Bean under the Tails had beaten both by a short bead, and the aame distance separated second and third, and as Monsoon was alongside Le Beau she must have been only a head behind the three that were pluced. The winner was bred by Mr. H. C. White in New South Wales, which colony furnished the first three, for Ike and Agatha were also bred over the border. Le Beau was! | purchased by Mr. Branch at the Rand wick auction Bale for 75 guineas, and he will now no doubt regret that he did not nominate him for the V.R.C. Derby. Fryingpan, Eric tboneus, and Mistaken being the only absentees from the Victorian Club Cup, 15 numbere were hoiBted on the board. There was not much of a rash in the paddock to get a glimpse of the intending competitors, consequently there was no difficulty in inter* viewing them. Two of the fittest horses in the enclosure were Odd Trick and Baron von, Mueller, whose condition wab perfect. Gadarz created a very favourable impression, bat 68 Lotbair moved like a oat upon' hot bricks, he was friendless. This horse left Ballarat iu splendid form, bat on the Thare-i day before the race hie began to show signs of Borenese.'and moved so short and bad that he at once was sent to the right-about in the bet-! ting. Prometheus was not nearly fit, and another that was backward was Pollio. Corio Janus looked well enough pa the ere. bat nobody Beemed to fancy nim, albeit ruciours of a capital trial' had been indnstrioueljj circulated ; and Queen Mary*6 praises had been bo loudly Bang that her jproBpecti were regarded m second to none. The handsome little daughter of King of the King, was in rare form, and Mr. James ItedfearuY slashing fine colt The Planger created a very favourable impression, eq far as bis condition waa conoerned; that] in cpnBeqnepoe of the appearance of a stable boy in the s&ddleand; the preference shown by his friends for Oodarz and Qaeen ttaryj hfe was severely let alone. Little Jack, whd had evidently undergone a carsfol prepare! tion, was much fancied, tbe.victoryof Lei Beau in the Tnro-year-qld Stakes having increased, the confident* of bit partisans.

In the ringGudarp and Little Jack were, most in favour with backers, bat. Odd Trick,. Lesbi* ,WiUerod, and Qaeen Mary alio received agood deal <4 support, - The preliminaries havjngbeen in dulged in, there was a slight delay at the, pobt, daring which Coriol&nusl;&shed; out and < kicked Queen Mary. Contrary to expecta tion, Little Jack at once made1 play,1 anil sat oat the work at such a paoe that it was thought bp would settle his own «hanc& and BO hp aid, for be was done>ith fttiTmile anfl a nbartor.and then ensued a magnificent rade between Baron von Mueller.Odd Trick, Thle' Plunger, Willeroo, and Kathleen Mavdnrneeci. The.finish waseoolon thatmaoy thought 7t! was a ^ead heat between Odd Triok andlCae Plunger. bot the judge decided in faronr of. the latter, and placed Willeroo tUirajwi error which was subsequently rectified by Baron von Mueller's numbeiyTr tnted. The result was a tare thro» i 8ti' the ring, as the stable did not flne.

Abdaij ? too, met with some attention, The !!

The latter also was turned out in Mr. Howie's best style. Among (h. others, Wizard, Lord of Clyde, and Cassio peia were most fancied. A rattling pace wu made throughout, Transferred, Stationer aud Haidee of the Hills showing most pro! minently during the first portion of the journey, but at the distance Bassanio, Erie ihoneus, and Caeaiopeia were at the he&d; of affairs, and for a moment Cassiopeia looked like a winuer, but she died away ia the last few strides, and Bassanio, gamely answering Cracknel!'8 final call, won by half a head, this being the judge's verdict, Ericthoneus beingi neck in f ron t of Cassiopeia. This victory wu the moBt popular of the day, and general regret was expressed tbat Sir Thomas Elder was not present to see his colt win, for the pablic» cognise the fact that the worthy South Ms., trnliau races purely for sport HOBDLE BACK.
