THE COMING .COMET. (Saturday Review) Nervous people, as it is credibly stated, bave been put.togreat, aRtliety bythe an nouncementu, which recently appeared in the papers, that a distinguished astrono mer has discovered a monstrous comet rushing straight los ards us with amazing rapidity froam the remote abysses ofl pace, and yet liursaing its course wyitll as little tendency to'adeiiation as though it:were running upon rail,. Some friendly planat might by possibility put torth a helping hand, and twit.the approaching monster froma its course, as the hero. of a novel di verts the runaway steeud just as it is about to crush the heroine. Good-natured as tronomers have taken pains to explain that there is no such.comet comling; that, it it were comintg, it'wdild lie a very welcome visitor, and that we have already passed through a comet, and found it less ob noxious than a London log. The astrono mers mean Aivellj. but they arei terribly prosaic people. Tney ought surely to understand that they are robbing us of a lively pleasure. Have they not in their boyhood-for even astronomers have been bo3s--enatched a' tearful joy froum the ghosts and other supernatural dangers with which a childish i.) agination loves to people the dim burders of. its little world ? Would any ooe anillingly:givu up that de licious feeling' l suiperstitious awe which was at once the charm and terror of early years, and hase all phantoms suppressed till the world should be no mare haunted than ai railroad station'? Astronomers have already taken terrible liberties with the comet of our childhood. The fiery monster plunging through the sky with a death-dealing tail has been weighed and measured, andhad,..as it were,.a mathe matical hook put int its jaws, till his irn Iressiveness haoe departed froam him. We. know the legend of Cuvier's descent into the inlernal regions, antd of his declaration that the ,horns and hoots which terrified oar inlfancy kere untaistakable proolstof a gramminivorous nature. Even so the cornet has been lowered in popular esti mation till our skies have become as empty of horrors as -lyde Park ol tigers. Sir IW. Thompson, indeed, was kind enough last autumn to revirecoome of 'oa;u ancient elarmy, and to assure us that, seine time or other, the world could be smashl ed to atoms,.like a bursting shell,by a late as ioezorable a+ ihat whcich will bring about a collision at a metropolitan junc tion. Of course, his Ielliwr-philosophers found fault with soeine of his details, for science is a remorseless enemy to poetry. Let, us,- howesr, for a brief period " dally sait?i'lalde siermise;" and endeavour to leturn to the simple faith of a child. Let us imagine that the astronouii' has really prophesied our approaching fate, and that the prolheci isncorrect. W\ithin a few weeks we shall be able, without the helpl of telescopes, to see the little clood, no bigger than a mail's hand, and fraught with umene more dreadlul than have ever belore affriglt,-d the huatf?fi?ea.- "IT will grow, slow ly at first, but afterwards with a rate of increase almost perceptible to our naked visioa, till at loast the wholusky will be 'lit up with the fiery?portent.

But let us imagine that this difficulty, is our ouutued. If we were all really co?vinoc ihut lour o'clock p.m., Greenwich time, on the the next 12th oi Augusr, the whole human race and its dwelling-place wnuld be eutunurily knocked to atoms, what would be the effect upon our minds'? The tno-t untural suppnoition is perhaps that the whole course of affairs would be thrown out .o g-ar, and that we Ihould be reduced to the state of a city demturaulted by a plague. Persons pifstrong religious feeling would either go into retirement, or would endeovor to awaker the conecietices of'thd sinners around therln; whbil thie sinners would become utterly reckleis, and woul..roneiomber that -thero. rwatio use in ketpinig a cellar ;i wine to be con suwed by a comet.
