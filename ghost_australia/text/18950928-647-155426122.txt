OUR NEED. We need that baptism of the Holy Ghost in the fulness of its power for a hundred reasons. As far as I can tell, I believe that the people of the world were never more eager to listen to the Gospel of the divine righteousness and love than at this moment. And what we need is a great company of 'men in whom a divine fire is kindled, who, having seen for themselves the glory of God, shall be able to speak at first hand and on the strength of their own knowledge concerning His presence, His nearness to men, His power to bless and to redeem. We need the manifestation of the presence and power of the Holy Ghost among us that such may be given to us. The Church is dissatisfied with its wor ship, and some of the -people are actually dreaming that if we could only sing more cheerful tunes and sing oftener, something would be done. And some people are think ing that if we, the children of God, spoke to our Father in heaven out of a book, things would be better. Vain, misleading dreams ! What we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We cannot know God unless we have the life of God, and unless we know God we cannot worship Him ; and if the Spirit of God in the fulness of its power were ours, there would be triumph of faith, and there would be raptures of joy. â€” Dr. Dale .
