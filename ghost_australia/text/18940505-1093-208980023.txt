PIGGYS, VISITORS. There were six little crows so terribly thin, Their bones were coming right .through their .■■'skin, • And though ea'oh gobbled enough for threej They still were as thin as thin ooiild be ! ■> And there was a pig so dreadfully fat, That, panting and puffing, all day he sat; ; And. though he never ate dinner or tea, , He still was as fat as fat could be, • "Piggy, uear. piggy, what shall we do To.make ourselves, plumpeoy-plump like you? We find it is getting a serious matter ' To eat so muoh and hecnme no fatter." The pig gave vent to the ghost of a grin, "Be thankfill you're nothing but. bones and • skin; ... If I, my dears, were a good deal thinner, T. I shouldn't be killed for somebody's dinner."
