BLONDIN. BY PETJTKTSB.

Did you witness the tight-ropo exploits of that most famous of tight-ropie performers?

Did you see Blondin in his gunpowder glory on the tight rope O esteemed : that s what I want to know. But what do I want to know it for? Because, if you only saw Blondin, you saw next to nothing. We have had something more stupendous m the tight rope department to take away our breath and transfix us with surprise. Some six or sevfn weeks ago, the Right Rev. Dr. JAMES Moorhouse, Lord bishop of Melbourne, announced his intention to deliver a course of lectures in his pro-Cathe- 1 dral, Swanston-street, on THE PBINCIPIB OP THB APOCALYPSE. This intimation of his lordship's purpose attracted a succession of fashionable congregations every Wednesday afternoon during the month of August, and indeed public curiosity had been etimulated by the eocentrioity and Jiardihood supposed j j.- to v. be ._ involved .1—3 in an attempt """ -* on the part of one more Protestant mitre 1 wearer to open the seals and empty the vials and expound all over again the mysterious visions and voioes in the book of the prophecy of the Evangelist St. John. Science had been at work since former Protestant prelates had taken their seats on the oracular tripos. Neology had been spelling its way through the Revelations. Cloughs, and Straussen, and Bradlaughs had arisen. The old divinity fogies of King James the First's time had had their nightcaps pulled over their translating faces. The days of Adam Clarke were past. The Apocalypse had become easier, less obscure, and Dr. Moorhouse was just the man to take the trumpet out of the archangel's hand, and step onto the tight-rope, and sound a new reveille as interpretive bugler vice Elliott and Cumming, long since gone down to Hades, All Melbourne, therefore, and his wife and his grown-up daughters ran to hear how their bishop would tune up the old King James built instrument to the pitch and tone required by the new taste of the new school of Protestant revised New Testament music masters. His lordship has just conoluded j his performance, and all the papers e a y ! that not even the great Blondin^ he had ! been a Protestant bishop, oould have tripped ; and skipped acress the interpretive tightrope with greater aplomb, fearlessness, and' flourish than did my lord of Melbourne in his Wednesday exhibitions. The episcopal apron was a little in the way at first; but his lordship soon got over that, a n d finished with a Mmnerset into the^^ cowl I of Exeter Hall, which his audience rewarded with ' enthusiastic - - . - There was a strange feeling of perplexity at the commencement of Dr. Moorhouse's discourses, occasioned by an entirely new and alarming discrepance between his lordship's opinion and the opinion of a Right Reverend brother, formerly Bishop of Bristol, concerning the mystical identity of the wellknown and very wicked SCARLET WOMAN of the Apocalypse, who chose as her favourite sofa the back of a blood-stained " Beast" which had stretched himself at his full lubber length on " Seven Hills" as an easy couch. Dr. Moorhouse scornfully repudiated Dr. Thomas Newton's notion, and declared that his Right Rev. brother's interpretation of the wicked Scarlet Madam and the blood-stained Beast violated the fundamental canon of Scriptural interpretation, turned the prophecies into a mash of irrelevant gabble, and made void the mission of the Holy Ghost. In short, Dr. Moorhouse plainly told his people, on the last five Wednesdays, that it vfas an outrage on Reason, and the stultification of Revelation, to say that the "Deast" -in the Apocalypse, or that the wicked Scarlet " Woman" seated on the Beast's loins, typifies the Church of Rome. For the whole - five weeks of August, 1833, has Dr. Moorhouse been fighting bravely qgainet this false, anti-eoriptural, Protestant monster myth.. The battle between the good St. George and the Dragon waa,only child's play oompared with the bold struggle of Dr. Moprh'ouse against the Scarlet Womftja^ and the Beast. But the valiant bishop ^on. The fabulous panther and his rider are slain, and you and I, 0 .esteemed reader, will thankfully hope that tbe:gupreme Head of hia Ohuroli^'WiU canonize the heroio bishop ' feir his oti^fliy la fro® 3hs infamy of being the Beast and the Scarlet Woman. I do not say that Dr. Moorhouse slew the Beast and the Scarlet Woman out of pure love of me or of youeither, O esteemed reader. In fact, I believe his lordBhip only relieved ns from one dishonour to plunge us into a deeper degradation. But still, he has said it in his pro- Cathedral that the long-cherished interpretation so dear to Protestant souls, is s"ti'-"i>ive of all sound scripture criticism, and uiierly perverts the inspired and written Word of God. It was time, then, for the hoary Protestant fiction to perish; and as it had been fabricated by one Protestant bishop, it was a righteous retribution that another Protestant bishop should be its hangman. We have had our St. George and < he Dragon; now we have a St. Jamei and the Scarlet Beast. WOESE THAN SOABLET. Never, 0 esteemed reader, never be thrown off your guard by the kindness of a Protesantegonist, even though o° \- L T o ^ u r t n k- ° Protestant ever concede you anything N jury than without that which resolving he professes to do ^ you a * to worse be ~ B 0 ' J f o r a n d a s h a m e d o f > P Y o l l m i g h t i n ur innocence have thought that whin Dr. Moorhouse retracted and cancelled the disraceful charge against you of being nothing t h a l l „ B T* h e B e a a t* a n d ; the Drunken W o m 8 n o ( t h e Apocalypse/when he had 8 0 g e n e r o u s l y W 1 1 8h e d ''th^ mark of the B e f l> off your Papist brow, that he would l e a v e y o u at o n e a l& y o n a c b a n o e o { regaining your good name generally for the r ef t o f / 0 U J r l i f e B W e U i f * o n t h/ u g h t B 0, y o u w e r e a 0 e 8 t e e m ed reader; and so j t o I d y o u f° u r o r five a g 0.

It is a complete distortion of the Divine word to say so, and Dr. Moorhouse will not suffer anyone to distort it. What, then, mill he allow every one to say of this early, and mediaeval, the Church of whioh the Popes -were supreme pastorB ? HiB Lordship had drawn a most frightful pioture of the fraudfulness and lawlessness, and the unnameable abominations, the obscene habits, the cruel customs, the perfidious character, the nature worship and demon worship, of pagan Roman Empire under the Emperor Nero. That pagan empire will ere long be destroyed. But, says Dr. Moorhouse, (EXTBAOT.) " they"—that is, the cruelties, the fraudB, the lawlessness—" were very far indeed from perishing Pluming in the tne fall rail of or the me pagan empire, empire. mft - w : m w & f enthusiast. The Apooalypse, says Dr. Smith, either findB a man oraoked or it leaves him so. Dr. Moorhonse quoted this "flippanoy of Smith" in his fint lecture. In whioh category thinkeftt thou, 0 esteemed reader, is his lordship seeking to be classed, when he does not hesitate to empty out suoh a basin of foul and perilous stuff in a pro-oathedral P No «u in the world oan have any objeotion to Dr. Moorhouse attitudinising on the Apocalyptical tight rope; but what shall anyone say for his refined taste when he takes up a Chinee ttinkpot and with it fumigates the welkin? That "Extract" I ham given from his concluding lecture is a most discreditable bunch of historic falsification, sneering jibes, and slanderous insinuations. Its history, in so far as it purports to be in any way historical, is simply a string of historic fallacies. The speaker of them could not have ever oared to form a sober judgment upon the matters which only a very slight share of official dignity might have withheld him from alluding to so eooffingly in tbe pulpit. I do not know whether good taste is always conferred with the velvet cap and soarlet and velvet gown of an Oxford DID. That, however, is his affair: and whether the two things go together or not, he is) now defied to substantiate, from solid and respeotable sources, the ooatse and vulgar misapprehensions whioh he has expressed in the extraot given above.
