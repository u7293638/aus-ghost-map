WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS! YOUNG. By Hbniiy Lapiiak. When I was young ! Ah, woful whon ! Ah, for tho change 'twixt now and then ! This breathing houses ml built with hniids, This body that does me griovous wrong, O'or airy cliffs and glittering sands How lightly then it flashod along. Liko thoso trim skiffs, unknown of yoro, Un winding lakOB and rivers wido, That ask no aid of sail or oar, That fear no spito of wind or tide Nought enrod this body for wind or weather When Youth and I livod in it togothor. Thoughts liko these, less beautifully, framed, we inudt all sometimes have uttered, either to ourselves or that alter ego,a trust worthy familiar friend. Never are we more conscious of the flight of youth than at the seasons when the circling year brings round, the universal holiday of Christmas time. Where are now the buoyant spirits and the eager longing with which we anticipated the coming holiday, as- if wo had never before enjoyed a Christmastido, and never should share one again ? Eheu, fugaces, they, are fled ! and never till we ate born again in that now life beyond the grave shall we renew ' the times when wo re ineinDer to nave oeen joyiui ana tree from blauie.' Christmas means to us now noth-. ing better than sad memories, indigestion, and unpaid bills. Do you not gaze in en vious wonder at the healthy, hearty, vora cious, omnivorous youngsters who can calmly devour roast beef and turkey, plum pudding and mince pies, without one thought of impending evil — whose only dread is that all the pudding will bo eaten, and none remain for frying to-iuorrow ? Who, after enjoying fairyland in the trans formation scone, falling madly in love (for half an hour) with those smirking.raddlod, scandalously attirod females whom ho thinks are fairy queons, and laughing till his sides are sore at the stale jests of Har lequin and Pantaloon, can, when he comes home, surreptitiously secrete two! mince pies in his trouser-pockcts, devour them ere he retires to his pillow, and then sleep tho sound, placid sloop of a tirod boy till long after the cock-crow next morning ? What would we not give to possess his vitality, his elastic spirits, his joyousness and freedom from care ! And we, alas ! sit in our chamber watching tho ghosts of the 11O of. ?f.l»ni*\V\ enriiir 111? ''Will nl-tl Ii^irlrlln nn-n.1 j jyivau ui-wjy ?jiiv^ij wji J-UMjUUI l-UlU.VJ.J.U'ilJiUw, | father, see beside you that dear, loving ' form, whose kiss upon your forehead was ( always your best Christmas gift, whose gentle voice was your sweetest Christmas greeting-. You hear tho rustle of her dross ; tho perfume of her presence you seem to know. You lift your head to great Alcestis, and see the shadow, smiling wist- , fully, eludo your eager arms, and all that remains is the memory of vanished love and a low grassy mound in a graveyard far away. You, oh mother, sitting alone to night, you dream and dream till again the , manly voice which was always kind is sounding in your oar ; the strong hand, so long your stay, is pressing yours again j and onco again your tired headrests on the broad shoulder till some trivial sounds dispel tho dream, and tho hard realities of life and desolation are your Christmas gifts. And the absent — how shall wo dream of them ? Let us not dreain at all The dead are safe ; they cannot change nor disappoint us.
