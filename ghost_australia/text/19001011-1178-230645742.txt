BANNEBMAN ON CHAMBERLAIN. The converse of the alleged legal maxim as to when: it is absolutely necessary to "abuse the other side" is being illustrated Just now in British politics. The. Liberals have not even the ghost of a chance of being success ful in that case which has been submitted to the Judgment of the British electors. The' leader of the 'party,' Sir ' H. Camp- beU-Bannerman, Is apparently not find ing his temper grow sweater as the prospect of utter defeat becomes more certain. If.ls nbt.every man, however, who in a fit of a'nger-''unpaoks\hlB heart with words," who can manage vto be witty as- well as bitter in his, comments. Yet no less a feat has been achieved by Sir Henry, His description of Mr. Chamberlain as "a pushing bagman" is really one of the neat est and most caustic things which have been said for many a day. There is Just enough truth in it to season its malice, and to ren der both delightful to folk who take a cyni cal pleasure in seeing those who rlde the high horse in connection with great affatrs occa sionally taken down. Not, Indeed, that it can be hinted for a moment that Mr. Chamberlain has not been a- most plucky rider of a very unmanageable steed, and that he thoroughly deserves the success which he has achieved. Be this as It may, that phrase of the "pushing bagman", will he apt to stick.
