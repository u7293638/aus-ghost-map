Though honor fair belongs to Fred. J. Osmond, who wa beaten for the Mile Championship, he is simply irrepressible In handicaps. At the Early Cloning Fete, 011 9th June, at the Crystal Palace (gravel-cinder path, Si laps to the mile), the official handi- capper (the present writer) let tbe starts out nil round— average 130 yard a ; yet, with numbers of good men trying, be won the final heat from scratch by 40 yards— track nearly flooded. On the following Saturday, 16tU June, at the Private Banks Sports, & heavy turf track, I let the etarts out enormously, the ordinary scratch men having from CO to 100 yards and the average start was 170 yards, several radug men had over 200 and up to 250. My kind friends the critics voted the handicap a pre- liosterous. one aud declared Iismona had not a ghost of a chance; but after the finest hie uf handicap riding ever seen iu any cycle race he iust got up and won by a length (ram D. M'Ka, 100 yards (who is v«-ry often on scratch). Ouo man in the final had 230 another 250 yards. Amateurs (?) on the At the Kildare sport (Loudou)last Saturday one of the roott diagracefal "ramps" ever per petrated took place. In the final heat of tho One Slile Blotch; Handicap there w«-rc five Ktartere. It was whispered about that a »lant" had been arranged by four cf the men, and that there was only one honest rider in the crowd. So it proved. Two of the riders, Beruhard by name, nave for some time devoted thvlr attention to winning their heats, and betting heavily thereon. There is a third brother, and he, on this occasion was working with a bookmaker (who, in the end, happilv swindled the gang). Anyhow, they worked it. The leastguiltyof thelot, Murray— a lad who has hitherto been free from a taint of sus picion, was selected to win, and was nursed by the three others— anyone of wlimn could have beaten hiin— who continued to shut out the only dangerous man — Attfield. The scandal was common talk in sporting circles, and a statement of thc case was laid before tbe Executive of the National Cyclists' Union ou the Tuesday evening — ouly three days after wards. They expressed their opinion with great firmness, and suspended the three brothers Beruhard (including the bookruakiug one, who also races), Murray, the winner, and the last man Gough. Universal satisfaction is cx- S reused at tbe result of the prompt action of the '.GU. Oue of tlie offenders promptly got the 44 sick " from the office in which he was engaged. Omnium Gatherum.
