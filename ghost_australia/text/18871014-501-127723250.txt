U. S. Law Against Blasphemy. A MAN named Reynolds, who was defended by Colonel Bob Ingersoll. has just been fined £5 and JE15 costs in New jersey for blasphemy under tho statute of 16G4 against blasphemy. This is tho statute -'If any person should wilfully blaspheme tho holy name of God by denying, cursins, or contumaciously reproaching His being , or Providence, or by cursing or contum aciously reproaching Jesus Christ, or the ' Holy Ghost, or the Christian religion, or ? ?the Holy Word of God— that is, the books of the Old and New Testaments — or by profane, scoffing at or exposing them, or any of them, to contempt and ridicule, then every person so offending shall, on conviction thereof be punished by a fine not exceeding £40, or imprisonment at hard labor not exceeding twelve months or both.' The, Judge said that although the statute did originate in colonial days, it was re enacted in 1844. and allowed to remain when the statutes were revised in 1874, and even since the indictment the Legisla ture had met, and there was not even a suggestion to repeal it.
