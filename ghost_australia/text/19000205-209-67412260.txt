FENCINO EXTRAORDINARY. A NOVEL EXPERIENCE. Mr R. Matheson arrived from the city by the afternoon train on Thurs day last andwas met'at 'thet station by his son in charge of a horse and vehicle. Nothing untoward happened until opposite Mr .M'Namara's resi. denor, when the animal used his per suasive powers as to who was " boss of the track.": He eignalled his intention by putting his hind hoofs through the splashboard in no uncertain manner, and harked the shins of the Messrs Matheson so palpably that they yet imagine they were engaged in a Corn. ish wrestling tournament, Not setis fied with this performance the on prinoipled steed started on a mad career for the cemetery, but the driver thought it safer to run him at the fence on the lower side of the 'road. A two-railer proved a mere shadowy obstaole to the frightened brute, which he negotiated in great style, in addi tion to carrying the fore portion of the trap with him. The hack wheels took the fence away, and Matheson, junr., was landed in Mr J. J. Linton's pad dock, reins and all. The Arab steed, with Mr Matheson and his son's'newly made wife behind him, was ultimately checked through applying a special break of his own invention-or, in other words, safely ascuring his leg between the axle and crosabar. The buggy was so dismantled as to be beyond repair. Mr Matheson also underwent a unique experience two weeka prior to the sabove escapde. After driving his son with his bride to the Tinamha rail way station, when reaching Manuon's bridge he drove to the river to water his favorite buggy mare. She partook of the crystal waters of the, Macaliuter, uttered three piercing ahriek,, and forthwith gave up the ghost. Mr Matheson now intends to trust-sopely to " shaitka' mare."
