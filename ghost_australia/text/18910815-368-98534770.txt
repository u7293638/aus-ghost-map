FRIDAY'S POLICE COURT. BEFORE the Police-Magistrate and Mr. S. Meyer. ALLOWING ANIMALS TO STRAY. The following persons were fined in the amounts stated for allowing horses and cattle to stray in the public streets:â€”George Lansdown, 2s 6d with 5s 8d costs; James Simons, 5s with 5s 8d costs; William Nash, 2s 6d with 2s 6d costs; James Marshall, 2s 6d with 5s 8d costs. A similar case was preferred against R. T. Ball for allowing a cow to stray, but the defen dant did not appear. Constable Beezley proved the service of sum mons and deposed that defendant had told him it was a pity the police hadn't something else to do than to impound people's cattle. Senior-constable Williams deposed he found the cow on the 31st July last in Belmore Park at about 6 p.m. among the flower beds, and he took it to the pound. J. Sibson, acting poundkeeper, also gave evi dence. The Police-Magistrate, on being informed that the defendant was really the Mayor of Goulburn, expressed some considerable surprise. He thought it a very strange thing that the head of the municipal body should be guilty of in fringing the law in this respect, when only some little time ago the Council had particularly re quested the police to help them to put down the cattle-straying nuisance. The defendant was convicted and fined 2s 6d with 5s 8d costs. UNSOUND MIND. Bridget Elizabeth Donnelly was brought up and charged with being of unsound mind. Drs. Morton and Handcock-Burkitt gave medical testimony to the effect that the patient's mind was deranged, and she was unable to take sare of herself; she was of a morose disposition and fancied she saw ghosts. The Bench ordered her removal to the Glades ville Asylum. OBSCENE LANGUAGE. Charles Cole, summoned for making use of obscene language, did not appear. The information was laid by John Silvan, cook at the police barracks. A warrant was ordered to be issued for the arrest of Cole.
