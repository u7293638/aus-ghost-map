NOVELIST, The Van Rensselaer Ghost. ItY ItLiEN V. TALOOT. It was with onti:ipations of plenanio that my friend, Ituport Davieon complied with youon Winter's invitation to spend Now Year's aat his country seat. Winter had but lately been msrried, and was indulging a whim for opending the holidnay in the eountry, at an old manueon ito bad lately purchaed on the Sound. Tihe novelty of the thing war, in ieesll, agreeablo, and there was suro to be molutrs whoos reading alone was rnough to titillato the palate; and though ltupost was by no means a gourmand, he was Dio more indilfferent to tio charms of quail on toast and devilled lobster than aol. other man, irda, Winter was a protty woman, and a delightful hostess, and, in Phort, smy friend felt suro that his visit would prove one of ths moot delightful incidents of the'anowbound reeRon. It was, therefore, with a blithe lheart that he stopped from the., usear upon the Aster station, lind inquired the way to Mr. Charles Wioter's hoour, It's a good three miles from here," said a man in an old army overcoat. "You'd better step into my aleigh, and I'll take you out for a quarter; seoam staougo they didn't meet you, if you were expected," lie added, with thie free curiosity peculiar to men at his elas .in Now -Nngland. "Perhaps they didn't know your train," continued hebo couehmar, when ltupert and hie portmanteau wer eonto in the sleigh. "It may bh you that sent thin telegram I amt taking to them \- now. It ame a couple of hours ago, but the station master, seeing no one was dead, and the roads so bad, thought he would wait awhilo until come one was going that way." Rlupert could not avoid smiling, but his thoughts were diverted by the wide expenca of snowy flolds through whic thry waoreo iu. sing ; the villnage lay to the rijght, and in tbis direction was here anod there only a lonely farmohcno tiurroended by its unlpinted autbuildinge, and loaded with a weight of enow ' ij ii ....." ,'iost to hurv_ itL o T, y ... r I uA n" .n ,"g '.;" ?'1s"t 7' .in 6 c'.- "'O wuaych al.m, ,t ?.
