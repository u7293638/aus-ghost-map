THE CASE OF THE ANO EL HOTEL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,-Knowing you are a staunch advocate for fair play and justice, I beg to draw the attention of the public to the case of the Angel Hotel, in a sub- leader you have been pleased to publish, in strong terms casting an uncalled- for doubt on the authenticity of my statement. The facts are as follow am-The girls in question came into my house in a drunken state, and observing such, I in Btructed ray barman to get them out-which he did, asking them to the rear of the pro- mises, which leads to a public right-of-way, one of whom must have gone to an open shed, half of the right-of-way. I most emphatically deny their having had any drink in my house, which I can prove by respectable tradesmen who were in the house at the time. Now, Sir, as for your aspersion on the character of the house, I am bound to say that since I took possession of it I maintained a rigid and strict adherence to the law, and that, taking into account the locality and frequenters of that neighbourhood, I challenge oven Scott's Hotel for being better conducted and when I cannot do so with a proporTcgard to public morality and decency, I will abandon the place. Trusting you will insert this letter in the nnlnmriH of your Journal. by doing so you will oblige -Yours, &c;"""W.ÉLlAM°EVAÑS. " I Angel Hotel, Bourke-street east.
