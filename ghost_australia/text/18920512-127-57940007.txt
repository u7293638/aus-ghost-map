dA INTERESTING HALF-HOUR FOR BOYS AND GIRLS READING OUR YOUNG FOLKS' LETTEA I, reEM BEr. December's here, and with her brought A world in whitest marble wrought; The trees and fence and all the posts Stand motionless and white as ghosts, And all the paths we used to know Are hidden in the drifts of snow. December brings the longest night And cheats the day of half its light. No bird-song breaks the perfect hush; No meadow-brook with liquid gush Rims telling tales in babbling rhyme Of liberty and suimner time, But frozen in its icy cell Awaits the sun to break the spell. Breathe once upon the window-glass And see the muiic mists that pass, Fantastic shapes that go and come Forever silvery and dumb. December Santa Claus shall bring, Of happy children, happy king. Who with his sleigh and rein-deer stops At all good people's chimney- tops. Then let the holly red be hung, And sweetest carols all be sung, While we with joy remember them, The j'urneyers to Bethlehem, Who followed trusting from afar The guidance of that happy star Which marked the spot where Christ was born Long years ago one Christmas morn! -St. icholasz.
