Captain Webb reports having left Newcastle, N.S.W., on the 18th ult., with strong N.W. breeze, which increased as he entered the Straits. On the 6th inst., when off Cape Otway, during the fearful gale which prevailed she was struck by a heavy sea, which washed the binnacle overboard, started the covering-boards, stanchions, and bulwarks, and did other damage ; she also split close-reefed main-topsail and topmast staysail. On the following day, the gale still continuing, and the vessel labouring heavily, he was obliged to throw overboard a portion of cargo. Then bore up for Port Philip Heads, which she reached at four p.m., arriving in the bay the same night. THE schooners Willing Lass, from Warrnambool, and the Yarra, from Circular Head, which arrived in Hob- son's Bay on Tuesday evening, are both bound to Adelaide, and were obliged to bear up for this port owing to stress of weather. Both vessels have sus- tained considerable damage. THE brig Venture, from Newcastle, has been obliged to throw a portion of her cargo overboard. She has also lost several sails. CAPTAIN J. R. BENNET of the Hamlet's Ghost, re- ports the following whalers :—The Bonnie Doon, Cap- tain Wybrow, was at the Chesterfield Group, in a leaky condition, the lower chainplate bolts having started. She was making so much water, and had en- countered such bad weather, that Captain Wybrow put in to those islands for shelter, and intends to fish on that station during the remainder of the season. He had forty-five barrels of oil on board. On the 10th June Captain Bennet parted company with the barque Offley, of Hobart Town, Robinson, master, six weeks out, and all well. On that date also he boarded the Victoria, of Hobart Town, Ornistalk, master, about fifty miles to the E.S.E or Cato's Bank. She was six weeks out, and was " clean." The Victoria had spoken the Fury and Cærnarvon, both clean, and the Am- herst, Lee, master, with forty-five barrels oil.—Bris- bane Courier, July 1. TESTING GROUND TACKLE.—The necessity for a com- pulsory test of anchors and chain cables for merchant ships may be taken to be generally admitted, though the difficulty in the way of effecting this amendment has hitherto, no doubt, prevented its accomplishment. That difficulty does not so much consist in providing the means of testing ground tackle, as in fixing upon the proper parties whose business it shall be to effect the test. We have always contended, and we think on reasonable grounds, that the responsibility in this matter should not be cast upon the shipowner. He is simply a purchaser, and the quality of the articles he purchases depends not on him, but on the manu- facturer who supplies them. The public convenience, and occasionally the public safety, demands that the responsibility in this respect should be thrown upon the manufacturer, and the extension of this principle to the manufacture of ground tackle would be a salutary arrangement, and would settle a long-disputed question. We do not see why the Board of Trade should not be authorized so license testing establishments, to which the manu- facturer should be compelled to send ground tackle before it is offered for sale. The chains and anchors to tested would then have affixed to them an author- ised proof mark, which would be the security to the purchaser that he had an article on which he could place reliance, and to the public generally that the most important portion of a ship's appointments is of good and proved material. Such a law would in- flict no injustice upon the manufacturer, because he is bound, as an honest man, to supply the best article for the price, while it would protect the shipowner from unfair dealing, or even prevent him, if so disposed, from risking his property by procuring inferior ground tackle. We do not say that if the responsibility of testing was cast upon the manufacturer in the first instance, it would not be proper to direct the Customs authorities to refuse a clearance to any vessel not provided with pro- rerly-tested anchors and cables. We only contend that the testing of such articles is no business of the ship owner, and that he must not be held responsible for the performance of a duty which properly attaches to another. There is no doubt, however, that the safety of navigation requires that some arrangement should be made for the efficient testing of ground tackle. Bad anchors and chains of deficient holding power are amongst the most fruitful sources of disaster at sea. There are in our leading ports, it is true, testing-houses in practical operation, and the matter of testing chains and anchors has been re- cently taken up by Lloyd's Register Committee in a manner which promises satisfactory results. But to render the testing process universal, it must be made compulsory, and the sooner this is done—provided it be done considerately and wisely—the better for the interests of navigation. Once the principle of com- polsory testing is fairly admitted, the rest is mere matter of detail. We do not anticipate any opposi- tion in Parliament to a proposal for effecting an arrangement of admitted necessity, and against which, we believe, no substantial objection can be urged.—Mitchell's Maritime Register.
