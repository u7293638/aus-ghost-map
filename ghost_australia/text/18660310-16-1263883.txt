THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES. By CHARLES LAMB. I HAVE had playmates, I have had companions In my days of childhood, in my joyful school days ; All, all are gone,' the old familiar faces., I have been laughing," I have been carousing! Drinking late, sitting late with my bosom cronies : all all are gone, the old familiar faces. I loved a love once, fairest among women ; Closed are her doors on me, I must not see her All all are gone, the old familiar faces.' j - I had a kind friend, a kinder friend has no more ; like on ingrate, I left my friend abruptly ; Left him, to muse on the old familiar faces. Ghost-like, I paced round the haunts of my childhood, ' ' Earth seem'd a desert I was bound to traverse, Seeking to find the old familiar faces. Friend of my bosom, their more than a brother, Why wert thou not born in my father's dwell- ing ? So might we talk of the old familiar faces. Bow some they have died, and some they have left me, And some are taken from me e, all are departed ; All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.
