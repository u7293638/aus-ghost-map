Fairfield's Election. (Written for the Queenslander Christmas Supplement.) BY W. SENIOR. THE Fairfields of Faverton Hall were rightly called an old family, for it seemed as certain as such things can be that they came over long before the Norman free- hooters established their right to teach the conquered Englishmen their delightful Uttle arts of civilisation. Tet they were unfortunate in many respects; they were a living illustration of the notorious unfit ness of things in this unstable world. It is sometimes said that to them that have much wUI be given; but it is said in senses far other than that intended by the original saying. And such is lUfe, indeed! Poor but honest Tom Styles, in travelling through the thorny brakes of this world, will meet with scant hospitaUty or gifts of kindness, while rich but rascaUy Be Busti bus wiU find open doors everywhere and treasures poured into his hands in lavish abundance. That is one reading of the wise saw. The Fairfields of Faverton HaU experi enced another reading. They had—as the worthy Colonel, at the time which we are gradually approaching, was never weary of reminding his family—"blood, sir, and blood of the best." They had, too, what is not always associated with blood— brains; that is to say, brains of a certain kind. But they had no money, and they Uved in a county, or it would be moro strict to say in the corner of a county, where the pretensions of blood not only did not count but were ridiculed. The Manchester men were not at all impressed with the fact that there was no bluer blood in England than that which was deposited in Fairfield veins. They could see that it did not assist the Faverton Hall people in making bank balances, and that it did not enable them to turn their hereditary ad vantages to account in the praotioal ledger of life. Some of the neighbors of Colonel Fairfield did not hesitate to flout the pretension altogether. They argued, as shrewd but horridly unromantic men will argue, when they choose to bo disagreeable, that acres and cash-in-hand and bricks and mortar are their own witnesses. No man oan gainsay them. Ancient lineage and blue blood, on the other hand, they insisted was a mere idea, and would remain so until the most secret history of every family could be verified; in which case, they went on to say, some astonishing trans positions amongst men and things would take place. Thus arguing, they thought neither better nor worse of the Fairfields, for ail their asserted Saxon origin; but treated the tall white-moustachioed Colonel as they would treat any other man of their acquaintance who was compelled to keep up substantial appearances of gentility upon very shadowy means. The reader will doubtless wonder why the Fairfields, whoso annals occupy a pro minent chapter in the history of tho county families of Great Britain, should have pitched their tent in so uncongenial a place as the manufacturing districts of Lanca shire. That was a question which often presented itself to the younger members of the Fairfield family, who, to the conserva tive Colonel's sorrow, developed ideas to which he and his ancestors had ever been strangers, as if mere contact with the soil influenced the heart and mind, and effected in them tho transformation which the smoky chimneys of the surrounding fac tories exercised upon the outer face of nature. The explanation of this apparent incon gruity must be sought for in the conserva tive charaoter of the Colonel himself. He might have sold Faverton Hall twenty times over for a sum which, in his strait ened circumstances, would have been a fortune; but the temptation, though fre quently placed tangibly and pressingly before him, was never listened to for a moment. Through all tho Royalist wars of the Stuart period tho old Elizabethan mansion had stood staunch to tho failing cause, and there were legends quaint and tragic attached to each wing and room of the building. The Colonel, therefore, pre ferred poverty and pride to independence and the abandonment of the hall of his forefathers. He had lived to see the green pastures covered with factories and chemi cal works which stunted the trees, blasted the vegetation, and deprived the district of its sweet rural character. Year after year he had become soured at the new era and its strange manifestations. He had seen dirty little factory boys grow up to become merchant princes ; his own gardener's son sat by his side at petty sessions ; the sons and daughters of illiterate spinners in the floodtide of their prosperity would treat the Fairfields of Faverton HaU, if not with contempt, certainly with a toleration and air of patronage they did not attempt to conceal. Under these circumstances the gallant Colonel in his retired lifo, as I havo said, became gloomy and taciturn, and his children, who had become infected with the more modern notions of progress, grew up discontented, and secretly repined at the obstinacy of their proud parent. Our more immediate concern, however, is with Seymour Fairfield, the Colonel's eldest son. He had been educated at Rugby and Cambridge, had eaten his way in orthodox fashion to the bar, and had, at the timo he is introduced on our stage, never held a brief or earned a guinea. He had, it must be confessed, no love for his profession ; but tho Colonel had always be come too wroth at his proposals to try his fortune on the Exchange, or in the princely warehouses of the County Palatine, to per mit him, without an express act of dis obedience, to carry his wishes into effect. The young man inwardly chafed at his do nothing and aimless existence, and wan dered about the echoing lobbies, and en closed grounds of Faverton, indulging in few pleasures but tho pleasures of melan choly. On an ominonco not moro than a milo from the Hall stood a spick-and- span new house —a huge solid hybrid piece of archi tecture that seemed from every one of its many windows to tell the world at largo that it represented wealth, and was proud of it. Great, verily, was the contrast be tween it and Faverton Hall, which had a mourning cloak of ivy over its shoulders, and shut itself jealously within its big iron gates and oak paling, as if it invited seclu sion, and desired nothing better than to bo encircled with the ancestral trees which lived on amidst conditions of atmosphere hard to contend against. This spick-and span " eligible country residence was the home of a spick-atm- span new owner, a worthy man in his way, passably sound in mind and heart, but a little spoiled by the good fortune which he had won for himself. But wo wiU let Mr. Peter Dawson pass without much ceremony. We havo little concern with him at present. The rich self made man had a daughter, and it is the daughter who shall now be introduced. Rose Dawson at your good service: a taU fair haired girl, dashing in manners, sprightly in speech; given, when she chose, to speak with eyes, hands, and shoulders as well as with her red lips; clever in a variety of ways; well supplied with the small change of social coin, and imperious and happy as young ladies will be who are surrounded with luxury, and who drink in with their mother's milk the creed that Money is Power. We may save time and trouble by stat ing at once that this young lady had not a little to do with Seymour Fairfield's melancholy. As the saying goes, ho was madly "in love " with her. She was "in love' with him also, after a fashion, but herein lay the cause of tho youth's lacka daisical wanderings and musings. Rose Dawson's affection was not concealed by her. If the testimony of Master Shak speare is worth a groat, maidens used to keep secret their hearts' affairs, and let concealment eat into their damask cheeks like a worm i'th' bud. But this was in days when thero wero no highly-spiced novels to sour and embitter tho springs of sweet maidenly reserve, and when thero often did occur touching romances in real life, the like of which we shall see no more for ever. Roso Dawson was a fair flower to behold; but there was that about its bloom which told the careful observer that it was after all tho production of a forcing house; and perhaps this was why Mr. Seymour Fairfield and Rose Dawson had come to an understanding without any mystery, palpitation, loss of appetite, sleep lessness, quarrels, jealousies, and the like. This was no doubt why the youth, loving the maid heart and soul, found something wanting in the affection which he had often been assured was returned by her. There was an aching void, as tho hymnist puts it, apropos of quite another business, and thus the singular result ensued that what in most young men inspires the will, warms tho blood, tingles the pulse and makes the dullest eye sparkle with delight, con verted this briefless blue-blooded young barrister into an amateur Melancholy Jacques. ' I can bear this no longer, Rosey. To morrow I will sco your father, ana learn Onco for all what the end of this is to be' So, sauntering up Faverton Clough, did young Fairfield of that ilk make known his thoughts to Roso Dawson. The Lan cashire doughs—we should call them guUies in the antipodes—arc almost all that is left of beautiful nature in the strictly manufacturing districts, and so it often happens that where trocs are stunted and grass browned by poisonous chemical blights, essential to successful manufac ture, there may be found charming little glens, where tno children make holiday amongst the wild flowers, and lovers possess treasured nooks, decked in the spring with wild hyacinth, daffodil, and anemone; in the summer with buttercup, daisy, and foxglove ; and in the autumn with glorious heather. Such a nook partly divided tho Faverton grounds from Rochmound—the name of the Dawson property. It was here that the young people had developed their acquaintance; it was to this spot that Fairfield, on tho bright October afternoon. to which we havo now arrived, had bent his steps, resolved to shako off his lethargy,. ana pass from tho chrysalis state to a life of energy. Rosey was puUing in pieces a nosegay of purple heather and beating a tattoo with her French shoe, whon her lover uttered tho words reported faithfully above, and she neither accepted nor rejected tho arm which had stolen round her waist. ' Why do you uot answer ?' ho enquired, after a minute had elapsed, and taking from, his lady's fingers the debris of heather. ' Oh !' answered she, pettishly, * you are nwfully serious lately. You aro no fun at all now, Seymour; no fun at all, naughty boy,' sho added, tickling his nose with tho oue heather spray sho had been permitted to retain, 'Rosey,' said the young man, very gravely, ' sometimes I cannot make you out at all. Sometimes I fear that this is but: trifling on your part, and that you do not understand tho depth of my regard for you.' ' I do believe you are jealous of Captain Stanmore—the gaUant handsome captain, Who never pulls a long faco, and who is a dear, nice, quito too courteous knight, and not a tragical-faced gentleman, who ought nevor to go out without a great black cloak and brood-brimmed hat, with fiorco sable plumo,' was the vivacious, mocking reply. ' You would bo serious, Roscy, if you but know how dismal have been my feelings of late.' ' Goose!' ' Perhaps I am, fair lady. Perhaps mino is a wildgoose chase.' •Raven!' ' Yes, croaker that I am, raven as weU as goose. Sometimes I listen to the rooks in the elms, and fanoy that they chatter to the perpetual tune, " Then the bird said nevermore,"' replied Seymour, stiU dolorous. 'Come, Knight of the Rueful Coun tenance,' rejoined tho lady,, ever bantering, ' for mercy's sake forbear, or you will give mo ague of the heart as acute as that which makes old nursoy shiver on the rainy moorland.' And then, seeing that she had gone far enough, and that Fairfield was suffering from deplorablo dejection, she did become serious—at anyrate serious in her attempts to rouse and cheer the sufferer. She called into play the thousand and one arts by which women, I doubt not from the very creation of the world, have enslaved man kind, and turned their weakness into irre sistible strength. She pulled his ear, nestled closer to his side, rumpled his hair, pouted her lips, looked archly and smiled like a siren, pretended that he cared nought for her, said in simulated dis tress that he was a horrid, ugly, good-for nothing, dear, nice, spoilt, ridiculous old fellow; and in the space of five minutes and under had dispersed all the clouds, sent the Melancholy Jacques about his business, and called into being instead Seymour Fairfield, all radiant with faith and hope. Nevertheless, they did after an hour of pleasant idleness in the clough return to. the subject with which this little interlude opens; and, though Seymour found it a hard task to pin his volatile companion down to tho point for five minutes together, it was arranged before they separated that Dawson pere should be interviewed in tho morning, and tho acquaintance, if possible, converted into an opon definite engagement. Rochmound was, as the reader may sup pose, Bomowhat of a parvenu establish ment. Mr. Dawson rather liked tho idea than otherwise. ' Wo must walk boforo wo can run,' ho said to his wifo when thoy emigrated from Oldham, where the earlier money-making miUs wore situated, to their spick-and-span mansion overlooking Faverton Hall. 'We've got to learn how to bo gentleman and lady, old lass, and that is better than having to learn how to bo beggars. Some of the folks I know will laugh at Peto Dawson's horses and carriage and liveries; but let 'cm laugh. I say, Susan, old lass, so long as pocket's full, let 'em laugh, and be blowed to 'em.' This was a favorite line of argument with our honest rough-and-ready cotton- spinner, and the laugh with which ho would round off his simple confession of faith was as sonorous as the diapason of a church organ. Tho morning after the love-making in the clough, Roscy, fresh and fair in her morn ing robe, followed her father into tho hall, and began putting a rosebud into his button-hole. 'Well, little lass,' he said in his hearty voice, and relapsing, as all Lancashire men do, when thoir feelings are alive, into the quaint broad dialect of their shire. 'Well, little lass, thou'rt gotten to bo a gradely fine geU now, and aw hope thou'lt be as good as thour't fine. Dost want owt of t'owd feyther ?' he asked, surmising that Miss Rose was not lingering round for nothing. ' No, papa, I want nothing. Only Sey mour Fairfield intends to call upon you this morning. That's all. I thought per haps you would like to know,' she answered. ' Seymour Fairfield intends to call upon me this morn, does he? Reet lass. Aw'U see th' mon. It'll be business may be. Let th'lad call at th'mill.' This was said firmly, and with a signifi cant stress upon the latter sentence. Hu knew, without doubt, the cause of the in-. tended visit, and Rosey hQpe-dta would! have received their young neighbor at Rochmound. Well aware was she that in the counting house at Ancoats Mill Peter Dawson was as insensible to sentiment as tho fly-wheel in his ongine-room. Probably. disappointment found expression in her face, for ho looked at hor for a moment thoughtfully. ' How much dost really care for Sey-. mourP'ho asked her bluntly. , . , ' I don't know, papa. I liko him-' ' Dos t like him well enough to sup porriteh in a cottage wi th' lad P' ' I like him, papa. Ho is very good;' ' Aw'vo nowt against Seymour, lass. Th' lad's good cnou'. But dost luv him so weel that thou'd give lip Rochmound for him P' i ' I shall do nothing against your wishes,! dear papa,' she said. ' That's a good lass. Thouknow'st what' my wishes be, Rosey. Aw understood th,ee aw think. Good-bye, lass.' And as the dog-cart swerved rapidly \ round the corner of the high-road, making towards Manchester at a fair thirteen miles an hour pace, Rosey went back to the break- ' fast room, and told her mother how poor Seymour intended to speak to papa during . the day, and how papa s manner indicated I that poor Seymour would not meet with much encouragement. Meanwhile Mr. Dawson, absorbed in his own thoughts, sat in his corner of tho dog cart, and mused sternly, coming eventually to this conclusion: —' Well, well, Rosey s not the girl to break hor heart about any one. I don't like to think it about my own flesh and blood, but she hasn't the true heart of her mother. Yet she's a good girl, as good, I suppose, as boarding-schools, and novels, and fine company can let her be. Yes, Rosey's clear-headed when she likes, and isn't the one to throw herself away.' Rosey at this time was sauntering through the conservatory, humming a 'Madame Angot' waltz, and teasing a hideous poodle Soon to her entered Mr. Seymour Fair field, bright and enthusiastic. His spirits were a littlo dashed when he was told that Eapa hod gone into town, having urgent usiness that demanded his early presence; but the fresh comeliness of his Rosey soon restored his animation. ' I had quite a scene with the Colonel this morning,' he said by-and-by. 'Nothing unpleasant, I hope, Seymour.P' she asked. 'In the end, no,' he replied. ' The dear old father, aB you know, will never hear of my going into business, and at the bare suggestion of such a thing this morning he became positively angry,' ' The bear!' ejaculated Rosey, poutipg ' No, not so bad as that, pretty one,' said Seymour. ' I often feel sorry for him. He seems to liye in quite a world of his own, and it pains him to think that we have, upon some subjeots, no feelings in common- I really, however, this morning, got. him to moke an admission.' n , ,7 'Did he confess his faultsP' ' No, Miss Trifler, he did not confess his faults. The good Colonel has few faults to confess, bless him. No ; ho went so far as to admit that it was time I sallied out jnto tho world —flow far from the gloomy old nost —and sought my fortune. • But tho Hall will bo yours somo day, Seymour P' Roso suggested. 'God forbid, dear child, that I should wait for any dead man's shoos* much less my father's,' answered he. ' If I meet with hope from my interview in Ancoats by-and by, I have a scheme which you shall dis cuss with mo, and I'll go forth to battle with silken scarf and spurs affixed in true crusader spirit by the white fingers of my lady love.' ' The white fingers of my lady love wi!jl be crushed to jelly if they are squeezed in that style,' answered she, releasing her hands and cutting a camellia for tho young man's coat. ' But what is this scheme P' 'It scorns, Roscy, there is a place called Queensland.' ' I know. Somewhere in New Zealand, is it not P' sho interposed. ' Not at all,' laughed the other. * The Colonel was as far astray as you in the matter. His notion was that it was a de pendency of Victoria or West Australia, but we conned our atlas, and discovered that it is a new colony—the most promising of all the Australasian group—possessing enormous resources, and just now in tht heyday of prosperity. Six years ago Talbot Carey, a younger son, who had married and starved for years on his expectations, re ceived his portion—' ' Yes, like the prodigal son. Goon Sey mour.' 'Up to the receipt of the portion, no doubt, frivolous Rosey —leave my curls alone, you giddy girl—the comparison to the prodigal son holds good. But no farther, except that he went into a far country. He did not spend his substance in riotous | living, nor did he take pot-luck with the swine at their dejeuners of husks with nothing to follow. He, on the contrary, worked hard, lived frugally, persevered, at first against heavy odds, then with glimmer ings of success, until finally two years of good seasons put him on the high road to ■fortune. He is now an enormously rich niau.' 'Quite a story, is it not? Was he a gold digger?' Roscy asked. ' SUly girl! Everybody appearato fanoy that a rich Australian must necessarily be a gold digger, walking about in a panama hat and jack boots. He was not a gold digger. He was a squatter, and his gold was nothing more than nice, soft,, white fleeces of wool.' ..,, ' WeU, Master Fairfield,' asked the : young lady, ' and is it your plan to ask far the portion that falloth to your share, and, tp depart into a far oountry to share the good luck of Master Carey. P. ' That is the scheme, quiok-witted one,' answered Fairfield. ' The colonel had been talking the matter over with. Carey's uncle yesterday, and was fuU of it this morning. He even hinted that.he would cancel a resolution he has religiously kept till now, and raise a mortgage upon Faverton. But what do you say, Ropey P' ' Suffioient for the day is the eyU thereof/ . 'IsthataUP* ... .... ' AU at present, Sir Squatter.' ;,. ' Well, Roseyv we wdl, not anticipate. Will not meet troubles half way.' 'Now be off with you, Seymour. Au revoir,'  , x ■ . So, kissing her.hand and humming an OfTenbochian air, Miss Dawson disappeared with her poodle and flowers. ' Sometimes Rosey puzzles me,' he thought, as. ho. walked slowly downi the gravel-walk; 'one hour she willbe. shrewd, clearhcadod, the next giddy as a school girl; now she seems to overwhelm one with affection, now tp banter and tease, or trans form herself to ioe. You see her, eyes soft as love itself*, then you see the laughing blue become a stony gray. Ah! me Per fect lore casteth out all fear, does it P A pretty lover I am,; forsooth* Q critit rising and doubting in this manner. Well, well. As the play hath it: Time tries alL The spindles were rattling in deafening chorus,.the engines, were throbbing till tbA foundations of tho great eptton-miU of Dawson and Co., in Anpoats-lane, shook again, and the faqtory girls were singing at their task when Mr. Fairfield sent in his name to Mr. Dawson. Ho smiled to think that amid so much din,-and grime, and dust he should be intruding his light affairs of love. 'Good morning, Mr. Fairfield. What can I have .the,pleasure of doing .for you P* he said, with scarcoly a trace of his tarn* oashire dialect —sure sign, .*». the visitor was well aware, that it was Dawson-, the man of business, and pot the, father /-of Rosey, he* had now to deal with- .... ' Thanks Mr. Dawson,'he replied, taking the seat to which he. was. .motwfeed, and coming to the point at once..

They know, and none better than Rosey, that as they make their bed: so they must lie in it. If they choose to aot contrary to my opinions and wishes —for they both mean the same-rthey are free to do so; but they get no assistance from me.' .. ' May I interrupt you, Mr. Dawson P If Rosey married mc would she be acting contrary to your opinion—your wish?' 'If Rosey engaged herself to or married a man who had not adequate means of supporting her, she, most decidedly would/ ' That ihave not the means of supporting a wife is an admission it it** quite unneces sary for mo to make. . The fact is too pain fully patent. But Ido not ask Roscy as a wife until I have a right to speak of v^ax riage. I ask your sanction to our engaging ourselves. We can wait for each other,' ' And do you, Mr. Fairfield, think it fair to engage a girl to an indefinite period of waiting, which, may end in disappointment, to, in snort, monopolise the best years of her Ufe, and ruin her chances of settling comfortably? You see I am taking for granted that there is love in the business. That is the main crank of the whole ma chine of course. Even granting that you both have love strong enough, do you think it a manly fair thing to propose ? 'If both parties are willing, certainly. It should not be altogether a mercenary consideration.' * What does Rosey say ?' 'I have not spoken to her much upon the practical aspects of the question/ ' And what does the Colonel say ?'' ' He, like yourself, has always given us to understand that he wUI never interfere with us where honest affections are con cerned.' •Do you know that Colonel Fairfield would regard your marriage with my daughter as a mesallianoe P' 'No*' ' Do you know that I should regard such a marriage as a misfortune P* 'I was not propared to hear.that, cer tainly, Mr. Dawson.' .'You need not get your blood up, Mr. Seymour. I told you I should bo plain with you, and I will.be. I have definite projects for Rosey's future If sho wishes my consent she must marry cithor a rich man or a distinguished man. Saving your Erosence, I don't care a fig for pedigree, or lood, because I havo my own opinions about that; and I am sure, whatever you may think, tho old Colonel would go into fits if he heard what those opinions were. Tho Fairfields have their family principles and projects, and have had them for many a year. It would be better for you all if they hod not, so far aB I am entitled to judge. Some day the Dawsons may be an old family, too. I walked into Man ohestor without a shoe to my foot, a lad without a penny-piece to bless himself with. I was a factory hand when I married Susan Hopkins, another factory hand. What I am now anybody, will tell you. Why shouldn't I have ambition to found afamUyP Thero are worse ambitious than that. Peo ple in your class of life, and the miserable novel writers who trudo upon the snobbish ness of men and women, sneer at what they caU the vulgarity of wealth. AU humbug, envy, falsehood, Mr. Seymour ! There is no vulgarity under the sun to equal the vulgarity of aristocratic pretension, for it has no heart. Now, it is but reasonable that a man with my views and in my posi tion should look to his children tohelpnim. I look to Rosey to help me by making a sensible marriage. I repeat, I wish her to marry a rioh man or a distinguished man.' 'Such as what?' ' WeU, sir, in my own mind I had deter mined that she should not marry abything less than a member of Parliament. You smile, I observe. Smile away, sir. My notions arc .peculiar, but, suoh as thoy arc, they are not formed at random, and will not be, sponged out Uke the figures on a slate.* 'Mr. Dawson, will you answer mo a question or twoP' ' A dozen, if you like.'

' And if I oan persuade Rosey to wait and give me a chance, you wiil not object?' ' I will not object, but I'll do my best to persuade her to pledge herself to nothing.' 'Thank you, Mr. Dawson, I am grateful to you for giving me this interview. To men. Jike yourself I know time is money. Good morning, sir: thank you.' On tho second day aftor the strange interview between tho suitor and tho lady's fathor, there was another mooting between the young peoplo in Rochmound Clough. It was the last for a while Seymour Fairfield was on the eve of his departure for the colony of Queensland. ' I think you will miss me, Rosey,' said he. ' Miss you a good deal, dear Seymour," she answered. It was one of her soft moods, and the young man was under the potent spell. 'And we part absolutely free, the one toward the other ?' he observed. ' Except in heart,' she said in a low voice, returning tlie pressure of the hand clasped in hers. 'A thousand thanks, Rosey, for that word,' he answered. 'I shaU go in full faith that you wiU be loyal to me as I shall be loyal to you, and believing that there are happy days in store for us. I have entered upon a new era, Rosey, and you stand on its threshold inspiring me.' ' And you wiU succeed,' she told him. 'You must succeed, and you shall suc ceed, if my hearty wishes count in the reckoning.' In the gathering evening shades, as the sun trailed its skirts over tho western moorlands, just as the Babel of machinery for miles round became hushed, and the toilers thanked God that another day's work was done, Seymour Fairfield and Rose Dawson exchanged vows of undying affection. The former in shaking off the gloomy mood that had made Ufe an in cubus shook off his doubts and fears, and looked upon the girl without a lurking reservation to disturb the serenity of his love; the latter, at the near prospect of her lover's departure, was all bewitching- There was no more bantering or caUous ness. The moon was high in the heavens before the last fareweU was said at the little gate opening from the head of the silent clough into the Rochmound lawn. In the afternoon Fairfield had bidden goodbye to Mr. Dawson, telling him plainly that he intended to win the p*qze; and the cotton spinner, who had been con siderably taken aback by the practical behavior of the young lover in the counting house, and who had told his good wife at the usual Lancashire high tea on the even ing succeeding the interview that' if Soymour Fairfield had been kicked out into the world to battle for bare life he would have made a fine business man, spoke kindly, and wished him good luck as it he meant what he said. Kindly too had been the parting woJ-ds of Mrs, Dawson, whp had put aside her shawl head-dress and clogs when circumstances lifted her into another sphere, and assumed her new position with a gentle calmness that had never boen disturbed by adversity, and, stranger still, had not been broken by pros perity. Her honest heart warmed over tho love passages between her daughter and the Colonel'B son, though she shook her head as she thought of the family storms that must rage if the heir of the Fairfields con tracted a matrimonial alUance with Pete Dawson'B daughter. As for her husband, in his heart he now deemed the loVe chapter of his daughter conclusively closed. Ab told himself it was a lucky thing that sent the Fairfield heir to Queensland ; he, wq* now out of tho way, and Rosey would have a fair field. There was a sad parting that evening at Faverton HaU. The household had Men in a whirl of excitement. The emigration of the young master was decided upon at the spur oi the moment, and a ship sailing from London immediately offered a chance too good to be neglected. Nearly up to tho: moment of departure, therefore, there had been no time for sorrowing, regrets or drawn-out condolences, and It was only when the sound of tho carriage-wheels died away on the Stockport-road that it came home to the family that tormo-rrow. and henceforth, for how long no human tongue could tell, thero wpuld be a .familiar face missing. Such partings are tiie best. Pro longed farewells give a double pang to parting. Thus reasoned the Colonel, who was accompanying his soq, per lUf-hfcinftil,, to London, and who, in the course or a week, returned to report that the absent one had sailed under happy auspices for the new land of Promise at the Antipodes. • • •. , •• r , . « •,,..■ Tho horseman riding slowly down the mountain track, as the hot day declined, and across the plain of tussocky grass in tervening between it and the head station standing on the top of the gentle rise which bounded the horizon, was the same Sey mour Fairfield whom three years before we saw pacing gloomily the secluded walks around Faverton HaU. He had gone through his apprenticeship to Queensland life, and was abetter man in every way for tho experience. The free open life, the healthy air and exercise, had developed his muscles, broadened his shoulders, and em boldened his oye. When he gets across thb Elain and begins to ascend the grassy slope, c will have completed his sixtieth mile since sunrise. Tho horse, undbr the circumstances, was probably thinking of nothing in particular, but its master'B thoughts were far away. They were at Rochmound, roving from the dear old clough to Faverton Hall, and thenco to tho conservatory, for which the lories, king parrots, and rosellas on yonder station verandah were destined. In the clear cool mornings, when man and horse came fresh to their day's occupations, and sped like ono united elastio being across the plain, as in the eventide, under the passing glories and brief half-lights of sundown, Seymour's thoughts turned, truo as the mystic needle to tho pole, to weU remembered Lancashire scones. In the healthy flush of exhilarating morning, his heart would burn with courage and hope; in the sober repose of tho hour when night caUs upon man and beast to enjoy well earned respite, his soul was serene in its steadfastness. Everything that Fairfield touched seemed to prosper. Many and many an unfortu nate man envied nim his very name. In all his transactions he had succeeded, and he was too sensible not to acknowledge that there wero others equally de serving who, adopting precisely similar means, hud met with nothing but reverses. Life is after all a good deal like a game of whist; the finest science will give you no points unless you hold the cards. Fair field, so to speak, always held the cards. He was fortunate in the agents who intro duced him to colonial life, fortunate in his companions, fortunate in his journey ings, fortunate, in short, everywhere both in his going out and coming in. His por tion judiciously invested had doubled and trebled itself, and Carey of Cairngorm J ever repented him the day when he dmitted the son of his father's friend as partner, in the run. He brought luok with him the very first day, for as he entered the home-paddock on his arrival from Brisbane there commenced a downfall of rain, which, breaking as it did a drought Of long standing, and coming, as it did, at a critical time for the flocks, was in Carey's estimation worth ten thousand pounds steifling to the concern. His thoughts, aa we have seen, were far away, as he made for the sliprails, and at length drew rein at the verandah steps. He had been absent on business not con nected with either sheep, cattle, or horses, and only indirectly concerned with the sta tion. It was no love-making expedition, we may be sure, though upon second thoughts love was at the bottom of it. But it was love for Rosey Dawson, and it was part of a scheme condemning her very closely. He had been electioneering. All told, he thought he could show Mr. Dawson a bank balance, pr property convertible into one, that would satisfy his requirements on that head, and he nadFfor some time entertained the intention of becoming a member of the Queensland Parliament. True, to be a member of the Legislative Assembly in an almost infant colony was not what Mr. Dawson meant in that famous speech in his counting-house. But Fairfield was seized with, the whim, •uid on his return from this sixty-mUo ride the thing was settled. The squatters who inhabited, at wide intervals, the splendid pastoral district of which Cairngorm was the most valuable run wore well ploased to have a representative who, with the will, possessed the ability to do thera justice, and the aspirant had been an apt learner of colonial politics, and felt confidence in his powers to fulfil his trust satisfactorily. He had stood for the district upon the 'death of an old member, was returned without opposition, took his seat, at the beginning of the next session,, and was - selected to move tho address, in reply to his Excellency the Governor's speech. The Brisbane1 papers of the following day spoke of Mr. Fairfield as* a member ot rare promise, and the leaders on both sides of the House publicly compUmonted lum upon; the able, and evon eloquent, spoech. i Fairfield's good fortune followed him into thedomainof politics. Things move quickly ' in the-colonies, fortunes are sometimes, reputations of ten, made or lost at. a bound. It happened that in the course of his first session Fairfield found the attention of the little ParUaftent directed to legislation which the pubUo felt to be of the greatest importance to the future welfare of the colony. His natural intelligence and mental training enabled him to speak on thesip. 'matters in' tfueh a manner as to command at' once the attention and resps-ot of the Asaem-' bly and of the publio outside. > And when, after the prorogation, the young politician was offered ana accepted a.vacant seat ih the Cabinet, it Was felt that the Ministry "tyd recovered the strength which the vicife-' ■itudes of a stormy session had shaken. When Fairfield returned to his pastoral h6me he found its prosperity unchanged, but its appearance altered. His feathered pets occupied their old positions on the wide cool verandah, and showed signs of careful attention, but their numbers were increased. Other changes became appa rent to his quick eye: tho house itself nad been altered and enlarged. And when his partner oame out to welcome his return Fairfield's notioe was first attracted by the unwonted neatness of his appearance, lor he hid fallen very comfortably into the free and easy attire of the bush. He had no timeto wonder at the change, for, as he grasped his hand, a taU delicate girl stepped quiotly out behind him, and was introduced to Fkirfield as his daughter Ethel, tho only ctyild of his early marriage. ' Come out into this wild oountry, Fair field, to keep in order the homes of two morose old bachelors.' Ethel Carey had not the fair hair, the clear red and white complexion, the dashing and somewhat coquettish manner, of Rose Dawson. There appeared at first sight some taint of the hot-house about her white face —pale as Fairfield, with the one ideal always before him, thought it. But there was no lack of vigor in .her slight supple figure, the graceful easy carriage of nor body, or the pose of her small well-shaped head. And there was not the smallest sparkle of coquettishness in her large dark gray eyes other than that delicate aroma of self-oonsciousnoss which every beautiful woman, however simple-minded, possesses. For Ethel Carey was beautiful, with a deli cate high-bred beauty, Uke that of some choice flower developed under favorable circumstances and in congenial soU. Between these two thero was at once apparent a mutual attraction, which Ethel's father, who was fond and proud of his young partner, viewed with huge but secret dohght, calculating that Fairfield would soon be cured of his foolish infatua tion for the daughter of a Manchester cotton- spinner. But he had entirely mis taken the nature of the tie. Ethel, per fectly frank and loyal, was soon in posses sion of Fairfield's easily-read secret, and was proud of his confidence, proud of the friendship of a man who to his other attrac tions added the virtue- of such romantic constancy. It was as friends they cantered I across the wide plains or threaded the aromatio mazes or the thick forest in the pleasant evenings of a Queensland early | summer. On Fairfield's side tho friend. \---! ship was warm and genug_e, untinged by a I particle of deeper feeling; on Ethel's there j arose doubts and fancies, sternly repressed but troubling the serene current of her young life. Fairfield's stay at the station was neces sarily a short one; his presence was not needed, and official duties recalled him to Brisbane. There he applied himself to his work with such vigor as to disturb the official spiders which had already begun to spin their webs in the dark corners of the infant administration. He imparted such a degree of energy to the work of his department, and, bettor still, infused such a healthy tone into it, that when the Ministry with which he was associated ended tne short career usually allotted to colonial Governments, even political oppo nents regretted that the colony should lose the benefit of his administrative talents. And now Fairfield began to think he had served his period of probation, and was entitled to receive his prize. Letters had been exchanged between Roso and himself, warm and frequent on his part, cool and intermittent on hers. Finally the correspondence had been closed by her on the plea of a parental injunction. Fairfield regarded the doubts that persisted in in truding themselves as unpardonable dis loyalty, and stifled them with fond and vivid recollections of Roso in her most loving and melting moods. But they had the effect of hardening his determination to return. He found his partner able and willing to buy him out of the now greatly improved station, and he set sail for England amidst the loudly expressed regret of his friends, political and private. Ethel was very pale, and tears stood in her eyes as she pressed his hand and whispered her fervent hopes for his success and happiness. But when sho found herself alone she laid her heart baro for one agonising moment, and saw the deep and hopeless passion she had allowed to take possession of it. And nono but tho Power to whom sho wont for help know what it , cost her to drive under tho surface ull marks of the love that had mastered every fibre of her warm and loving disposition. Father and son stood faring each other in Faverton Hall, their hands locked in tho warm grip which with undemonstrative Englishmen means so much. Tho colonel's cheek was possibly a shade hollower, his wnite moustache not quite so full, but his stiff figure was -dpright as ever-*-perhaps even a littlo statelier as ho scanned the manly form of the bold dotermined-looking man that had replaced the drooping lacka daisical son who had left him to seek his fortune on the other side of tho globe. This was a worthy inheritor of tho old name, . wpo had won, in no ignoble fashion, enough to preserve at least tno ancestral homo, and keep back the desecrating tide of parvenu wealth. And the old colonel's joy was not lessened by the knowledge of a fact which, though hef eltitniustgivehis son pain, would yet save him from an alliance which he neveir liked. He lost no timo in bringing it forward. ' Seymour,' he asked, during a pause in the flood of questions and answers,' Was there any engagement between you and Rose Dawson P' 'None, sir. We were bound only by affection.' ' That is a bond whioh counts for very Uttle nowadays.' ' Not with men and women who are truo to themselves and to each othorP' •"Well, Seymour, I havo no dosirc to prejudice you, but it is weU that you should know that a Captain Stanmorc has been hanging about Rochmound, and paying more attention to Miss Dawson than I care about seeing a lady receive who has any claim to be considered your affianced wife. A deplorable puppy, this same Captain Stanmore. I Know that he is of good family, and I am told he is a favorite companion with the Prince; but his gene ral manner and bearing aro not of the kind that would havo been tolerated among gentlemen in my time. Tho world changes and does not improve. I hear that at the approaching election Captain Stanmorc is to stand in the Conservative interest; if ho does, I shall be tempted to abandon tho political creed of my family and turn liberal.' After this the conversation languished. Fairfiold had been in a school where men learn to decide quickly and act with promp titude. That very night saw him threading his way along the weU-rcmcnibcrcd path of Faverton Clough, its sequestered beauties half revealed by a full soft glory of moon light. Following the familiar track he found himself in Rochmound grounds, and face to face with Rose Dawson and Captain Stanmore, who were sauntering, side by side, he whispering eagerly, she looking smilingly down and swinging her broad brimmed hat. Of course there was a start and a little shriek, but Rosey displayed a degree of presence of mind which did at least credit to her head and nerves. ' Seymour Fairfield or his ghost; which is it P ' ' Myself, Roscy, and in the flesh.' ' How glad papa and mama wiU be to see you. Let me go first and prepare them for the shock. Have you forgotten Cap tain Stanmore P Let mo introduce him.' And Rose hurried away, leaving Fair field to digest his mortification, and follow in tho company of tho gallant captain, who pulled his long moustache rather angrily, and asked how fellows managed to exist in Australia. Fairfield received a welcome in which embarrassment and friendliness were strangely mingled from Mr. Dawson, and a gentler greeting in which the latter feeling was alone apparent from his wife. Rosey laughed and chatted with feverish animation, and Fairfield had a good oppor tunity of observing her. He left her a dashing girl, he found her a fine handsome woman. Her form was matured, the sprightlincss of youth had hardened into something very like -fastness, and there was a hard blue gleam in her eyes, which now seemed more fitted to sparkle than to melt. He had no opportunity for a privato inter view, and went home in a very dissatisfied frame of mind. % Early tho next day he was at Rooh naound, asked for ana obtained a privato interview. Rosey was evidently norvous and embarrassed: her color came and wont fitfully, imparting to her appearance an air of softness which in Fairfield's eyes was infinitely moro attractive than her sclf possossed demeanor of the previous even ing. She placed her hand timidly in his, and he retained it. ' Is this how we meet, Rosey P' ' What else would you have, Mr. Fair— Seymour P It is all so strange and Unex pected.' ' Never a day passed, Rosey, but I found time to dwell on your image, and you!' 'Remember, Seymour, thero was no engagement.' ' I remember it, Rosey.' ' And you know,' said the lady, endeavor ing to get up a sense of injury, ' it was all very well for you in that horrid desert to think —that is, you had nothing else to think about. lam sure I have been mpst constant to your memory; and Captain Stanmore —' * Well, what about Captain Stanmore P' ' I am sure you have no right to look at mo in that manner, Seymour. Captain Stanmore has boen most kind and con siderate. It was impossible for me to reject attentions so delicate and so unobtru sively offered. I told him plainly that I was pledged in honor to another, though papa insisted on it that our engagement was in no way binding. And, since Captain Stanmore has decided to stand for the county, papa has doelared that I ought to give nun more encouragement. I have oen so—so —so—wret —cned.' And Rosoy put on the whole armor of woman, sinking on a couch and covering her face, but not sufficiently to conceal the tears that trickled from between her fingers. Fairfield stood by, not unaffected cer tainly, but not ready as in the old days to surrender at discretion. Australian life is favorable to the growth of mental back bone. ' Rosey, I have one question I must put to you. Do you love me, as you told me you did when I went away P' ' I don't know,' she replied, not looking up. ' It is all so changed, and I am in such a painful position.' ' I have no desiro to give you pain, Rosey, and I take your answer—good Dye.' ' Don't go, Seymour,' she cned, rising, ' that is not what I meant. Givo me time.' ' Time to chooso between Captain Stan more and my self P—thank you, Rosey. I do not think I am prepared to enter into the competition.' ' At least, Seymour, try and contest the election with tho captain. Papa has so made up his mind, that if he wins it I shall be forced to accept him.' ' And your hand, Rosey, is to bo the price of tho contest.' ' WeU, sir, and if it is to be,' she replied, smiling her old saucy smile through her tears,' what of that P Is not the idea worthy of your grand and romantic notions P' Seymour stood a moment irresolute. ' I shall contest tho electorate. Good morning, Miss Dawson.' That evening Fairfield said to his father over their wino, ' I havo made up my mind to contest the county with Captain Stanmore.' The colonel's face brightened. ' But it shall be in the Liberal interest.' ' I think,' was the reply, after a short hesitation, ' you arc right. If such a man as Captain Stanmorc is to be the champion of the Conservatives, a gentleman will have to take the other side.' Great was tho amazement of the political quidnuncs when Seymour Fairfield, of Faverton Hall, was announced as the Liberal candidate in opposition to Captain Stanmore, who had calculated confidently on being floated by the rising tide of Con servative reaction into Parliament, and the secure debt-proof haven of a marriage with wealthy Pete Dawson's only daughter. ' I always did like the lad's spirit,' was the old cotton spinner's comment on the strange news. Rosey, annoyed at Sey mour's abrupt behavior, accepted in a more pronounced manner the Captain's atten tions ; till a match between them was con sidered a settled thing by the gossips of the country side. Fairfield avoided all chance of meeting Rose. She had effectuaUy changed the whole current of his feelings. Perhaps the doubts that ho had so steadily repressed had managed nevertheless to undermine his affection; certainly it collapsed entirely. It appeared as if the scales had fallen from his cyos, and he saw clearly. The ideal Roso he had loved so long and deeply had vanished, nevor to return ( her image had been shattered by the disclosure of the substantial reality: the heartless, vain, frivolous coquette who wished to balance his true and steadfast affection against the interested attentions of a rival. If ho had entered into what she had chosen to con sider a compotition for hor hand, it was with no viow of claiming the prize. But he was determined to win. His Australian experience proved of priceless value to him. There he had loarncd to know men divested of their social crust; and in his canvass the people of his county who had regarded with suspicion tho candidature of a Fairfield of Faverton Hall found to their surprise that in him they had a man who knew mon and how to lead them. He left to his rival all the ordinary electioneering devices, tho flattery of old women and the admiration of squalling babies, and went straight to the mon. Among tho laboring class he soon made himself known as a man who knew thorn as thoy really are, who could understand them a great deal better than the oily mob orators who half disgusted, half amused, tho shrewder of their class. The self made men of the place found that he could accopt their position, and, while not de ferring to their money, yet honored the perseverance and ability that had been displayod in amassing it. The gentry, amazed at finding a Conservative Fairfield canvassing in the Liberal interest, were yet fain to admit his personal superiority to his rival. The peculiarity of, the election attracted attention even in London. The speeches of the young Australian squatter, son of an old county house, were carefully reported; and impressed readers with a sense of freshness and power. Tho excitement grew as the polling day drew near; it had become a trial of strength between parties; and the ono side, at least, felt that if Fair field was successful they would gain moro than a doubtful seat. And when the eventful day arrived, and Fairfield headed tho poll by a largo majority, the popular enthusiasm found echoes in distant and unexpected quarters. Almost the first thing that the successful candidate did was to indite the following note:— 4My dear Rose,—l have no desire to hold you in any way to a bond which was no doubt foolish, and which has evidently proved irksome to you. Accept my best wishes for your happiness with Captain Stanmore.' He enclosed in it a crushed and faded flower. It was the camellia Rose had pinned on his coat when he left her to seek her father's consent to an engagement. At best it had been a hot-house flower, un naturaUy forced and devoid of scent. Now it was but a little withered heap of colorless leavos. Within a month the county paper an nounced the approaching marriage of Miss Roso Dawson to Captain Stanmore. A few weeks afterwards Fairfield was in a brilliant London drawingroom. His S;ood fortune, in everything but love, fol owed him; and society in her sovereign caprice had made a favorite of the young man. He needed some distraction, for when the excitement of his election was over he had felt a strong tendency to sink into moody despondency. A man cannot cut out a part of his heart and cast it away as worthless, without feeling the loss. Not that he was a man to surrender himself without a struggle to melancholy ; he was mado of too good stuff for that. But he did not enter into the gay scene around him with the zest which would have been natural to him. His interest was, how ever, suddenly awakened as a tall graceful figure, which seemed strangely famUiar, entered the baUroom. ' Why, Ethel—Miss Carey, how do I meet you here P' ' I think I may ask the same question, Mr. Fairfield;' and Ethel's beautiful pale face was suffused with the most delightful glow of pleasure. The meeting was soon explained. She had fallen into ill-health, and her father, anxious about her, had decided on a trip to the old country. At that moment he was at home grumbling over a severe cold and the absence of sun shine, while she, under the chaperonage of one of his old friends, was enjoying her first glimpse of society. The ballroom afforded no opportunity for explanation, but a visit next day at Mr. Carey's temporary residence gave Fairfield a hearty welcome, and the chance of a long interview with Ethel. Fairfield told her the story of his arrival, of Rose's conduct, and of nis determination. * And are you sure, Seymour,' said Ethel, E lacing her hand with a frank movement in is, * that you have got quite rid of your love ?' • Sure of it, Ethel. The Rose that reigned in my heart out in Queensland was, I find, an ideal. The real Rose is quite a different woman: there is nothing in common be tween her and the phantasm I loved. Per haps it is to be my fate never to realise my ideal, And yet * ' And yet what, Seymour P' asked Ethel, looking frankly in his face, though over her delicate countenance a delicate flush was stealing, while her eyes softened strangely. Fairfiold clasped the hand that he yet held without speaking for a moment. ' I am going to sa^T Ethel, what I ought to leave unsaid. I meant by that incom plete sontenco that if it had been my for tune to havo met you with a free heart my. fate might havo been a different and a happier one.' Ethel's face flushed more deeply, and her eyes drooped; yet sho found voice to whis per, 'Is it too late?' 'If I dare to hope ! But, Ethel, what right have I to offer to you the withered after-crop of a soured affection?' A few momonts later Ethel was whisper ing her confession, and Fairfield learned how he had always been her hero. Her father hailed tho news with joy. ' Fairfield, old man,' he said, relapsing into the languago of the Cairngorm dis trict, ' you shall havo my little pile, and £20,000 of it shall be paid down on your wedding day.' There is not much more to tell. The young heir of Faverton Hall had now money as well as blood and brains. The possession of the last quality became so apparent to the leader of his party, that hor Majesty was advised to revive a title long dormant in his family, nnd as Lord Faverton, he was re-elected by his constituents at the last dissolution of Parlia ment. As might be supposed, his romantic story was in every mouth, and Fairfield's electioneering became a f>roverb. It is not every candidate that oses a sweetheart, gains a wife, secures a seat, and bags £20,000 by one happily con ceived election contest. Rose Dawson was punished for her treachery to a loyal heart. Tho gallant captain turned out to be a spendthrift at home and a blackleg abroad. He was the man whose services the Queen in a Gazette Extraordinary took the liberty of dispens ing with. Lord Faverton, tbey say, will bo a mem ber of the next Liberal Ministry. Ho came to Queensland last year, and brought his pale beautiful Queensland wife with him, and during his visit whispered to his former griitical leader that should he enter the ritish Cabinet it would be in connection with the colonies. Who knows, therefore, whether, to thc_ other gains of Fairfield's, election, something of even imperial interest' to the colonies will not yet be added P Those who wait wiU see.
