The Northern Argut reports tbe follpwing oase of mistaken identity »— Some two months- since the body of a nun was found floating tin the river near the upper ferry. An inquest was held, and two persons tdtoHfied the body as that of one Alexander Stewart— and aa Alexander Stewart it was buried, and nothing more was heard of, the affair until a few days back, when the boatman at theiipper ferry was fairly frightened, by seeing A$Bxamier Stewart walking towards the boat for the pprbbaiof crossing tbe river.

Speculation has been rife (says (be Maryborough Chronicle) with regard to a robbery oommitted on the dwelling of Benry Palmer, Esq., between the boors of half -past 11 on Sunday night last and day break on Monday morning. Tbe details, as related to us, put romance in the sU&dts;, and afford another proof that truth is stranger than fiction. Mr Palmer aud his family retired to rest at their usual hour on Sunday evening, leaving the front room window* open, and yet the first intimation Mr Palmer had of the robbery was upon his going on Monday morning to his office, which is built upon tha verandah. He aaw that a hole, eighteen by nine inches, had been burnt through the outside and the lining- boards, and an entrance effected by this means. Upon a further examination of the premises it appears aa though the burglars had attempted to burn a hole through tbe verandah floor, as several nafings'badJpeen removed, and the grass waa partially destroyed at the place. authors, as a new ladder had been used for toe pur pose of stripping some doaen »ypgl»r off the roof, and a large quantity of water was then thrown upon the fire. All the clothes banging In tbe office were saturated with water ; some loose, silver, copper tokens, a watch belonging to Mr Palmer, and some tobacco were the property missed, ao far as is yet ?known. Fortunately, a large sum of irioney, which had previously been lying exposed on * shelf, had been deposited in a place of safety by Mr Palmer during the day, otherwise the loss might have been larger. It seems that whatever, noise was made waa not sufficiently loud to awaken the sleepers,' neither did the dog give tbe alarm, although it is usually extremely vigilant and Aero*.
