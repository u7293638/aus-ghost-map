LORD ONSLOW AND THE GHOSTS It seems that Clnndon, one of the scats of Lord Onslow, has for some time been haunted. At least the Inmates believed su, and Investigations have been carried on with the view of "laying" tlie appari- tion. The cxGovernor of South Austra lia has only recently entered Into pos session of the house himself, and In answer to a letter from Lord Rule, cn behalf of a society of which lie hi vle- prosldcnt, asking whether tho investiga tions might be continued, writes:— "While acknowledging the courtesy of the offer. I would point out that with the departure of the tenantr. anil their ser vants al! opportunity of unuuuiklug Im postures by cro.'ir- exumlnatlon of the or. cupantH of tho house hns ceased; and, moreover, I am determined not to allow nny repetition of such nonsense. I may add that the adult members of my family sleep with loaded revolvers by their bedsides, with which they will not hesitate to shoot at any 'ghost' who seeks to play tricks on the members of my household." Wo ("Westminster") venture to predict that tho last of the Ciandon ghost has been seen. These "perturbed spirits" have a horror of re volvers. The highest mountain in the world Is Mount Everest, in the. .Himalayas— 28.000 feet, or live and thfco quurter tulles.
