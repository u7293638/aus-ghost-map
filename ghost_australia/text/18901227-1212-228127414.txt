Gaspard passed the afternoons in watching the jeiigles that frequented the frozen summits, and Ulrich in regularly returning toj the neck of the Genijni to ; eonteliiplate the village.

The Snow began agnijn and continued : they were prisoners anil^ left the' shelter of jjheir d wejlings .no : mkije di\ddingithe duties b^fwi-Bh tliem;.ind fulfilling them scrupulously. U1 rich m ashed and cleaned the relssels and^cut the ttoIkI, while Gbspard teodeiî the fire, watchejl the soup and did the cooking, therr monotonjiius work interspersed with gabies of cards.j Both of; them calm arid placid men. resigned to 'this wintering in the summits} they never quarreled. Oceasi^n|al'v, when the weather permitted, ^hl (Ja-paiii 1 wohld take his gun and hunt, the 'chamois, n fealst dav at the inn ojf Sehwareri bach resulting. One morning he started as ns U;i[ • the therniomcjter ranged 1-iS deg^. below zero. The smi had not yet risen, for the hunter hoped . to atirprij-n the ajittfials as thev led 011 (he V.'ildstriiliel. ' t'lvich, . left alime, re- 'n ined Hi bed till 1 < I o'clock, a propensity ii,. biredinot indulge in in the presence! of the old guide. ; He breakfasted \yith Sam. who pas.-ed his days dozing before the fire, then seated himself to wait for fiaspardj Tired a{ last, he got up and went to meet him. ' The -snow that had fallen s t,. :idily had leveled the deep valley. 1 filled the erevices. • [faced the lakes and '• ;•.-.win'd |t 11 e rocks till ihey appeared he-; I v 'on the towering summits like huge: •ah;*e tubes, blinding and dazzling. ' j I-"or three weeks ; Ulrich had not been' alile to go to tlie erifi of the vallev to re-! • rard the village. It was a good time ;! he would go there jnovr, before climbingi (he cliffs of the Wildstrubel. ; It, too. was buried under the snow, and; tin- dwelling? in their pale mantle, no! longer distinguishable. Turning to the 1 n>ht he r^ained the glacier of the Loemern, going with the long stride of the| jiractisedi mountaineer, supporting liimself] hv his irfjn pointed staff plunged into the! snow, his piercing eye catching and; scrutinizing every little black spot upon tlie surrounding whiteness. At the spot; where Gaspasd usually; rested he hesi-; tated a rriometit, wondering if the hunger had taken liis accustomed path ; thenj started again with 3 swifter, anxious gtèp.î The day was ending, the summits red-[ den ing with the setting sun ; a cf)l{I[ wind hlexy in short gusts over the crystHlj surface, j Ûlrich "shouted aloud, sha^j vibrating cries, that died nway in the: silence, slept in the mountains, or Vpstj themselves in - those motionless frozen! waves like the cries of thr birds! over the sea. .Nothing answered! him. He walked riipidly on. The Suni had sunk below the [peaks : its reflectionj still crimsoned thcj !sky, but the valley] was grer and sombre. Ulrich felt alarmed.^ It seemjfd to him as ii ^he' silence, llie solitude.'the deadly winteriof the ghiciprs held him, were going to stjop his blood, to stiffen his limbs and turn' him t" 'ice. He began to run, flying towards his dwelling. Perhaps Gaspard had returned and was waiting for hi|n, sitting Iw'fore the fire, ^ dead chamois lathis feet. Soon the inn was before him, hut no smoke came from its chimney;. Ulrich ran faster than ever, opened the door and entered. Sam rushed to meet him. but no one else—Gaspard Hari wja-• not. ther^ ! Still he searched and looked as if lie expected to i find him hiding inj a Corner. He lighted the fire and prepared the ?ov,p, from 1 time to time going to (he door and dooking out. hoping alwavs to see (Jaspard coming. j NighUoll, the pallid, livid light of the: mriuniain's, that crawled along the, horizon. a slow, increasing yellow, ready atj n breath to drop behind the summits. Perhaps Gaspard had broken his leg, had fallen inU'/a hole, hiul twisted his ankle, :.::d v, as hying in itlie snow suffering. -t ifT<;ned jiv the cold, and calling f<jr help with all [liis strength in the silence those. ! solitudes. Hut where? Ten <ir twenij" n?en, working in all directions,; would he [required to find a man lost in; (hat )mtrieii«i(v. Nevertheless, Ulrich det el mined to start ^ilone with Sam. it' Ga^jiard Jind not returned by lriidiiiglit^ He made liis preparations—two days' food in a ! sack, his steel climbing liookj b : s. MafT,;a sf tout 0„, r, ro;ie and his hatchet ' ;i"d tlien jlie waited. I Plie he tiro mared in the chimney, the dog snored m the light of the flames, the elocl; beai like the hejvrt, in even, regular strokes ip its case of wood. He waited —liis ear quickened (o the slightest -otind—tjhe lightest |hrush of the wind across' the roof and|''walls. Midnight struck—Gaspard hndi not come ! He got tip, covered the fire with iislies and wood, called' Sarn and started for the Wildstrnbel. [For three |iours he ascended, hold ing jhv hisjelimbîng hook, cutting stejis in [the ice, hreJithless, panting, but always higher and hi£dl<"" followed bv the faithful Sam. It was Kix hours before he leached jhe iiomt flint the old hunter freqnentejl for chamois! Dav was breaking^ a strange I;ght. springing no one knew whence, through the b^isf^ing peaks, jsprendmg. growing, deepening» to (he tint,I of iosv flesh. The red sun was behind the «ullen giants of the Bernoises Alps. I 1 Ulrich continued, going like a hunter, lialf ber.t. spying for 1 races}, calling constantly to the dog : " Hunt, tny fine fclhov. hunt !" in vnin. He dpscerided again] searching the golfs with liis eye, listening itwitli liîs ear to the ground, snouting, hallooing and sending his voice ech:nn<>- frfim ^loint. to point Nothing jinswered litni. !

He gathered up -h energy and his failing vigor, aiid fallii I dipping, plunging from height to bei it, descended toward the Inn.<j>f Scln arenbach, Sam following I>ehind hipt limp ng on three legs. The hou=e was cm ]H v. the fire ont. Ulrich relit it, alte :Uld lept, too exhausted to do or think bf He slept a long time. Suddenly rfior* a rhi him tiiat se, a cry, a name, " Ulrich !'" aroused rom his tor|ior. Was it a dream, penetrating call, a dream such as comcsj(p the soul of the anxious?

"Gaspard!" "Gaspard!" " Ga; paid ! ' cried Ulrich again, then wniie i. XoLuing—nothing ! Seized witlh a feai that shook him to the bone he re.- turne 1 to the inn and closed the door. Gasp ml was dead somewhere in t; (he mountains, and at the moment of dying had deptl white =uht in dv pan 10 to til slept called him—called him from the s of those hidden ravines, their less far more dangerous than tlie rane.an shadows. Yes, Gaspard, ng had thought of him ; his com- 1 his soul set free had flown awav inn of Schwarenbach, where Ulrich it had c i'd to him its last alien. perha is its -curses, its reproaches upon tli'' mar. vho hail noi. sought for him sufficient! -. He felt everywhere—behind tlje door, lehind the wall, thinking to find the voice ; wandering fr<,m place to place like a nig it bird that ruffles its feathers «gain: t a lighted pane ; he wished to go out, bit dared not, yet was equally afraid to sta - 111—horror had seized upon hinj. As long as the body of the old guide was not flound and placed on consecrated groun 1, the panthom wnndf would continue to \VT h the. return of the sunlight Ulricih was more assured, though still tortured with t loughts of the old man lying in th)3 enow. But when night crowned thfe glacier s again new terrors assailed him. He passed into the dismal kitchen, lighted a single candle, and 'to the side of tlie fire, listening at every *tep if the fright: ful cry of the night wofculd again cross tlijs mournful stillness.; He was miserabli! and unnerved, liWis any otjher man _whojhad never been alonh before in a desertilof snow, 2,000 -fefjit* above the inhabited earth—above th'p abodes of human kind—above life itself, alone 5n the frozen sky: A mad desire to fly too possession of him, no matte* where, no matter| how; to descend to fjoechi even if ihe Ifell into an abyss himnt .self; but the dead j man liis companioqt. barred the way. At least we.ary with walkin he threw himself upon a chair, He d re ided the bed as one dreads a hauntagatn, ed place once, as jhe sat All there, it canie that strident cry, " Ulrich i" Ulrich!" He threw up his hands, he started U> his feet to repulse the ghost, but fell back, his chair overturning with a crash. Sam, startled by the noise, began to howl and to; rush from place to place, 11 learn whence came the threatened di nger. At the door he stopped and sniïed beneath it, his hair on end, his tail erect. Ulrich, bewildered, seized his eh t.: • by the leg. ! " Do l't come in !" he shrieked, " don^t come in, I tell you ; I'll kill you !" The dog excited by his; mannef, barked and howled louder than ever. As nothing c.nne, Inwever, he quited. and once motte ptretche 1 himself before the fire, but not to sleep —he was still restless and uneasv and leaj ed at a moment, IJlrich als reined li senses, but fealing exhaustejl by str.'iir and terror he went to the cujk board and poured himself glassful aftc| glassful of the brandy that was alway kept the e—he who j rarely touched a drop if liquoi. It strengthened liim wonder} fully, particularly his courage. A burn> ing fire ;eemed to fill his veins. He ate scarcely anything, but drank, and onl brandy. He lived thus fifteen days. At la it, one night, pushed to his last extremity, he threw wide the door—h ; t-o fly—but a gust of wind mej him in the face, the door slammed and Ulrijli cfosed and bolted it without perceiving (that Sam }vas outside. All at once -e, shivering before the fireplace, hie carted bent his ear—some one was crv in nud scratching at the door, th}e «all, th( ill of the windowaway!"' he icried ; Go "go awav !*' A long plaintive tone alone replied tj) him -|t this all îeason left him, dishy sipated horror. He ran from side tj) side, fro 11 corner to corner, striding to find a h ding place from the one outside; always r loaning, up and down the house, against ( he walls, tlié door, the step. At las the larted to the buffet filled with vessels ; ,nd provisions, atid with superhuman strength dragged it against the panels a id heaped upon it, piece by piece„ all the urmture tli fit remained—cliair.Sjj tables, b;d and niatltress.
