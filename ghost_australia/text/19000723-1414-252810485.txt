FIRE AND SNAKES- , An incident of the rfceent forest fires iu the Pine creek region is related by Bam Campbc-ll, who works iu the woods near Black weirs. Sa n was one of the crew of men sent out to *• back fire " (fight fire with fire), and he declares that their experience was most thrilling. While Wing fire to a thicket that crowned a, rocky ri'lgo, he and his crew were startled to find »>7~iisckes suddenly iu the midst of a lot of «3sl ;ttesnakes. The forest firewas adv.Tnru;g op Vr; side of the hill at a rapid rate. 11 > vvhistliiig. whin ing souud sis it devoured the hemlock iaL-s v.-ss terrific, and the men were bciit on building a line of fireto start toward it, hoping that when the two lines met the fury of the •.uiuts would be subdued for lack of material on '."h to feed. It was while thus employed that (rfy cncountered the snakes. The grouiid sceuseil to be literally alive with rattlers, the n pf iics crawling in the direction of a rocky bUifl not more than one hundred yards distant. The men were all equipped with high-topped leather boots and paid little heed to the snakes, stt-ppii g ou them as though they were hut harmless old sticks. Campbell says that tho rattling made by the reptiles could be heard above "the roar of the distant flames. " The backfire " uiad i by the tuen caught dozens of crawltxs and thef were burnod to ffle&th.Campbell; said he watched several of the rattlers fcive up tbe ghost." When tbe flamesadvanced so close that the snakes saw further escape was impossible they would ceil up in a heap, darting their heads angrily at the-tongues of flame,then suddenly relapse, when the heat overcame them, a..moment later to be devoured.
