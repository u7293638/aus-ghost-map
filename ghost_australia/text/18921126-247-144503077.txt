We recently reeelvsd a .xomtmanlcatlea .In .which the writer wys, . --uI:vru ^fi^^d i6cat,1, Did ke fancy his food was polsoaed.or did his natara rebel . apdut the noirishmeat lived on T It the -latter, why ! I«et hta alesx . the mystery ; Unuut ' Be says, ^ la the year. 1881 I changed jaywork Cram nil way porter to signalman. I had been dgnalma* twelve months, end thfta all at once, so to ipeak, 1 did not feel myself. My montk tasted bad, so that ordlaary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavosr ; tbe palate, to pat it in that i way, appeared to natf nothing to say %o ? ? them. One thing wms like Another, and none was good. My tongue was coated and ? fmrredj with a dark Use down the middle and yellow for round it. My breathe was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains tbxoegh the chest andshoslders which were always right before I had eaten anything. Then I was greatly troabled with wind. It would gather so it felt like a ball in my thinat, and act as if U would cboke me.' We cannot wonder that under these oircamstances oar friend failed to do justice to his meals. He adds thatthere was what he calls ' a pricking sensatioa' at his heart, as tboogL it were touched with eome ' sharp instrument. Then, agaio, at times he. was attacked with spasms, the agony of which was so severe that the sweat rolled off him. ' 1 dreaded,' he says, ' the thought of eating, and many a temnty meal have I made, for I toa* afraid to eat . 'After a time I got into a low, weak, nerrons condition, and felt miserable, as if something was going to happen, and this caused me to lose a great deal of sleep.' What he means by the fear of ' some* thing going to bappea 11 is, of coarse, the { fear of some calamity, each as the loss ef | 'his position, his own death, or the death of somebody dear to him. This was dae, as i he intimates, to the impoverished state of his blood (the life bearer), his nostrnng nerves, and tothe brain enfeebled by lack of nourishment. The night of this form of # illness is always tnll of ghosts and goblins, * the creatures of a restless and nngoverned Imagination. ' With great -difficulty,' he says, ' I stack to my work, fori had a wife and family depending on ma So I straggled on, but what I suffered for over two years is past my powers i»f description. I am sure mo one hat suffered *o muck a* I lucre done' In the latter statement he is undoubtedly wrong. One's own pain is always harder to bear than is one's notion ef his neigh boar's pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while geing through the aame wretched experience, only we don't happen to come in touch with them. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medical treatment had left him where it found him he chanced to read m a book of a case exactly HJte hi* own having been cored by Mother Seigel's Syrup. «!My -wife,' he says, 'got me a bottle at Mr. LangstaiTs, in Woodlesford, and after asing its contents the ailment left me and bas never-retained since that fortunate day. I should like tbe whole world to know what it did tor me. I have been employed by the Midland Bailway Company for eleven years.
