The' pieces produced were 'Ertna the Elf,' ' East Lynne,' ' Lady Audley's Secret,' and ' Lancashire Lass.' The people around there: were delighted with orio and 'all. Miss Willis and Company visited the mines, and were treatod very kindly; 'Mr W. Stubbs doing all ho could to entertain them. Visited George Town on Monday.add travelled through pouring rain so as/'to keep faith with' the public. ??'We were rewarded with a good house and very appreciative audience. In this district Miss Willis had hosts of admirers, and made many friends, and should she ever wish to return, I know there is a hearty welcome awaiting herself and company. I shall in 'all probability arrange with her now to. start for the N.W. Coast and Zeohan. If. so, there is a tr.at in store for my coast friends, for sho will ?« make hearts beat, .faces smile, and bring tears from the jolliesfc of those who have heartily laughed at me on my last trip, as ' good old Mary Anne.''— Carls.
