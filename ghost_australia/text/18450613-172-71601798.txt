GHOST CRAFT. An obscure writer, in 1766, thus expresses him self as to ghost-ciaft:-"Does not every tool of superstition carefully limit his apparitions to time, place, and person, to night, to a corner, to a coward ? Why are ghosts eternally ba nished from sunshine and a crowd ? What mighty causes restrain their stalking in daylight and in company ? If they are benevolent to mankind, why should they decline opportunities of at once securing indubitable testimony of their existence, of accepting that reverence their nature would attract, and that gratitude their kindness would excite ?'' The delusions of ghost-craft arise fron a variety of causes. Some of them are accidental and natural ; others are brought about by tnoibific agency, not a few by imposture; more by fear; and many by the wilfulness of credulity in ghost-seers themselves. -Â¿Unsworth's Magazine.
