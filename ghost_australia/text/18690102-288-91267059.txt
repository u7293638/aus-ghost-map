A COLUMN FOB, THE NEW YE^ The following epigrams, selected from ancient and modern authors, will not be unacceptable for New Year's Day, combining, as they do, wit, wisdom, and amusement : — TO AN IDLE SERVANT. You feed so fast, and move so very slow : Eat with your legs, and with your grinders go. Lucillius. BY THE SAKE : ON A MISER. A miser traversing his house, Espied (unusual there) a mouse ; And thus his uninvited guest, Briskly inquisitive, addressed : — ' Tell me, my dear, to what cause is it I owe this unexpected visit ?' The mouse her host obliquely eyed, And, smiling, pleasantly replied — ' Fear not, good fellow, for your hoard, I came to lodge, and not to.board.' Translated by Cowper. . Martial was a great Latin epigrammatist : — The golden hair that Galla wears Is hers : who would have thought it ? She swears 'tis hers ; and true she swears, For I know where she bought it. a. aoctor laieiy was a capwu maae. Tis but a change of title, not of trade. Ben Jonson thus apostrophises Martial's ghost:— Martial : thou gav'st far nobler epigrams To thy Domitian than I to my James ; But in my royal subject I pass thee. Thou flatter'dst thine; mine cannot flat tered be. In imitation of one of Martial's epigrams, Goldsmith in his epigrammatic poem entitled 'Retaliation,' thus hits off the medley of uamcK s temper : — Our Garrick's a salad, for in him we see Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree. Aosonius was another Latin author who pio dnced some good epigrams. Here is one : — ON A BEAUTIFUL BOY. Nature doubting made her plan, Doubting whether girl or man : . Doubting still her work I scan Almost girl and almost man. England has produced epigrammatists in almost all ages. Our author selects several ex amples : — ON DRINKING HEALTHS. 'I drink to thee, Tom.' 'Nay, thou drink : est from me, John. For when thou drinkest to me, drink thou leavest none.' N A CORPORATION ADDRESS TO QUEEN ELIZA BETH ON THE DESTRUCTION OP THE SPANISH ARMADA. As a west country Mayor, with formal ad dress, Was making his speech to the haughty Queen Bess, spleen, Has presumed to attach you, a poor virgin Queen, But your Majesty's courage has made it ap pear . That the Don had ta'en the wrong sow by the ear.' The two preceding were by J. Hey wood, about 1550. Lord Harrington, in the time of James L wrote the next two : — Treason doth never prosper, what's 'the reason? Why, if it prosper none then call it 'treason.' A lord that purposed for his more avail, To fence around a common with a rail, Was reckoning with his friends about the cost, And charge of every rail and every post But one, who wished his greedy humor crist, Said, 'Sir, r provide your posts, and without failing, Your neighbors round about will find you ' railing.' Dryden's world- wide epigram on Milton is of course known to all our readers, but it may be quoted as one of the most perfect examples of this kind of writing extant — Three poets in three distant ages born Greece, Italy, and England did adorn, The first in loftiness of thought surpassed, The next in majesty ; in both the last. The force of Nature could no further go, To make a third she joined the other two. The Earl of Rochester was a great _ wit. Amongst other epigrams attributed to him is the following, written on the bedeoom door of King Charles IL :— ? ' Here lies our Sovereign Lord the King, Whose word no man relies on, Who never says a foolish thing, Nor ever does a wise one.' It is said that the King, on discovering the foregoing, wrote underneath — 'The reason is obvious ; my words are my own, my actions are my ministers.'' Rochester is credited with the following, written on overhearing a dispute between. Dr. j&aacime;, a paysician, ana oir vxoairey xmeiier, the painter : — Sir Godfrey and Radcliffe had one common way Into one common garden, and each had. a key, Qioth Kueller, 'Pll certainly stop up that door, If ever I find it unlocked any more.' ' Your threats,' replies Radcliffe, '* disturb not my ease, And— so you don't paint it— why do as you please;' 'You're smart,5? rejoined Kneller, 'but say what you will, . ' -Pll take anything from you, but potion or pill.' The subjoined, is not a bad. example of Rochester's epigrams : — AGAINST INCLOS&RES.; Tis bad enough in man or woman, To steal a goose froin off a common ; But surely he's without excuse, Who steals the common from the goose. Pope was a great epigrammatist ; in fact some of his poetic works are chains of epigrams. He seems to have been verv hard upon Colley Cibber, Poet Laureate of his day, as witness the following : — In merry Old England, it once was a rule, For the King to employ both a poet and fool ; But now we're so frugal (Pd have you to know it) ' ? That a ?' Laureate' will serve both for fool sad. for poet. Colley Cibber retorting that every poet was a fool, Pope thus returned to the charge — Sir, I admit your general rule, That every poet is a fool; But you yourself may serve to show it, That every fool is not a poet. The following couplet was written on a pane of glass by Pope, at the request of Earl Chester field (Lord Stanhope), who lent the poet his diamond pencil for the purpose : — Accept a miracle, instead of wit ; See two dull lines by Stanhope's pencil writ ! To represent the production of 'two dull lines by Stanhope's pencil' as 'a miracle' waa a very happy and graceful impromptu. The epigrauiB by Dean Swift are both nume rous and often very excellent. The following are good : — 'Said Celia to a reverend dean — ' What reason can be given, Since marriage is a holy thing, That they have none in Heaven ?' ' They have,' says he, ' no women there;' She quick returns the jest — ' Women they have, but I'm afraid They cannot find a priest.' Swift's bookseller once greatly annoyed the Dean by tolling him that Ms books would not sell, and in the end the reverend wit struck the bookseller in the mouth, loosening some of his teeth. Subsequently the Dean thus 'apolo- gised': — I must confess that I was somewhat warm, I loosed his teeth ; but where's the mighty harm? My books, he said, would ne'er afford him meat, And teeth are useless when there's nougkt to eat! The; Dean wrote the following mock epitaph on a member of the Kildare family : — Who killed Kildare? who dared Kildare to kfll? Death killed Kildare, who dare kill whom he wilL Here's an epitaph on a Coroner who hanged himself : — He lived and died By suicide ! The following is by Porson, on a Fellow of Trinity College :— Here lies a Doctor of Divinity, Who was a Fellow, too, of Trinity. : He knew as much about Divinity As other Fellows do of Trinity. A good epigram, by Clarke (?), was written on seeing the words Domus Ultima (his ' last house'), inscribed on the vault of the Dukes of Richmond, in Chichester Cathedral : — ' Did he who thus inscribed the wall, Not read, or not believe, St. Paul, Who says there is— where'er it stands — Another house ' notmade with hands,' Or may we gather from these words, That house is^not a House of Lords ?' Breadstuffs people may be warned by the next, written by Dr. Byrom -; — Two millers thin, Named ' Bone' and ' Skin,' Would starve the town or near it ; But be it known To Skin and Bone - That Flesh and Blood won't bear it. The following is anonymous : — The toast of each Briton in war's dread alarms. O'er bottle or bowl, is 'Success to our arms j' Attacked,, put to flight, and soon freed from each trench, 'Success to our legs,' is the toast of the French. Dr. Doddridge, being twitted with the ex ceedingly jovial character of his family motto (Dum vivimus vivamus), wrote the following fine epigram upon the words : — ' ' Live while you live,' the epicure would Bay, ' And seize the pleasures of the present day.' 'Live while you live,' the sacred preacher cries; ' And give to God each moment as it flies.' Lord, in my view let both united be ; I live in pleasure whilst I live to Thee. Some of Garrick's epigrams are very pungent. On one occasion, in company, Oliver Goldsmith askod Garrick to compose an epitaph for him, -which, to Goldsmith's infinite annoyance, was thus improvised in a moment : — ' Here lies Nolly Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll; He wrote like an angel, but talked like poor PplL' In Garrick's time a fashionable physician — Dr. Tfiii — having written various squibs which annoyed the Literary Club to which Garrick, Johnson, Burke, and others belonged, some capital epigrams were calculated, chiefly at the expense oi.meuicai men. uoe 01 ur. nin a farces was thus hit off by Garrick : — For physic and farces his equal there scarce is ; His farces are physic, his physic a farce is. Some one having suggested as a punishment for Dr. Hill that he should 'Take his own physic and read his own 'rhymes,' the idea was thus improved upon : — The wish should be in form reversed, To suit the Doctor's crimes ; For if he takes his physic first Hell never read his rhymes. About the same time the- following was circu lated :- ON DOCTOR J. LETTSOM. If anybody comes to I, If after that they like to die, Why, what care II— I. Zetts'em. Peter Pindar was advised by Dr. Geach to take asses' milk, the doctor stating that it had been of great benefit to himself. The poet thus replied: — And, doctor, do you really think That asses' milk X ought to drink? 'Twould quite remove my cough you say, . And drive all old complaints away. It cured yourself ? Well, granted true, But, then — 'twas mother's milk to you I AN APRH, FOOL. ' This,' Hichard says, 'is April day, And though' so migthy wise you be, A bet — whate'er you like, 111 lay, Ere night 111 make a fool of thee.' 'A fool. I may be, it is true ; ? But Dick,' says Tom, ' don't be afraid, No man can make a fool of you, For you're a fool already made.' The next is an old. acquaintance, but w°. quote it because of the clever turn — not so well known — which is afterwards given to it : — ON 'WOMAN'S WILL. That man's a fool who tries by art and skill To stem the torrent of a woman's will, For if she will, she will, you may depend on't, And if she won't, she won't ; and there's an end on't. Cleverly inverted, of courseiby a lady : — ON man's will. That woman's wrong who tries by force or skill To stop the torrent of a man's self will ; For if he says he won't— he will, depend on't, And if he says he will — he 'won't ; and there's an end on't. - The Royal Marriage Act of 1772 caused many ajeu -f esprit, of which this is not bad : — Quoth Dick to Tom :' this Act appears Absurd, a Fm alive ; To take the Crown at eighteen years The wife at twenty-five .1 The mystery who can explain ? For sure, as well twas said, Thns early— if they're fit to reign They must be fit to wed. Quoth Tom to Dick, thou art a fool And little knows't of life ; Alas, 'tis easier far to rule A kingdom than a wife ! ON TWO CONTRACTORS FOB BUM AND GRAIN. To rob the public two contractors come — One cheats in corn, the other chests iu rumj Which is the greater rogue ? ye wits explain — A rogue in spirit or a rogue in grain? ON A GAMBLES. ' To fortune I but little owe,' A losing gamester cried ; ' Be thankful,' then, for all must know You owe enough beside.' Robert Burns has left a few epigrams from which we select the following : — IRISH WET. A Pat, an old joker, and Yankee, more sly, Once riding together a gallows passed by ; Says the Yankee to Pat, If I don't make too free, ' Give the gallows its due, and pray where would yorrbe?' ' Why, honey,' says Pat, ' faith it's easily known, ~ Td be riding to town by meeself, all alone.' TO A DRAMATIST. Your comedy I've read, my friend, And like the half you pilfered best; But sure the drama you might mend. Take courage man, and — steal the rest. When the Corporation of London presented the freedom of the city to Admiral K6ppel in a casket of heart of oak, and to Admiral Rodney in a gold box, the following rather cuttine epigram appeared : — Each admiral's defective part Satiric cits, your'e told ; The cautious Keppel wanted heart The gallant Rodneyrrgpld. . The French excel in epigrams. The great French lawyer Tiraqueau wrote a hook every year, and every year his wife presented him with a baby, until — it is said — the number amounted to 30. Many jokes passed at his ex pense, of which the following is a sample : — Tiraquellus and his wife, Yieing in a genial strife, Every year as sure as may be Give the world a book and baby ; Any he^Jbr^ productions?
