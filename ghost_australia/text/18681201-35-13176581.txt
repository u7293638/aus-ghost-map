CONSECRATION OF ST. ANDREW'S CATHEDRAL. Yesterday morning, in the presence of a very great concourse of persons, the Anglican Cathedral of St. Andrew, in this city, was consecrated according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England by the Metro- politan Bishop (the Right Rev. Dr Frederick Barker), who wes assisted by the Suffragen Prelates - the Bishops of Adelaide, Mellourne, Newcastle, Brisbane, Goul- burn, and Tasmania-together with the Dean of Sydney, Canons Vidal, Stack, King, and O'Reilly, and a large body of clergymen. This fine building has, therefore, after a lapse of many tedious years, at length been opened for the performance of Divine service, in conformity with the use of the Church of England. Having already laid before our readers some few particulars in respect of the history of this remarkable structure and a general description of the entire edifice, we shall now, without further preface, give a brief and com- prehensive account of all the proceedings having reference to tbo consecration of this church, which took place yester- day, being St Andrew's Day At half past 10 o clock the Metropolitan and his six Suffragen bishops began to assemble in the temporary building on the north side of the cathedral, where they were joined by about seventy clergymen. Thence the prelates (in their episcopal habits) with their clergy (vested in hoods, stoles, and surplices) walked in procession across the enclosure on the north of tho church to the Great Western entrance, where they were met, at about five minutes to 11 o clock, by the Very Rev Dean Cowper, with other members of tho Chapter of the Cathedral 'lhere the Dean, on behalf of the Chapter, presented to the Metropolitan the formal petition for the consecration of the Cathedral Church of St Andrew, and the document was read aloud by Mr Barker, the regis- trar of the diocese. The Metropolitan Bishop intimated that it was his intention to comply with the prayer of the petition, whereupon the Dean and Chapter having joined in tho procession, the Metropolitan (followed by the other Bishops and clergy in attendance), proceeded up the middle aisle to the altar, repeating alternately the 24th Psalm (Domini est terra) The Bishops having taken their places within the Communion Rails the sentence of con secration was read by the Chancellor and signed by the Metropolitan. The document was handed to the Registrar to be registered, vi Inch being dono it vvaB returned by thit officer to the Bishop, and bj bim laid upon tho Communion Table Then the Metropolitan Btandmg on tho north sido of tho Lord s labio timed to lho congiegalitn and said -"Deorlj beloved in the Lord, forasmuch as dovout ond holj men, us well under the Law as under tho Gospel, moved cither by the Eccict inspiration of tho Holy Ghost, or by tho ejiprcss command ot God or bj their own reason and sense of ordei and decencj, have erected houses for tho publie woiship of God, and scp ir ited them from all prefino and common usis, which godlv practico hath a manifest tendency to fill men s mincis with a blooming roverenco to thr Divino Majestj, and to affect their hearts with devotion and humihtj in the sei vico ot God let us mimbi j hopo that oui Heavenly lather will favourably approvo our present purpobe of setting apart this pi ice in solemn man- ner for the performiinco of tho several olhces of religious worship, and let us faithfully and dovoutlj beg His ^blessing on this our undertaking lhen followed tho Lord s Praver, in which the wholo con tregution (consisting of between threo and four thousand persons) |oincd , and next, wis satd tho prayer "0, Eternal God, after which tho Metropolitan repeated tho six cc lleets having special reforenco to tho future ministrations of the Chinch in that building, imploring Divino blessing upon tbo same Ibe morning service then commenced, tho Proper Psalms being tbo 84th, the 122nd, and the 132nd lho Tirst Les- son was taken from tho eighth chapter of tho Tirst Book of Kings fr m the 22nd to tho 62nd verse Ibis lesson was read bj tho \ erj Rev tho Dean of Sjdnoj 1 he Second Lesson (tauen from the fourth chapter of tho Gospel of St Luke, from the 14th to the 21st verso) was read hythe Rev Canon Stack Hero, and m the subsequent service, the collect used was that of St Andrews Da j, with a special prajer foi tho occasion In tho Ante communion service tho openingnrajera wero read by Dr Short, tho Bishop of Adelmdo Dr 1 hollian, the Bishop of Goulburn, reid tho Lpistle tho Gospel being read by Dr Pcrrj, tho Bishop of Melbourne In this service, as in the Order for Morning Prajer, there w ei o soveral special prayers for tho occasion ono after tho Collect for the Queen, and ono after tho Prajer for tho Church Militant Tho first anthem (in the Morning Proj er) was the 1st, 2nd, and 4th v erses of the 81th Psalm, Quern Dilecta-(Richardson) lho first hjmn vi as, " Christ is mado tho sureToundation -(St Werburgh) and the second, that before the sermon, was tho wcllknown bj inn beginning with these words-"Jesus calls us o cr the tumult,' i.c -(Batti) In consequenco of tho length ol the soi vico there was no voluntarj Tho preces and responses weie lalhs, and the Vernie, that by Philip Haves 1 he chants of tho Piopcr Psalms wero by Hine, W Hayes, and D Purcoll lho Te Deum, Gregorian, fifth tone, 2nd ending, and seventh tono, 1st ending lho Kyi íes in tho ante communion seivico wero by Naror, ml, and the chant for tho Niceno Creed, by John Goss Tho Sentences at tho Offertory faverj large ono) wore read by Dr Tuflnell the Bishop of Brisbane , and tho Prayor for the Church Militant was said by Dr Brombj, tho Bishop of 1 osmania The METUOVOLITAN then preached a Sermon, of which the leillowing is our report: Text : Matthew iv\, 19, " Eollow me, and I will mako you fishers of men." 1 These words contain the first command givoti by Our LoTd to his chosen disciplos, and also convej' a premiso to the Chuich in all ages. They aro connected with that direction and encouragement which it pleased their Divino ¡ Haider to give to his disciples before his departure When charging them to " preach tho Gospel to every creature," ho assured them of His pretence to tho end of timo-" Lo, ' I nm with you alwey, even unto tho end of the world." This day, at this distance of time, and in this remoto por- tion of tho earth, wo aro endeavouring to obey tho samo command. , In tbo special work of this day wo follow tho steps of those who have followed tho Lord. Wo oro iulfilling tho commission once given to the Church ty its Divine Head, und may humbly trust that wo shall bo favoured with His presence ;-that in tho con- secration of this cathedral, and in all tho blessings whioh will flow from this following of the custom of our fathers, Ho will be present with us, and with ours, to tho end of time. Moj' He be graciously pleased to hoar tho dovout prayers of His Church, and to accept that which wo now oiler to Him for His service] May his Holy Spirit novcr bo w ithdrawn from this house of praj-er, but sanctify the ordinances thereof unto tho edification, tho consolation, and the salvation of many souls ! lho command in my liixt is a summary of tho Christian religion. It is binding upon every man to follow Christ. Obedience to this command has two parts. He renounces the Fervico of other masters who follows tho Redeemer. Another is ready to claim him. " Tho god of this world " spreads his nets" and sets his snares, that ho may tako him captivo athis will. All are not, indeed, called to bo apostles, noris, it required of Christ's followers inovorycaso to forsake houses and lands, or to sell all and gi voto the poor, in order io follow their Muster. But, a following of him there must be : and, in order to this, not only "the lust of tho llesh, and tho lust of tho eyes, and tho pride of lito" must be mortified and subdued, but caro must bo taken that tho necessBiy pursuits and lawful occupations of life do not become hindrances in tho way of obcdienco to Christ and his command. We maj- observo then that they follow Christ who hear hib voice with a glad and willing mind-"My sheep hear My voice und I know* them, and thoy follow Me." The voice of Jesus is heard in secret. Tho still small voice of conscience, quickened by tho spirit, enlightened by the Word, is His voice. They, ngain, who would follow Christ aro seen by Him in the closot-" tho world shut out ; " or under tho fig tree, praying to an utEccn yet personal and omniscient Saviour. To such he is rot bilent. A voice is heard, saying " This is the way, wnlk yo in it." Aguhvthe voico of Jesus is uttered distinctly in his Woid. Tho Bible I'B tho Word of the living God-tho divine revelation of the will of Him of whom tho Incarnate Word was tho living manifestation, and a deop and reverenliiil regard to that Word is duo from ovory man. It was so when Elijah heard it and " wrapped his faco in his mantle, and went out and stood in tho entering in of the cave, and behold there carno a voico unto him." It is to this submissive und reverential spirit that tho promises of Divino guidanco ore made-" tho meek will Ho guido in judgment, and the meek will Ho teach his wa j*." l'urfhor, thoy follow tho Saviour who commit themselves to Him foi-' all Ho has to give ; and of His gifts tho first und best is Himself, as Lord and Christ-" a Saviour which is ChriBt tho Lord.*' When the Baptist bore witness to Him as " tho Lamb of God, which taketh away tho sin of tho woild," IIÍB two disciples who heard him speak found what they had been seeking, and " fol- lowed Jesus." And ngain, " One of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. Ho first findoth his own brother Simon and saith unto him. Wo have found tho Messias, which is. being interpreted, the Christ ; and ho brought him to Jesus." And still it comes to pass, that when men aro burthened with the heavy load of their sins and desire to seo tho sal .vation of God, they turn at the gracious invitation of Him who " Epako as never man spake"-" Como unto mo all yo, that labour and arc heavj' laden, and I will give you rest." They take upon themselves His joke and leam of Him, the meei and lowly One, and thus find rest to their souls. And in this lest there is a returning to Him. In this lovo.to Him thoy follow Him who has redeemed their lives from destruction. They oro mw henceforth His, and can say "I am thj' servant; Ianithj' servant * * * thou has loosed my bonds." The love of Christ constraint h them. Imitation of Christ is their aim. Ihey walk in love as Christaiso loved thom and gave himself for them. The mind which was in Christ Jesus dwells in them. Like Him, they are ready for ovory ' good work. Thoy ure considemte and compassionate, holy and just, faithful to God and jealous for his law. They walk by the rule of the Scriptures, and in dependence upon tho ' teachings of the Holy Spirit. They live a lifo of faith in . a crut ¡lied Redeemer, 'ihey dio in humble confidenco that for Bis merit and righteousness' sake Ihey will bo accepted of the Euther in the great daj-, and, having thus oboj-ed tho Saviour's command, find his promise f ulfilled-" If any man. eervo mo, let him follow mo ; and where I am there shall . also .- ray servant be : if anj man servo mo, him will inj- Father honour." But this obcdienco, it may ho said, is due from every man. There is ' nothing in this following of tho Rcdeemor whioh belongs especially to an apostle, or to ono who by J his office is a fisher of mon ? Truo ; but it must be added i that no one can be ii successful fisher of men who has not follow ed, tho Saviour and is not ¡ninga life of obedience to him Eor though, m tho language of our own Articles, tbo effect of Christ's, own oidinanccs is not taken uwiiy bj thcunwoithinoss of ministers, vet the effect of auchun worthinesB upon the minds of the pcoplo is most m)unous Because of the sins ot Lil s sons, mon abl orrcd the < ficrmgs of the Lord lhcrcforo "tho sin of the young men wits great before the Lord " If, ns a heathen writer could saj, it » ncce sary for on orator's success that his hearer« should be c nvmced of Ins sincentj, much more is it requisito for the preacher of Christianity that bo should be known firmly to behove, und sluulcl be observed consistently to prietiso, the gre it doctrines and prcc- pta of hib faith Ho must follow Christ if ho would "catch men " The ami of the fishciman is to win his spoil from tho deep So, out of the depths of sm and ignoranco una miseij, it is lho spiritual fisherman's object to win souls to Christ But ho must do fins m Christ s vnj-" wo have- toiled all night and taken nothing, nevertheless, at thj word I will let down tho net " nt Christ a word, be it observed-other- wise lhere is ne hope ot success Except the Lord s word oi din ellon be followed, thej labour m v am, und spend their night (their cheerless life) m tho ininistrj without blessing lind without success lho causes of this want of success aro not far to seo A minisliy must bo lifeless, if the heart be not first given to Christ and his ivoik Unless the Spirit has touched tho conscience und iiiimmcd tho understanding, and kindled love fo God and man m tho heart, coldness and loimality will characteriEo tho work, and destroj »11 hopo of success Ihey then toil m vam who fear tho ince of man, and aro confoimed to this world Ibej toil in vain who lack the courage and confidence which spring irom the consciousness of God's presence und power Nor can thoy hope for success who aie actuated by a covetous spirit, or who will not exercise sell-dcmal, or who, whilu busily labouring in tho external work of tho Church, It tvo no timo for retirement and study, und prayer lheso defects cannot bo remedied by the hoDO of any outward advan- tages whatever In vam will tho claim to apostolical descent be urged, or appeal bo made to pi unitivo practico and scriptural order Nothing of this nature, however valuablo in itself, can bo substituted for the living, active, and intelligent/enl which seeks to win souls to Christ by Hit c,ruit ordinance of his appointment, the preached word -the irochimnton of tbo Gospel of tbo grace of God Ihat Gospel is to the spiritual fisherman tho net by which ho draw s souls to Christ Ho uses it as the Loi d has appointed, and at his command who said that repentance and remission of BIUB should be preached in his name among all nations Be uses it with jutienco and diligence, with dis- crimination and skill His lev o w canes not, his hopo faints not, and success, Jrcm nnio to lime, rewards his blessed toil An uphltetl baviour still dru wa mcu from, unbelief and sin to holiness and peace It mo j not bo out of place hero to ob«ene that by some 1 crsons the Gospel, as vi o understand tho Word, is slighted and disparaged , as if, so to speak, Us remedial powor vvero exhausted, and other modes of bringing men to tho faith muBt be adopted ' Somo require that tho revelation shall be deprived of whatever is ofT'Osive, others, that worship shall be rendered more attractive m order that an intelligent i n enlightened age mnj bo w on to believe it I do not th ink that tbeso modes have niiy success worthy of tho name, cr aro at all likely to bo successful boforo Him at whose command wo must let down tho net Wo have seen, indeed, to what thee requirements eventually lead Rationalism, for instance, deprives Christ s death of its atoning efficacy, ond takes fiom un the sentenco of eternal misery Rationalism would make heaven s doors wide enough to admit everj iorm of unbelief though con- demned bj the Bible, and would remit the idei ot eternal punishment to tbo regions of fublo and mj ih Ritualism, on the other hand, in its full development, would fain reconcile us to the unrcformed Church of Rome, and to doctnncs and practices which our Protostunt forefathers unhctitulinglj condemned as blasphemous fables and dan- gerous deceits It elevates a couiuicmorativo ordinance into a propitiatory sacrifice It makes tho pres bvter an atoning, interceding pricBt.

desired to take part therein were able to do so-that there was no confusion or over- crowding-that thi sei vices were conducted in: a manner upon which he mest cordially congratulated tho Precentor

which tho cathedral should bo itself tho visible typo , and ho hoped and trusted it would ever bo tho tvpe (Cheers ) He had been somewhat glad to read the statement mudo this morning, shewing that the building had not been ior fiffy}ears in course of erection lhere was, no doubt, pn attempt to build a cathedral mado forly-soven }ears ago, and there waa no doubt that this cathedral was not tho building which was then commenced, and thoroforo the time may be shortened by somo j cars In these long icriods, however, it did not much matter It did not mat- ter to us whether the timo was fort}-soven or fifty years During tho whole period in which tbo cathedral had been in course of erection there vvero other important works Icing carried on lhere was not a Bingle parish church in Sjdnej, with the exception of St James's, which had not been cither enlarged or reconstructed during that period (Cheers ) 1 he exception did not prov o much Somopcople had said St James s was ht for nothing but to bo pulled down and rebuilt again (Laughter ) With that honourablo exception in which the high backed powa did testify to tho innovations of modern times, tho churches of Sjdnoj had leen rebuilt during the timo the cathedral had boon pro- gressing (Cheers) And, no doubt, if the largo sums which, from time to time, had been expended on the cathe- dral hue! been m the possession of thoso who designed tho building, Ihey might have boen moro economically ex- pended But it was an important fact that this wora had been corned on, not so much out of realised capital (which was in the hands of gentlemen who wero absent from the colon}), as out of annual incomes derived from the resourcea of tbo colony itself (Cheers ) lhere was one person here whum ho certainly wished to congratulate, and that was tho architect, Mr Blacket (Chrcis) Mr Blacket, no doubt, hko all other public n en had i good deal to endure Ho was not exempt from cuticisui, and criticism was for public men n useful and salutoiy medicine But at any rato the effect of tho cathediol was exceedingly good, and tho defects of the cathedral wero very manifest-such us thoso narrow tran- se pts, which, however, wera not designed by Mr Blackett He would recommend those who visited it to adopt the custom of a friend of his, who would take a person through a gallery, and would point out every excollonco in ovcry picture, and ho thought that in tho cathedral detects might be passed over, and its advocates point with satis- faction to the general result which had been attained (Cheers ) He hoped ho might havo satisfied his Excellency 8 demand, though he did not trust himself to say more than simply to express his gratitude for tho cordial and liberal manner in which any designs in which tho Church was in- terested viere maintained by tho members of tho Church here (Cheers ) He had nev er had any reason to fear that nny ol jeet w hich could bear criticism, w ould f ail to recen o suxiport, and he felt that no object which ho over presented to the members of tho Church would fail to receivo support, because ho trusted ho never should bo induced to oller any- thing which would not claim fan investigation, and tend to the wall being of the Church (Cheers ) Ho bespoko for tho cAthtdral a candid and fair consideration of its present arrangements ihey hod been mudo after careful deliberation, and with a desire to nioet all oljections , and though it has not been possible to grant tho desires of every person ono must only sav that, in failing that, they had proved tho impossi- bility of its being done It vviU bo ii cathedral, a placo where multitudes might be collected together , and it vi ould answer the expectations of thoso who desired that it should be one of the means of grace by which God was honoured and souls wera sayed (Cheers ) lhe LISHOP oi ADELAIDE also responded to tho toast, and in doing so sind he should notpresumoto detain thora a moment after the full and ampio speech which had fallen from the lips of tho Metropolitan It was n t his fault-it was perhaps his misfortune -to bo tho oldest of the Suf- fragan bishops lhe fault he could not correct, the mis- fortune ho must bear as best he mi¿ht, and ho asked thoir attentun while he said a few words on the present occasion Ho would say, that it was neither the majesty of the cathedral, noi the splendour of this city w hich had brought bim to this place It was not a matter of tasto and feeling, buta sense ot his duty as a suffragan of this great province -which he hoped would soon havo double the number of sufirofeaH bishops thnt it now possessed (Cheers ) Ho 11 usted that this was the visible beginning of tho results to flow liom union m the Church as well as m tho Stato On such on occasion as the one s thoughts must bo serious, and when he caine to reflect upon the histirj of this place, and ef the little band who landed in the neighbouring bay-and when ho looked upon this eily around him, ho could not help thinking " What hath God wroughts ' Out of the crimo of Eng- land had been built tins mognificent city, with all the elements of prosperity and gre itness

the development of the Church which had been laid on such foundations, he felt the work had been accom rhshed, "not bj the wisdom of men but hy tho power of the Suint of God ' (Cheers ) Whether it was in that noble cathedral or in this noble assembly, wo witnessed what God had wrought He pointed out how the Church had progressed smco tho uitroduction of tho voluntary principio The laity was an integral part of the Church, and it was unmistakable to-daj, that the Queen und laity wero well represented in this society Iwentj }ears ago he found in his diocese five churches and ihreo clng}men serving m those churches, and now under the voluntary principle, despised and inefficient ns it was, tney hod thirty-five elergjmen, and as manj chuiches He did not mean to eaj that they would compare with some cf the churches m this city, but still they wore a proof of the pre gress which had been mado The bishops were met together to the second Conference of the Province of fevdncj, und they might thank God, and toko courage for tbo results of thut Conference Ho trusted they would give fuller express on to tho decisions ot tho first Conference Ho believed m the language of the prayer he had uç.ain and again read m the Uni ereity of Oxford, that «he Queen is supreme over «11 persons, and that that principle must be maintained (Chcois) Ho trusted ho had done nothing to impair it as a man who was willing to maintain the independence of tho Church in all things necessary (Cheers ) lho LOUD BIMIOI OI S-MWEV briefly proposod tho health of his Excellency Lord Belmore, which toast was
