THE PASSING OF "TOM." This heading has no political significance, but refers to a solemn ana a weighty task which devolved upon Mr, Commissioner ltussell pn Wednesday morning. He wa9 called upon to determine njerits of a case involving the destruction of a domes tic cat. The parties to the suit were James Laurdnce Burns, veterinary surgeon, of Eastwood, and K. Ziegler, an immediate neighbour. The cause of all the trouble was that the former owned a cat which was addicted to making djiily—not to men tion nightly—incursions into tie defend ant's grounds, much. to the detriment, it was said, of numerous pot- plants and sun dry canaries. Likewise this member of tbe feline tribe, whose tastes were evidently eoieurean, evinced a decided partiality for the fish which Mrf Ziegler so carefully hung in his back yard to smoke. Also it resem bled the cat immortalized in song, for, de spite many warnings to refprm and quit the premises, it habitually dame back. At last the patience of the defendant became exhausted, and be batted an ancient trap to catch the creature. The charm of what the information described as "strong-smel ling flesh" proved too much for pussy to resist, and he was soon made captive. De spite the popular theory tbat a cat has nine lives, this one mournfullv gave up the ghost, as the defendant put it, "in less than naif a minute." Plaintiff thereupon in stituted an action against the defendant claiming £4 for the loss of his pet, and de fendant oounterclaimed an eqUal sum for dnmage to his property. His Honor gave judgment for the plaintiff on the claim and for defendant on the counterclaim without costs.
