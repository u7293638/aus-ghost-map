AN MAIN'S TALE. (From Once a Week.) "My dear fellow," said I, as I passed my arm through my friends as we left Lady L-s ball together, " 1 dont like your dancing so much with that girl in blue " " That cerulean angel, you mean," said Jack, " but the fact is, you are jealous ' " It is not much use for a man who starts for India to-morrow to be jealous of any one he leaves behind, more especially if he has to make his fortune before he can keep a wife But there is no possible reason why you should not marry with that Blackmoor property of yours, and give ' hostages to fortune,' asBSith my Lord Bacon., only I hope you will not choose that little girl in blue " " "Well, I'm), here we are at the chambers, you shall give your reasons why a man should not marry a lady dressed in blue, over a pipe So long as she does not wear blue stockings to match, I can see anything to object to in it " Oh the bliss of an evening pipe with the friend of your heart' We found a snug bro burning, swept an ly some books and papers to the sofa, settled our tumblers at our elbows, and ourselves in roomy slippers and easy chairs, and were soon in a silent cloud-protected Olympus " Now," said my friend (having doubtless emerged from a dreamland tenanted by an hour in blue taffetas) '' what makes you abuse my partner of to night is I suppose I had no business to engross her for several dances, you will say, but her style of dancing suits me, and when a garcon means nothing serious, women don't mind being booked for several waltzes. I am not on eldest son, you know, and Mountchapcl did not show in the horizon all the evening' "I did not mean that," I replied, you can settle all that with her chaperone." Didn't you like her blue gauze, then?" he went on " Think of the blue vapours that loitered 'slowly drawn' round Mount Id x, man, in what goddesses were concealed behind them " Sweet creatures in blue are much the same to me as sweet things in pink, Jack. The only blue things I dislike are blue pills." And devils," added he " Is it he face you carp at, or her figure, or her eyes, or what ? ' ' Now you have it : I can't stand her eyes " " not stand her eyes?" he exclaimed in astonishment, puffing out volumes of smoke I don't much wonder at that f r I am sure I cannot But they are heavens own blue, and in their depths-" and then he clasped his hands and went into a silent ecstacy as is the wont of lovers " W ell," said I, " you need not fancy in the green-eyed monster, for I am quite indifferent to their colour , but, seriously, I don t like their flesh " It does look a man through," replied the smitten Jack " I don't suppose you are very hard hit yet, or it would be no use my telling you she has madness in her " Good heavens, how can you tells Did you ever see her before Do you know anything of her family " " Not I. I never met her before to night, but it is little use a man going out to India, the land of madness, unless he bfls^tudicd mental disease, and the eve is the surest criterion of it I would not see a friend of mine marry that girl for a great deal " " My dear Tracy, you are far too solemn about it, who is going to marry her, in the first place and in the next, I am not such a blind believer in science as to think the eye the seat of reason, nor at so incredulous, as to deem all you tell money eye'" " It is really no laughing matter, I replied The 0}# is the mirror of the soul, it you can only read it lightly I am confident that the wild excited flash I noticed frequently in those deep violet eyes of that girl (themselves the very colour that bespeak immense imagination and enthusiasm) foreboded no good hereafter Eve to her, and you would raise a storm in a moment I have seen a woman of her temperament before now, in the hospital, make her teeth meet in the board at the head of her bed Give her a continuance of excitement, and cunning will lend its wiles to mona Hence arises the du best form of mental aberration -the calmness of marble extern div, the passions of a jury working within Such a woman must be ngovousU confined, or who will work a demon s mantelpiece "there linen, enough' he said, and we gladly) changed the topic, for I had spoken my mind, and Vi u walling enough to leave such a subject, more especially when re membered that it was our last night After a good deal of chat, and in a von thick atmosphere of smoke, 1 washed him farewell deep in the small horns, as an Englishman does, without any display of feeling, though we knew it would be at least a ten years pining "Good by old boy, I said, " send me a line now and then, and tell me when you wings are clipped " Good-by, my deal Tracy the quick ml kill ofToll the Nabobs. One last word of advice be sure you don't marry a Begum table'" Next morning the good ship Glendower here mellowing to an adopted country For fourteen years I ministered to on larged livers, and mingled in the gaiety of Indian life at a pleasant station Having left few friends behind me, I seldom heard much domestic intelligence from the old country You ought to have at least three sisters if you go to India,, no letters are so amusing, after all, is theirs One mail came wedding words indeed from the HOB John Francis Arden my old friend Jack and Mrs I. V Arden, me Julia Hamngton I wrote and congratulated him dumb Then the mutiny burst like a meteor on the country, I was besieged in a compound at Ii-uithahaadful of Europeans The Sepoys battered at us from an entrenchment hastily thrown up five valued out and stopped it I saw a tall matinee in front, as I leapt through then lude embrasure and made it him with mv legal men blade It shivered on his wooden shield, he raised his silver, and next moment I should have been cut down, but see the blow fell cry out porter s had planted a shoal of bay OHets in his breast I rushed on, but a ball 1 ud me low, and when I recovered consciousness, I found the day our own, our compound relieved, and myself ordered all to England next man as the only chance for mv life. It was a dull foggy November evening when I reached London To a man who has long been expatriated no solitude is greater than Bond-street, it was with the greatest joy therefore that I fell in with Arden two or three days after my arrival He was now in Parliament, and every glutton of statistics It was soon settled that after I had finished my business in town I should VIM. him at Blackpool A few days afterwards I was whirled along the North Western to Devonshire Waking, with its melancholy gravestones, looking like so many garden pegs stuck in a parterre as von hum past, was left behind, the vastest Pond was closed, soon the dreary country of Temple combe and Melbourne Court when eula hits there, that train-, should stop in that wilderness Then we had a gins! c of Lord Abbey, another nap, and I awoke to find myself living through the older orchards and valleys round Honiton The Blackmoor carriage soon brought me to the Hill and I descended light and refreshed, like houses himself to the dining room It was not a large part, and that a particular silent partner, who was far more attentive to the entumcU than to your humble servant, -c I had leisure to contemplate MM Arden She was a very pretty blonde, rosy-cheeked, bright eyed and Binding at every word he uttered Jack was always a good-humoured fellow, I reflected here for once you see the husband mirrored in the wife, she could over be -snappish to that woman who looks the incarnation of cheerfulness We adjourned to the drawing-room Some one sang ' JDI tant i pulpits," I was leisurely chatting to Miss Arden, and thinking what a lucky fellow Jack was to marry such a pretty and sensible woman, when the final cadence seemed to touch a silent chord within me Joining the group round the piano, I found Miss Vandeleur at the instrument hats was an old flame, and we were speedily on the boot terms She was stooping with the Aw days, she told me. at Hilton Park Avvdry himself soon came up, and, seeing how matters stood, asked me over to look as the pheasants for a few days Jack had evidently forgotten all about our conversation on madness before I left home so many years ago, and I I could not quite ask him whether he manned the obnoxious lady I had inveighed against that evening Neither could I satisfy myself whotbcrMrs Arden wore that lady Every now and then I fancied a shade came over her usual serenity It might be an index of the terrible power slumbering within, or again I thought prosaically, it might be indigestion The Arden's drove me over to Milton, and I was soon head over ears in love with Kate Vandeleur I am not p( mg to inflict upon you our lovemaking, suffice it to say that in a week Kate and I were engaged I had not paid much attention to the pheasants, and, beyond fancying Mrs Awdry rather a shrew, had found no leisure for aught but the attention a man must pay to a pretty girl in a country house, particularly when he is engaged to her One evening in December, in the pleasant glow of the large drawing room, Kate and I were chatting at the piano, or livious of else than ourselves when she suddenly looked up and saw Mrs Awdry leave her work table and walk to the west window Kate jumped up and ran to her " My dear Mrs Awdry ' six fifty and we have not gone up stairs even ' What will your husband say r ' "jscvcrramdMiss Vandeleur, come here" *""?* The two stood together in the embrasure of the window, and I could not help admiring them from my snug seat at the fire They were about the same stature but how different in face' The faint lamp burning in the window amongst the camellias and cynics, flung its pale glow upon their countenances, and while Mrs Awdry was solemn and awe struck, with her flaxen hair gathered into a simple mass behind Koto was laughing furtively, and wreathed in smiles for my benefit, and her dark hair- and eyebrows stood out in strong relief against the mellow amber light ' Do you see those gloomy clouds away in the west, Miss Vandeleur ' " To be sure, Mrs Awdry, but how dark and chilly they are Shall I light your candle ' * Stop here, child, said Mrs Awdry, seizing Kate's arm earnestly, " do you bclievomomens and then she pointed to the dark background, while Kate, somewhat awe struck too, followed her glance A light radiance seemed floating in the west Soon a bright point struggling on through the sky, a moment more and the full moon burst out in all its splendour, and what seemed to be clouds proved to be mountains, down which a flood of soft light poured, showings a fair prospect of valley and hill, through which every now and then a roof glinted, or a torrent flashed down the precipice like a stream of silver Then a cloud veil drifted over the moon, and all again became obscure, "How very beautiful exclaimed Kate, and we were all silent for a moment Something seemed to have excited Mrs Awdry strangely, for she still held Kate and pointed to the west Well, I will light candles, said that young lady, and having done so joined me at the fireside A few minutes more and the gang at the top of the stairs roared its summons to dinner How I hate gongs ' They are detestable at dinner time, but who shall describe their horror in the morning You are in the calmest of dreams, a moment more and the Princess Camaralzanion will lay her hand in yours when room ' oh ' oh but rings that

on the whole race of goings from the little ones you see advertised to alarm burglars, to those full-blown monstrosities able to arouse a whole panel ' ' Dinner passed in a mood less merry than usual Mrs vu dry seemed very distraite Awdry himself, a man of rather obtuse perceptions, conversed with Mrs Arden on n magistrates business and shorthorns Making every allow ance for her weariness of these topics, who was listening to Jack, could see that his wife was ill at case about something else Mrs Awdry had some whim about leaving one of the dining room windows with the blind up and no shutters drawn It was just behind me and opposite Mrs Arden I glanced round and saw the moon riding apparent queen amongst the stars Then I looked at Jack's wife Her eyes wandered restlessly to the window, and then to Mrs Awdry but she said nothing When the womankind retired at the close of the evening, Jack and our entertainer withdrew to the gun room, situated at the other end of the house, for a cigar I felt unaccountably sleepy, and sought my room After winding my watch up and kicking off my shoes something drew me to the window I raised the blind and swept back the curtains It was very clear and star bt Just below a gravel walks shining between two dark lawns, hd or to the shrubberies An ominous sound flow every now and then over the moon ' A nice night for the poachers, I thought, when suddenly a woman flitted on the walk before the AA as it a woman, or could I be di earning No one certainly no women, had any business in the shi robbery I relief led, this bitter frosty night "i co there the toll slight figure, with some dusky cape on, was passing quickly before me Soon the gate of the shrubbery was opened and silently shut, and, whoever she was, the figure disappeared amongst the laurels I was on the point of dropping the blind and thinking if a lady's maid going to meet the young keeper for a few minutes chat when another female figure tall as the other, and also loosely wrapped in a grey shawl, came out from the house to the path She was evidently undecided what to do, as she paused and listened that instant the moon came brightly out from 0 cloud, and I saw it was Miss A Anderson s face, but pale and ten r stricken In a moment an awful fancy seized me The in ion s power lind drawn out Jack's wife, and Kate had followed but lost sight of her Mrs arden might do herself no harm boy and catching a cold or she might destroy herself, but what of Kate What if she were perceived by Mrs Arden and the latter, in her frenzy, were to turn upon her The idea was too awful I hastily flung on my cloak, rushed downstairs, and in the hall met Mrs Arden, calm and bright as ever She was habited just as when she left the drawing-room, and carried a candle and a book ' Mr Tracy' what is amiss You might have seen a ghost ' she said "I-I-I fancied I-Excuse my agitation Where is Miss A and clear ' ' Kate In her room, to be sure ' ' " Well, but I thought I saw her just now on the lawn By the bye added I, as a thought struck me, " where is Mrs Avvilrv "I have just been down to fetch her the second volume of Stolen Secrets But what is amiss with you. what has happened "Will you oblige me by taking up the book to Mrs Awdry, and then saying Good night to me from the upper landing I will tell you mv dreams in the morning, I added lightly After a good night's sleep, I hope, said she, had passed up stairs I paced impatiently up and down the nail till steps were heard above, and Mrs Awdry said of the, "Mv good Mr Tracy, dont terrify us poor women to death, but fro and from the men in the smoking room or else ring for Hastings to brm g you hot water, and have a sedative before you go up stall's' Good night' Mrs Barton also said Good night, and before I could rejoin they had both retired Was it a dream of mine, or had I seen two people outside Miss "V and clear I could not be mis- taken in at all events I would look out at the night I opened the door and passed on to the lawn There was a touch of frost in the mr and all was silent except the monotonous fall of water over a distant wheel Rapidly passing into the shrubbery where I had seen the figures disappear I looked up and down the long walks, but beyond the bare leafless aims of trees and many a dark shadow requesting the moonlit ground, I saw nothing Brushing through the laurels I vaulted the palms and found myself in the park Tow scenes are more lovely than an English park in the moonlight-the dark clumps of trees and ruminating cattle and Ivory grass shrouded by an Is hue and there are always engaging, but I had no time for an artistic glance "and then I was looking for a moving figure Hah ' there was something on that rise but now it had disappeared I ran to the block dashed through the mist and down into the glide in time to hear a shot or two and a fine li and fined a troop of terror a dozen others and all trotted off into the darkness "N with a laugh I retraced my steps and thinking all must have been a delusion which, as Mrs Awdry had suggested, would best be cured by a glass of brandy and water, resolved to punith Hastings for my nocturnal r table, and returned to ring him up soon I j ci ceived I had an died my way md as each turn I took round the "marked hawthorns only led me up one hill and down another glade shrouded in the same blue mist till all looked identical, I began to this; my adventures were not yet over I had never been in this part of the park before and, though I approached a large fir wood at the side did not like entering into it better be lost in an open park I reflected than plunge about in a dark wood, and perhaps fall into an old quain So I passed down the edge of it to an open ride I had entered this, when to my amusement the same figure I had seen from the window crossed it at right angles some way in front A moment more and the second figure followed I dished up thunder and gazed down the crops path it led into a thick haze that cut off oil further investigation of the mysterious won deeds and they were not in sight I listened and heard no football They are in the park ' I thought " I will secure them at once or at all events see the d none tent of all the" 1 anning my head howey ci I saw the house at the other end of the ark and a light in a small window that I conjectured must be the positive To reach this window and tap at it took me not a moment 's time I heard some one give a violent start, and then (he valiant Hastings col led out (to some imaginary ally, for no other man slept Ardova) "Thieves' mercy onus' thieves' here, John, hairs on blunderbuss, and take you the big carved' ' Hold your stupid noise Hastings I said, "ondeóme out quickly without saving a word to any one you will find the front door open I want you for a guide After a minute or two he appeared on the lawn with a dark lantern (that he had forgotten to light and a sword, is, if to attack poachers "Drop thee, I said, and come at once Two of the 1 idle" oiemthepaik and I fear the worst Wo burned on in silence down the one and through the haze to a height overlooking the park where we paused a moment Hastings was puffing like a grampus over what might be a tablecloth he were as a necktie He evidently thought mc light-headed, and began to wish he had kept his sword. I descended the long dip with intense eagerness It led down to the Exe and like a clear w late ribbon the river w and round this side of the domain I saw no signs of the ladies, and once more began to doubt my own faulty Turning to my guide I said, " Well, Hastings, did you hear anyone moving in the house before I knocked at the window I did, me, the gentleman are still in the gun room, but I heard some lady pass my door, and fancied I heard the drawing room window open But I had a good deal to do to the plate, and it doesn't do, you know, sir," he added meaningly, " to take any notice of one's fancies I was (going to blow him up for his cowardice, when I saw one of my phantoms passing quickly to the waterside, and the other following "Stay, Hastings, not a word ' Look there " "It is my lady and Miss Vandeleur, I think, sir," he said We were somewhat hidden, and stood rooted to the ground in utter amazement The first figure turned at the river's edge, and seeing Miss Vandeleur following, waited for her, we could see them parleying as it seemed, and then they walked along the side to a clump of low willows The moon was out bright at this time, so I could see distinct- by what occurred The first figure stepped into a boat under the trees, the other delayed ' Good heavens, sir! " said the butler, "runs There are no oars in her, and the last is only a hundred yards off below the willows I was off like a shot long before he had ended, and sped to the boat, but not in time to prevent both ladies getting in and rushing off into the stream' They saw me, and Mrs. Awdry, flinging the boat-hook into the water, stood up in the stern, while poor Kate cowered on the benches " Save me, Mr Tracy, she cried, " oh save us " "All right, my darling," I called , "lookout"' and was instantly in the water up to my knees, when, horror of horrors ' Mrs Awdry raised a knife that gleamed in the moonlight responsive to her own world eyes, and said coldly, sternly, and impassively, as she held it over Kate, "Come a foot nearer us and I strike ' We are going to have a new sensation to- night " I stood in utter despair, not daring to move, and the boat whirling round heavily swung off into deeper water past me, while Mrs Awdry stood dressed in white with her hair loose, and the gloaming knife over her head, like some fury bearing off poor K «te to destruction She was raving mad, I saw, and, awful as the situation was, I felt instinctively it was best to be quiet " Keep up, mv bravo Kate ' Wait a moment," I caBcd " and help is at hand " Mrs Awdry did not seem to heed this, but raised a wild snatch of Italian, Dolce Vendetta and glared now at the moon above, now at poor trembling Miss Vandeleur below As the boat moved into the centre oftener I ventured to emerge and run along the bank, keeping a vigilant watch on Mrs Awdry s movements Soon the boat ceased to whirl round, and shot steadily on, and I heard the increas- ing rush and roar of what had seemed from the lawn like a water-wheel, but was in reality a slasher or a backwater, where the Exe, swollen with the late floods of autumn, plunged madly over a stone worn into a sullen pool beyond, the danger thickened momentarily, and I dared not yet dash in Still the knife was glittering in Mrs Awdry s hand I made up my mind to wait a few seconds more and then leap in at all risks, even then I might only hope to tow the boat nearer the shore before it took the dread plunge and it was certain the knife would ful on poor Kate I turned instinctively to look for help, and a large stone was flung over my head, and fell with a heavy splash beside the boat Mrs Awdry started, and the knife dropped into the stream "Well done "Hastings'" I cried, as that functionary came panting up "Run to the top of the latter and be ready to help " " avow their late darling' I will save you yet' " As I plunged in, I saw Mrs Awdry cower down bes do hate, but the sudden cold and the rushing of the water in my cars gave me no more time than to use half bewildered to the surface and strike out wildly to the boat Swiftly, swiftly was I drawn on to it, the yawning lasher was but ten yards farther on and I saw the white leaping waters dance like so many friends in the moonlight A stroke more and I had my arms on the boats side calling to idly over the hiss and swirl below me Alas ' Kate had fainted, and ere I could turn the boat, we were swept over ' I sprang forward and clutched Kate s dress, and then was struck violently on the head by a post, and whirled round, blinded, and suffocated, and contused against the stones, and finally, after what seemed an age instead of an instant, lost my senses AA hen I came to myself I was lying on my back on the grass with my hand still firmly grasping Miss Vandeleur's dress Hastings and Jack were holding me, and the latter was dripping " Thanks, Jack, I feebly manured, and turned to look at Kate ' >o grip like a drowning man is said Jack ' But what on earth does all this means" The wan figure beside me was raised as I loosened my hold, and Hastings sped off for assistance "Good heavens'" said I, "it is Mrs Awdry ' ' In my hurry and confused state of mind I had seized Mrs Awdry and saved her instead of Kate "Oh, Jack, Jack'" I said piteously, where 13 Kate Lift me up let me go in again ' Save her, md never mind me He held me in a vice, and said, " 3 011 don t go in again, I can tell you But what in the world brought Miss Vandeleur hero too And in he plunged once more into the seething pool, darkness under the high pollards I jumped up, and man agony was crawling to the edge, when what seemed an utter drawing out a salmon on the other «ldeiesolved itself into Awdry, whose chest y voice soon sang out "Here she is, breathing yet, Tracy ' Come over the bridge just below, and I will cross to my wife " Out came Jack again dripping like a Newfoundland, and speedily led me over the bridge, where we found Miss Vandeleur senseless on the bank But then came a crowd of domestics, and doctors, and hot water bottles, and the two ladies were carried off to a neighbouring cottage In an hour poor Kate slowly revived, but Mrs Awdry never breathed again It was supposed that she had been struck against the stones with greater force than myself. As for Mrs Aiden, she knew nothing of what had occurred in the next morning Mrs Awdry had cleverly disarmed her fears, and sent her to bed When Kate could converse on that dreadful night, she informed us that she lost sight of Mrs Awdry in the park for some time, and it was plain that that lady had returned to lull all suspicion during which time she had said good night to me in the hall, and then descended to the park, where Kate, once more see- ing her, pursued her to the water's edge, and the sequel has been told Such is the cunning of madness, and with such tenable frenzy does it sometimes blaze out after many years' quiet, at the sight of something or somebody that revives old a sociations I need hardly say that Mr. Awdry had married the young lady dressed in blue, whose eyes had told the tale so readily on that long-distant evening of the ball at Lady L's, and perhaps it is still less needful to add, that six months after the tragedy of that eventful night at Milton Park, Miss A Anderson gave me the office of ministering to her sadly shaken nerves by a much dears title than that of your humble servant. M.D. PAINFUL SCENE t\ A CitRon On Sunday afternoon, while the Rev John Burton, incumbent of St Margaret s Episcopal Chapel, Meigle, was engaged in reading the service, a female, elegantly attired in a blue silk dress and fashionable bonnet, entered she church in an excited state, and, proceeding rapidly towards the leading desk where the rev. gentleman was officiating she threw a small cord over his head, and seizing the prayer-book, shut it by violently, exclaim- ing in a loud voice as she did so that she would not allow him to lead that book Mr Burton immediately descended and disengaging his head from the cord, again attempted to pass her, when a struggle ensued, and she again attempted to get hold of the prayer book The congregation, paralysed by the sudden- ness and extraordinary nature of this sacrilegious enters up ion of the solemn services in which they were engaged, made no attempt at first to interfere but at length some c* the gentlemen present left their new s, and succeeded, not without difficulty, in selecting from the chapel the unhappy originator of this painful scene Mr Burton then proceeded with the service, which was frequently interrupted by renewed attempts on the part of the intruder to be enter the chapel When the service was concluded, the reverend gentleman gave out the Evening Hymn, and intimated that, in consequence of what had occurred, he trusted to the sympathy of his head era for dispensing on that occasion with his usual sermon After singing the hymn the benedic- tion was pronounced, and the congregation dispersed to find outside the unhappy woman walking to and fro, still in a state of great excitement She proved to be a dressmaker hymns the neighbourhood, whose mind for a considerable time past has been in a very unsound state On more than one occasion before, by threaten- ing letters and otherwise, she has annoyed Mr Burton, and one of the poor young woman s hallucinations is to fancy herself the property of several of the estates in this district more than one of our resident gentry having received a formal notice from her to quit their possessions On the Sunday after noon she waste moved in the custody of a policeman to Perth, where the mental malady under which she Labours will doubtless receive every attention Dundee Ithotisei Pc\isiiMEt>T- i\ PERSIA.
