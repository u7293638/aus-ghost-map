Uuw reader's nro awaro. tliat tlio Board of General Education for Queensland is now defunct; but shortly before its de- miso it furnished to ,His Excelleuqy the. 'Governor its sixteenth annual report on .tlio condition of tho schools' throughout the colony. The document is" thereforo :a sort of last will and testament. It .is, for the past year, and is of more than usual interest. j Before proceeding with an analysis, it may bo an advantage to procure a fow detail pegs, and we find the follow ing ready to hand : Schools in operation, 203 in 1874, and 231 'in ,1875 — comprising: Vested schools, 127, 167; non-vested schools, 36, 28 : provisional schools, 40,t45 ; total increase, 40, 27. . Tonohcrs (including pupil teaolicrs), 690 in 1874, nnd 674 in 1875 ; aggregate attendance of scholars, 29,012, 33,643; nvorago attondauco, 16,045, 16,887.' Pnrlinmontnrj1 vote for education 'undor tho Board, £72,000 in 1874. nnd £87,200 in 1875 ; local subscriptions towards school-buildirigs, with interest, £3,116, £2,184 ; salaries and allowance's of officers, £4,296, £4,427 ; to touchers, £44,606, £65,810 ; buildings, furni ture, and repairs, £29,085, £19,S80 ; total ex penditure out of Parliamentary veto, £77,474, £81,135 ; out of local subscriptions, £2,638. £2,084. Those who dislike the pegs may skip them ; nevertheless they are most im portant. , Under the head of now schools, the report states that the in crease last year was considerable, though not so great as. during tho previous year. The schools opened, or taken undor tho Board's management) huih- hored 42, of which 30 wore vested, and 12 wero provisional. This shows that tho educational requirements of the colony are still rapidly increasing. The efforts of the Board to ostablish new schools, or to enlarge oxisting ones, appear to have been restricted during tbo year by tho smallness of tho amount available for tho T>urnosn. t.lin neemmta showing a retrenchment, as compared with tho previous year, of about £91,000. In 1874 the expenditure for all purposes exceeded that for 1873 by £32,000, or at the rate of about 66 per cent ; while in 1875, the expenditure oxcocded that for 1874 by only £3000', or at tlie rate of less than 4 per cent. An accompanying table shows that there are thirty provisional sohools on the way, and many of these, it is presumed, will pave the way for schools of a higher class.. ' Coming to another branch, wo learn that the average : attendance at the schools was much affected by the prevalence of sickness during ' several months of tho year; still, it was a littlo over 50 percent, of the aggregate, and it is assumed that not less thnn 25,000 children _ received substantial instruc tion, while the remaining 8000 whoso names appear .on tho books derived some advantage from tbo schools. Wo come next to tlio teaching staff, and it appears that now, as hitherto, good material in this lino is scarce. According'., to : tho report, 84 teachers and pupil teacliors were added to the staff during tho yoar, and tho increase would have been much larger if good teachers could have been secured. Seventeen classified toachovs arrived from tbo United. Kingdom, fifteen of them having obtained assisted passages. Twonty-one arriyod in 1874, And all wore soon busily At work, training tho young idea. "With, the oxception of female candidates for pupil teaohor- ships, and ino'xporienced persons do- siring appointments, there wore fow local applicants. The staff for tho yoar gives ono tenclior to 25 pupils in average attondunce, but this is not the proportion in all cases. Instances have occurred of ono toa.chor being required singlo-liandod, to control and instruct from 60 to 180 children ; besidos which, a considerable number of tho ontiro staff were ongagod only a portion of the year. It is ovidont that wo must have a constant stroani of toacliors; if ado- quato provision is to bo mado for now schools, for tho rapid increase of scho lars in both old and new, and for the gaps made in tho ranks oithor by ro- moval or doatli. Tho Board spoaks in tho highest., terms .of tho toachers, and section oloven of tho report cannot be made too promino nt. This being tho last occasion on whioh tho Board's opinion of tho tonohing staff of tho Primary Sohools of Queensland onn: bo oxpros- scd, its mombors desire to plaoo ori rooord thoir conviotiqn';. thiit ito.would bo diQlobltto! find a body of ' publio Borvnnts , possessing a higher bouso of, duty, arid disbbiirging that duty with more ability and oonsoiontiousncss than hnvo boon displuyod by tho Primary Sohool Toiiohors of tho colony. The report deals with several other Bubjeota-'-suoh ab the examination of toaohers and pupil toaohcra iii Jprq- motion, inspootion and trainihg'i abholdr-' ships, &q.;— upon which it is unnpeossary. here to ontor; but we may quote section twonty- twb, which says: — " As 'Tho Statute Education Act of 1875' comos into operation on tho 1st January, 1876, tho functions of tho Board now coaso. Its members desire, , how over, on relinquishing thoir ofiico, to express .their high opihioii of tho officibncy with which the Sooretary and the Inspectors, nnd tho other officers of the Department linvo discharged their respective dutios." with this valedictory address on its lips tho Board, on tho 31st Dccomber last at iniduight, yibldod up the ghost, full of years and honors. " Ring out ' tho old, ring in tho now." "With tho new year enmo a change, and wo havo now an Education Departinont,. with a Res ponsible Minister and an Undor Sooro- tury. Yoars bring digiiity, but also inoreasing cares, for in addition, to / tbo careful administration required bfor the Primary Schools, provision lias yet to bo mado for secondary education on a soalo commonsurato with tho require ments of tho colony. But tho satis factory basis upon which our system of primary instruction now rests must encourage .-tho friends of oducation to mako further efforts.
