Hey, Diddle, Diddle. Hey, diddle, diddle ! The cat and the fiddle, Are getting old-fashioned, I trow, More novel 'twould be for a great wallaby The organ to play with one toe. For the moon to give .chase to the man on her face, And the comet to join in the fun. For the evergreen rabbit to weep at the habit Of squatters infesting its run. For the novelist pale to yield up bis tale To fihe teeep of Bo peep's woeful verse. For the ghost of the corner to tit on Jack Horner White Coroner Cats seek a hearee. For small dogs to giggle when cows give a wriggle, That lands teem away past the moon, Is realty quite stale, as is also thn tale Of the dish mniring off with that spoon. Now, not to make off with a spoon when there's moon, Is a far more astonishing thing. And to see the moon wriggle — oh, hey diddle, diddle, In that case vou reallv mieht sin a. — B.T.
