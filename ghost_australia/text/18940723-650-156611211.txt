SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT PACE PARLIAMENT ? Undoubtedly yes, to put theiji PROGRAMME BEFORE THE COUNTRY. Considerable controversy is resulting on this question :? Should the Govern ment resign at onco, or meet Parliament ? An unbiassed consideration of the matter must provide this reply : They should face the House in order to put before tho country, through his Excellency's speech, the programme of the party. Of course, nothing would suit tho present Opposition better than that the Government- should resign with mute and most inglorious promptitude. If only thoy would do that the Party ivould be unheard, and their proposals remain without enunciation. This would suit the Calico-Jemmy brigade beautifully. An immediate resignation would bo tho gagged death of tho Government; and they owe it to the country to speak with Stentor's voice, even though they sur render their ghost tho moment after. What might have been is what will be ; and the Ministry must let the people into tho knowledge of it. Hi3 Excel lency's speech provides the opportunity. The opportunity must bo seized by our party* and not by the party who are opposed to them.
