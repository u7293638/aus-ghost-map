But Mr. Dalley's attack on Mr. Parked -a portion of it, at least,-was inll. nitely more discreditable.

Does Mr. Dalley think hirse'lf entitled ,to triumph over Mr. Parkes in the mat. tar pf the Kiama Ghost ? Thefb liaive 'als sys, doubtless, been a certain .iumn: number.of persons in Kiama by~whoio the shameless representations and false. hoods circulated in reference to this affair by himself and his set, have been readily and eagerly accepted : ud these we dare say were fairly represented among those who listened to him on this occasion, as he might very well' guess. But the facts of the cease are known in Kiama; and without earing whether these remarks are read beyond the area of our usual circnulation or not, we will bring them to the recollection of our readers. What did Mr. Parkes say on the cocasion which furnished. Measrs. Dalley and Co. with the grounds for so much wretched caricature and so much soandalous falsehood ? Simply this, that in his bilief the attempt on the life of the Duke of Edinburgh was 'the 6e. s~uit of a oonspirady. .,We a're not c.bo-i cerned to vindicate Mr. Parkes's veracity:, butwe maintain that it was and is,,in theavery nature of things, more probiable than not thiat thereowas a conspiracy It there are Any'a?iong our readers who (to go no further), vere'in the habit of glancing through the Freeman's 'Jour-' nal during a number of years before the orime in question wgsipsrpptrated;.they pill probably agree that suchb a conspi" racy.-among those who were: habitually influenced by-that- journal, was compa. r.atively a small thing to expect or to credit, Mr. Parkea, then Colonial So orotary, having said what we have men?. tioued, his,, words were straightway ridiculed, denied, diatorted, exaggerated by his particular enemies, and by those who wished to curry fiavour with that section of the population tp.which Mr. Dailey belongs. Mr. Dailey was be. lieved at that time, and no doubt cor; really, to have much to do with the conduct of the 'Sydney Panelsh ;' and h' does nst hesitate 'to boast of his nc. qgtainttnce with matters concorning de. mcons, witbches, ghosts, and the like. Accordingly, there forthwith appeared in Punoed' a cartoon reprpsouting M1;. Parkees aisa wicked magso:q,.oonjurmng up abhorrible ap[arition bo p an ati. dience in which the people of Kiama were represented bfi; number of"'spty skulls," Of onurse, it now suits' 'AMr. Dalley to speak in, somewhat different terms of pearsnns.whom he wishes to be. lieve favourable to himself and -hie colleagues. But it is anot surprisingthmat he should still feel sore on the subject of the conspiracy; far he cannot fil to remember how, when the matter became a subject of parliamentary'inquiry, the result, so far as the verdict of the As. sonibly end the publio was concernedd, oexhibited the so.to omp.ettduiiphi:;for Mr. Parkes, and unbounded humilation thfr Measrs. Dalley; Maaleiy aid Co,. We 'never thought to recaur to'th'e~se matters again, though we' mike no tafoantation of wishing toforgot' them. But the brazen complaceuoy and the in' ferontial falsehood which chairaaterised Mr. - Dalley's - s'peol, make it im pocsiblo to avoid the topic. Mr. Parkes has since that time been guillty' of follies enough, which, if public dinnere muist be made thesoeue of poli. ticael wrangling, were fair game for Mr,. Dalley. The Attorney.Geuneral thinks that ghostly politicins .oo'ming out' of their graves to sow dissension,. &c;,.
