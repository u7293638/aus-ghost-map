The Publicans' Purse fell to Claret, an aged gelding, carrying Ost. j Mcrryjig, a four-year-old, with 7st. 7lb. up being second. On the following day the Steward's' Purse was won by Stag, Kate Kearney second, and rat-trap third, but the local papers give no' record of the weights carried. For the Town Plate there was a splendid race, Mcrryjig, 4 years, 7st. 71k, being first rat-trap, Oat. Sis., second and Claret, 8st., third. rat-trap, the game little son of The Italian, was only beaten by half length. At Mitchell, the Maiden Plate was won by Harkaway, 5 years, Petrel and Czarina, both aged, being second and third. In the Flying Handicap, Benjamin, an aged horse, carrying 8st. 10lb., beat the well-known Orphan Boy, the latter carrying 8st. 4lb. The New Year's Day Handicap fell to Petrel, aged, 9st. Hb.; King of the King, 8st. 12lb., being second; and Harkaway 7st. 12 lb. (12lb. overweight), third. Orphan Boy also started. The Farewell Handicap was won by King of the King, Orphan Boy being second. For this there were seven starters. . There was rather a phenomenal performance at Charleville on Boxing Day, Little Nell winning the Maiden Plate, Publicans' Purse, and forced Handicap, and running second for the principal handicap, which was won by Little King. Liberator, by Westminster, won the Stockman's Plate. At Tattersall's Meeting in Sydney. on New Year's Day lillington, with 7st. (4lb. up, won the Flying Handicap, six furlongs, boating Orator, I! years, 9st. 10lb., Hon. J. White's Mascotte, 4 years, "it. Jib., and a big field, in clearing Venetia, Sit. 2lb., and Eagle Grange, 7s!.. Tom Brown, the favourite for TsUcr sall's Cup, showed that the confidence reposed in him was not misplaced, for he won a good race by half-a-length, doing the two miles in 3min. 3(ยก.}aec. The time was good, but the winner only carried for. 5lb. He was ridden by Donald Nicholson. The weights for the Anniversary Handicap at the Sydney Turf Club Meeting are published. It will be seen that Ellington carries 7st. '4lb., and Aclaiiinnlea is not in with the very light impost of list. 5lb. The distances mile and three furlongs-is rather short for Sir. Mooney's pNcky nnue. The annual meeting of the Victorian Club on Saturday night showed that in Melbourne racing is not only very popular, but that it takes a lot of it to surfeit the public. Madcap, the winner of the Summer Cup at the Amateur Meeting, landed the Victorian Gold Cup, with 8st. up, the placed horses being Agatha (9st. 8lb., and Amoljii Victoria Cut. 3lb. It is rumoured in town that Mr. P. K. RICardo, the secretary of the Queensland Turf Club, intends to resign at an early date. He has unfortunately held office during a period when racing in this part of the colony has been in a very depressed state. The Glen Innes Jockey Club meeting is to be held on the 17th and 18th of March next. The programme contains a novel feature in the Great Sovereign Handicap of 500 sovs., the winner of which is to be sold immediately after the race for ยฃ1. The nomina- | tion for this event has sovs., acceptance 7 sovs., and final payment (i sovs.; in all, Kiaovs. has to be paid by starters. The other principal races are the Glen Innes Cup, a sweepstakes of 3 sovs. each for starters, with 200 sovs. added ; second horse to receive ยฃ20, and third horse ยฃ10, from the past and the Stuart Plate of ยฃ100, with a sweepstakes of 'J sovs. from starters, second horse to receive 20 from the prize. The adjourned Peak Downs race meeting came off' on New Year's Day. The Messrs. H. al field's horse Magus won the Christmas Handicap with ridiculous ease, beating Marquis and Wellington. Lurline secured the Maiden Plate easily from Newton and Peeping Tom and Marquis took the Wind-up Handicap altern good race with that fine little more Priiiny. Some of the Sydney papers appear by no means pleased with the recent running of Inglesides, or, more properly speaking, with the riding of Jenkins. "Nemo," in Ihcbijdneyilhtil, one of the best sport big authorities in Australia, says : " The Queensland crack, Inglesides, ran in a seemingly extraordinary manner, in the first place, although he had 12st. up, his cut out the running till seven furlongs from home and in the second, when looking as dangerous as anything, when the distance was reached no apparent effort could be seen on the part of his rider to help him to win, Ingle- sides is just about the most perfect hurdle horse that ever stripped at Randwick, and a very different result was certainly expected. True, the horse stone fence very hard, and removed the skin from his near fetlock joint, but that need not have prevented his being ridden out." Another of the papers states that Jenkins should have been called upon to explain his conduct in not making an effort to help his horse when the tug of war came. The Casuistry colt - the English Derby favourite has been named Paradox, and when the last mail left he was being backed at 7 to 1 for the Derby. This little piece of gossip is from a Melbourne paper : " It seems that Archer can Hog horses as well as any other jockey, for he cut up Duke of Richmond most unmercifully when he hadn't the ghost of a chance with St. Gutten. He afterwards had some disagree- ment with the owner of the colt, the Duke of i Richmond, and handed in his cap and jacket. It is said that the Duke also found a grievance in Archer talking to a bookmaker. Archer to plied that he was a married man who had made a home for his family, and realised an independence, and if the Duke disapproved of his conduct Archer thought he could maintain his home without his grace's patronage." St. Galirn's sire, The Rover, was recently found dead in his stable, his throat having been cut by some cowardly ruffian or ruffians. The spurting Life thus chronicles the event : "A barbarous outrage was committed upon The Rover, undoubtedly the site of the Derby dead-heated and Cesarewitch winner, St. Gatien. This stallion was located at Mr. Shine's stable, Listowel, county Kerry, and as the owner is in the court of bankruptcy, and the horse's future destination was in doubt, considerable excitement prevailed in the neighbourhood, especially as the horse had for some time been in the hands of the court's officers. On the night of Wednesday, we regret to say, The Rover's throat was cut, and when found in his stable he was quite dead. The Rover, by Blair Athol out of Canon, by New- minster in his yearling days cost 150 guineas at Cobham, but he never won a race, and, sink- ing by degrees in the social scale, passed into the possession of Mr. Knowles, the well-known Epsom ' Hy' proprietor, who in turn sold the horse after unsuccessfully advertising him for sale at ยฃ50 for a few pounds to Mr. Shine. But previous to his being banished to Ireland the Rover's services had been called into request for two or three mares at the Worcester Park Stud, owing to the illness of Rotherfield, hence his alliance with St. Gaticn's dam. It may be noted that the Rover was in conformity with the order of the court to be sold at Sewell's Repository, Dublin, for the benefit of Mr. Shine's creditors, and the last offer refused for him-a totally inadequate one-was 700 guineas. The detective department has the matter in hand, and two arrests are deemed imminent." The following from the London Sportsman sets at rest all doubt respecting Fred Archer's determination to leave England for a trip to Australia a "By the steamer Bothnia, which sailed from (Queenstown for New York on the afternoon of the 12th November, the celebrated jockey Fred Archer took his departure for America. He was accompanied by his old attendant (Solomon), and by Captain Bowling. Archer fools his recent sudden and terrible bereavement very keenly indeed, and we understand that for the purpose of rest and a thorough change of scene he intends to go over- land to San Francisco and visit Australia before returning to England. His present intention is to remain absent from home for some months."
