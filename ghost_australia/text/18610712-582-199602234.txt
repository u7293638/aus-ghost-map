THE FRYER'S TOWN MEDICAL COLLEGE. Sir, — Perhaps you are not aware that Fryerstown can boast, among its other public institutions of a Medical and Surgical College. If so, let me en- lighten you. Dr John Sheldon, vulgarly styled butcher, but by courtesy, slaughter house practi- tioner, is the presiding genius of the school, com- prising in his own person the whole faculty. It is true the worthy doctor's experience of anatomy is limited to the dissection of beef and mutton for his customers, and his knowledge of the materia medica to the ingredients of a drench or a purging ball, yet he evinces in the advertisement in your contempo- rary a proper jealousy for the honor of the regular profession. The doctor has an establishment — yclept the Fryer's Town Dispensary — consisting of a slab hut, with a front window, sundry shelves, much haunted by spiders, a counter, an old pair of gold scales, and sundry bottles of divers hues and shapes — the ghosts of departed visions and spirituous liquors, despatched by former inmates. Leaving Dr Black, who, it is to be feared, as the last tenant, has not yet discovered the "certain fortune," which the correspondent of the Advertiser guarantees to the future occupant of the Fryer's Town College — to settle with Dr Sheldon the quarrel of the "legally qualified," I am really curious to see who will be tho next orthodox practitioner, whom our Macænas of medicos and conservator-general of the health of the district will introduce to the patronage of the benighted residents of Fryer's Town, and whether unlke Dr Sheldon's first importation he will have better recommendations than a fondness for bulls, blarney and brandy, like the second, ignorance only exceeded by assurance and recklessness, and other habits acquired among a distant population, whose normal state is said to be inebriety.
