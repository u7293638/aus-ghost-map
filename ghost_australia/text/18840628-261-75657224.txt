IPoeti'v> For those wlio Fail. "ALL honor to him who shall win tho prize," The world has cried lor a thousand yours; Bat to him who tries, and who fails, sod dies, I pre great hdnor, and glory, and tears. Giro glory, and honor, and pitiful tears To all who (ail in thoir deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were born with Time in advance ot lune. Oh, great is the her* who wins a name, Bat greater, many and many a time, Soma pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And neat is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from Wine; Bnt the man who bile and yet still fights on, IiO, he is the twin-born brother ot mine. Joaquin MUer in the Philadelphia Press.
