From the LISBON GAZETTE of March 23. The whole Peninsula is convinced of the numerous expedients of falsehood and intrigue by which the French endeavour to mislead and corrupt the public mind. There is not a syllable in their papers respecting Spain that is not dictated either by malice or imposture. According to these, only a few rebels oppose their authority, when it is known that all ranks, from the highest to the lowest, detest their tyranny and breathe hatred and vengeance against the satellites of the despot. Could it be against a few opponents that the French have brought such numerous armies, such a host of cavalry, and such a quantity of artillery? But wjhere are now these multitudinous forces? If they could at this time lift up their heads, they would tell you that they were the victims of a cruel ambition, and that, at a distance from the tomb of their fathers, they have shed their blood.-Some farther observations of this kind are followed by a calculation of the number of French who have fallen in the first two campaigns of the war, making it amount to 163,000 men.
