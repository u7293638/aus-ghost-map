In mr case thej bold themselves to be free from the lists involved in the partnership. Surely ibis is nothing more than is cwapajfoie "fidth -obit is righteous and just. Bat the grind complaint at present is that it is no; deemed either 2a--rfn] or right 07 creditors of mining companies. The question arises then, why partners in ciiainj companies should be pl&ssd; on ss direren: a footing from partners in other companies that they can never free themselves from the liabilities or the ventures in ~hieh they hare once been engaged. A. and B. being original shareholders, may have held on to the last. Tries the fatal crisis of tss-'-IreccT has fallen on their or C. and D. m.ay be shareholders holding similar positions by purchase, vrhiist E, and F. are the parties from ~hom they acquired their shares. Nor- it appears ihat if A. and B. and C. and D. are no: -north powder and shot. or alL or any of them have cied or dis- ; appeared. E. and F. may be made liable for :he pecuniary responsibilities of the com- I piny; out of Tviich they had long sold. Moreover, although A. and B. and C. and D. may be present in the flesh and sub stantial in means, E. and F. may be pur- j sued equally "rrith them for the liquidation J of debts. This may be law as it stands, bat j it is consumed!;,- bad law, which cannot be defended on any equitable grounds. Never theless the creditors of a. mining company have certain legal claims,, and their right to enforce them cannot be denied. They ought no: to be subjected to abuse, far less to threats, for seeking to recover their money. V<~e have every reason to believe that the Commercial Bank in the present instances would be ready to meet its debtors in a fair spirit, and we would submit to tlie latter that it would be highly advisable on their pans to avoid giving cause for provocation. We hope the whole matter will be calmly discussed at the meeting this afternoon, and that au endeavor Trill be made rather to effect an equitable compromise than, to perpetuate bad feeling and io create an undesirable impression abroad which may tend to the detriment, as much of the mining community of the district, as of the banking corporation which professes to be seeking nothing mere than its just and legal rights. There are. with out doubt, many things to be taken, into consideration, which render it necessary that all the circumstances should be carefully inquired into and deliberately discussed. SuppLitMzxx.—A supplement is published with this morning's issue. The CofcPORATiox Laborers. — At the meeting of the City Council yesterday a letter was received from one M. Downs, applying for employment as a laborer a; Lake VVeeroona. Tins application baring been read, Cr. Aspiuail asked vyho had the power of erasing the laborers, to which the town clerk replied the surveyor or Mr, Ga/Jd, according as they were required. Cr. Bayne lb-.-;' stated that he- had recommended a man named lJowus to Mr. Gadd for employment. and had been informed by Downs that Mr. Gadd said he was just the man to suit for the work required to be done, and yet after thai another man had been taken on. The town clerk said in respect to the man mentioned by Cr. Bayne, he was informed bj Mr. Gadd that be would not have him at any price. Crs. Aspinall and Clark advocated the cause of the applicant, he having been a resident of Bendsgo for about 25 years, and at the present time was residing on the borders of Lake Weeroona, and could, as he said in bis letter of application, look after it, if necessary on Sundays. A brief discussion ensued, in the course of which the mayor pointed out that it wa3 rather vifra dij. for councillors to take the course they had, and contended that if the officer in whose department a man was wanted was not qualified to select a man, hs was not worthy of holding the position bo did. It sub sequent!}' transpired that the man Dovrci3 men tioned by Cr. Bayne To! not the present ap plicant for employment, and the subject dropped by the letter being simply received. The Diamond IJkill.—It is intended to start removing ihe diamond drill from its present site to tlio G.G. Consolidated Company's lease 011 Monday next. The derrick has be._-n taken down, and the other appurtenances of the drili have been disconnected. It is sincerely to be hoped that the boring operations will be more successfully conducted on the new site than they were on the old, aud that the vexatious delays which have caused the drill to be regarded as : something of a "'white elephant," will be less frequent in the future than they were iu the past. Visit of School Ciiii.dp.ek.—We understand that on Thursday next the school children of Brighton intend, visiting the local exhibition, and that on the following day (Friday) the Carlwn children are to pat in an appearance in this city. Thi3 influx of youngsters in our midst will no doubt make the city wear an animated appearance. Arrangements are aiso beinjj made so that the local school children can visit the exhibition at a low rate. A Bolt.—A horse attached to a buggy bolted yesterday morning from Charing Cross down Pall Mall, and up Mundy-street at a very fast rate. The runaway belonged to Mr. Hugh M'Devitt, of the Criterion Hotel, in Muudy street, and in endeavoring to turn into the stable at the hotel named, the animal stumbled and fell. The horse sustained a few bruises but the buggy was uninjured. lUiCi-sr tz- g±s ilixss:—Ii «?==.£. tiit ii : ::r.iie:_-itre 'ii tit — ~tit.g trier tit ■ -"I 1:.: Kiriiz-n-ii.:i -: i;:. i 11 Ci-Ifirrii >>—J ; ii :. :.::„:ily *:_: i - g. -t :. ?~t\y z'" - ~* is : ■ i: 11; zu* A: tie —■ eeriij ii tie C:ty ' ct-ss'h jis.tf.riiT, i letttr ttss rtoeivel rr:tr ; --It.

Their object was to request thai Bartsrd-strect, from the Moan; Koran? road to Violet-street, might be made and the footpaths formed. Tb~v pointed out that the street had been in a dangerous state for many years, and particularly requested that the roadway should be made, and at least one footpath. It wa3 pointed out to the deputation thai the public ivorks committee had voted a sum of £50 for the construction of a footpath as far as Don street, and tenders were received yesterday for the work, but as thev desired the whole work to be done, the committee, after a ietv ramarks, adjourned the further consideration of the sub ject until next week.

False Alarm, of Fike.—Soon after nine o'clock j-esterday morning the watchman at the look-cut tower rang out an alarm, and as a deDse volume of smoke was seen in the direction of Bridge-street, the brigades hurried in thai direction. On arriving in that locality, how ever, it was seen that the smoke proceeded from one of the chimneys at the " B.B." brewery, bat investigation proved that all the nre there was on the premises was underneath one of the boilers. Is seems that the men had gathered a quantity of chips from the wood heap, and had tilled the fireplace up with them, and being damp they emitted a heavy rolnme of smoke. The firemen, whose services were not required, were introduced to the cellars, and treated to some "B.B." Railway Employes' Picnic.—The railway employes at the local railway station hold their annual picnic to-day on the Flemington race course.

Mrs. Hogg's Art U>"iox.—The large col lection of oil. water color, and crayon drawings, which have been on view at the Industrial Exhibition since its opening, have attracted a good deal of attention, not only a3 they are the productions of a colonial artist, Mrs. M. L. Hogg, but from the fact that they are truthful sketches of colonial scenery. They are all artistically treated, and the details are carried out with careful attention, and are nicely mounted and framed. At the close of the exhibition the collection is to-be disposed of by art-nnion, and as the price of the tickets has been fixed at Is. each, it is within the reach of all who wish to have a chance of winning some of these valuable art treasures. The tickets are going off rapidly, and those who intend taking chances should do so at once, as there are not a great many tickets left for disoosal.

T. i vp Boards.—Considerable dissatis faction has been expressed with the removal or preiidents of shire councils and members of mining boards from local land boards, but the change (the Age says) appears to have had a benedcial enect so far as the operations of the latter are concerned. The improvement result ing from -.'.he change is particularly apparent in the Beechvrarth and \Vodonga district. The ! Eumbers cf tne cases deal! with in the months of February and April a: the various centres of this district at which the sittings of the board were held are as follows:—February: YacVandandah, 34; Tallangaita, 30: Beech worth, 13; YTosonga, 10. April: Oudgiewa, 20 ; Tailangatta, 54 ; Chiltern, 61 ; "Wodonga. 13 ; Beechworth, 14; Yackandandah, IS; Tar.-awingee, 41 ; Bright, 32. Total, 340. The progress made with business indicated by these iigurts is such as must naturally give satisfaction to all concerned. The selectors in most of the districts in which the board has sat have generally commended the course adopted by the Minister of Lands, who in removing those who might fall cndar the snspicien of being interested in delay is considered to have got rid cf a serious obstacle in the way of settlement, whilst by appointing an officer of the department to act in conjunction with the local surveyors he has secured the services of those who are most com petent to deal with selection. Ajcotkep. English Elevek. —A New Zealand newspaper states that while in Christchurch, Lord Harris gave some of the prominent players to -understand that on his return to England he would endeavour to arrange for getting together j the strongest team of gentlemen players in Eng- i land, to include Grace, Steele, and the Hon. Mr. | Lyttleton ; and that if the projected negotiations came to a saccessful issue, the team would come | out in two years from this time, and play in 2sew I Zealand before eoinj to Australia. Banquet at Lancetn:id.—A new bridge a: Lanceneld was opened by the Acting Chief Secretary on Thursday. There was a banquet in celebration of the event, at which addresses were delivered by Sir Byran O'Lcghlen, Major Smith, Mr, Woods, the Hon. Dr. Dobson, and others.
