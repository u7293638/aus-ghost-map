Mr. FLETCHER: It is not of so much importance to know which of the Ministers will introduce it as when the bill will be introduced. Sir HENRY PARKES: At an early date. We want to get it out of the way. (Laughter.) Mr. O'SULLlVAxV: You will find it awkward with your followers. ' WEST WALLSEND AND MONKWEARMOUTH ACT AMENDMENT BILL. Mr. J. S. FARNELL moved for leave to bring in a bill to enable the "Wost Wallsend Coal ComDany, Limitod," and tho "Monltweannoiith Colliery Estate" Company of Australia, Limited," to amend the " West Wallsend and Monkwcarmouth Act of 1886." Tho motion was ngreod to, and the bill was introduced and read the first time. THE CASE OF JOHN MULLENS. Mr. STOKES moved for copies of all correspondence, telegrams, and minutes which passed between the Minister for Works and the road inspectors (MoBsrs. Adams and Moreton) having reference to the .dismissal of John Mul- lens, the maintenance man on the roads at Condobolin ; also, for copies ot petition, telegram«, and letterä recoived from the residents of Condobolin, and rcplios thoroto. in- cluding the report of Mr. Woods, who specially reported upon the caso. The motion was agreed to. SUBMARINE MINING STORES. Mr. THOMPSON moved for copies of all letters, minutes, roports, and other documents (not of a confidential character) sent or made by any oflleer in the service of the Government, either to the Colonial Seoretary or any other Minister, or to any othor such officer, respeeting, or in con- nection with, tho report made by Colonel Crosmond, R.E., to the Inspector-General of Fortifications under the Im- perial Government, since the first day of January, 1882, relativo to submarine mining stores and dofonces In Aus- tralia, or as to so much of such report as relates to the de- fence of this colony. The motion was agreed to. CITY OF GOULBURN GAS AND COKE COM- PANY'S AMENDMENT BILL.

SYDNEY BISHOPRIC AND CHURCH PROPERTY BILL. On tho motion of Mr. Melville, the Sydney Bishoprio and Church Property Bill was read the third time, passed, and forwarded to the Legislative Council. THE CUSTOMS BILL. Mr. RYRIE asked the Colonial Treasurer, without notice, when he intended to proceed with the Customs Duties Bill. Mr. BURNS replied that ho had intonded to proceed with the Customs Duties Bill that ovening, but that inten- tion was interfered with by the debate upon the question of pastoral rents. The Colonial Secretury intended to proceed to- morrow with the second reading of the Railways Bill, and that being disposed of, tho Government would go on with tho Custoijas Bill. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. Sir HENRY PARKES said he hoped it was quite understood thnt, if .the Government business was postponed to allow of tho resumption of the debate on the question of pastoral assessments, bon. members would also postpone privato notices of motion. He could not agree to postpone Government bus ness to enable some hon. gentleman to bring forward private business. (Hear, hear ) He moved that the Government business, standing as orders of the day, be postponed until after the debate on the pastoral assess- ments. The motion was agreed to. Sir HENRY PARKES then moved,-"That the wholo of the general business on the notice-paper he postponed, and stand as notices of motion for to-morrow.' The motion was agreed to. THE BULLI COMMISSION. Mr. MELVILLE asked the Minister for Mines, without notice, when the papers would be laid on the table which he had moved for in reference to the Bulli Commission. Mr. ABIGAIL said that he would give the hon. member a copy of the papers to- morrow, if they were ready, as they were now being prepared. ALLOWANCE TO PASTORAL TENANTS. Mr. FITZGERALD asked the Minister for Lands, without notice, whether, in the collection of the increased rentals, he intended to make any reduction or allowance for the years 1885 and 1886. Mr. GARRETT replied that he had no legal power whatever to do this. He had dealt with the matter in the bill now before Parliament, in which he proposed to give the pastoral lessees time to pay up, in instalments, tho arreara which had accumulated during the years 188Ó and 1886. PASIORAL RENT ASSESSMENTS. The adjourned debate on Mr. M'Millan's motion, " Thnt in the opinion of this House the rents as assessed by the local land boards should not be increased, except in cases where either corruption or incompetence ran bo clearly proved against the members of such boards," was then re- sumed. Mr. WILSO V said he was sorry that the Minister for I Lands, in replv to the mo\ er of this resolution should have raised so many side issues, and, either intention ilh or thoughtlessly, should havo considerably fogged up the point at ltsue The question was, whether the land boards as originally constructed wero competent to undertake their work In his opinion, tho feeling and intention of a large number of members of the House v>bon this measure was passed was that the question of rents shoull bo practicalh left to the decision of the land boards The Minister for I ands, in dealing with th s Act, seemed to assume the position of judfe ma revision court £\ en if the Minister hud a prerogative, he contended that tho prerogative of the Minister was sunplj to seo that the officera of Lis Depirtment put the matter fiinly before him Ho deprecated the action of Air Copoland., late Minister for Lands, in fixing the rents m a number of stations at a small advance, in some cases only 1-oOth of a penny above the minimum, and said that the only reason the Minister could heve had for putting on »"this small increaso was to bar the right of appeal This notion of the late Minister was most unjustifiable, and would result in leaving a number of the lessees with a good substantial grievance They had been told that all the cases of losses in connec- tion with squuttages of late j ears hud arisen on account of the high prices giyen for then?, but this was fal from being tho case, and he quoted a caso in which the facts v ore quito to the contrail in which the holder of the land had been a squatter from first to last, and now with the rental under the present Act he stood to lo«e £2000 per annum in ordi naryseasons,notallowingfordroughts And thiswasacaseet tho micimumrental,and thero had been nosmkingof purchase money in question The Minister had stated that there wero onlj 16 cases in which rents had not been pnid np to the present time Well, tho reason of that v, as that no appeal would be hoard until eierj shilling of arrears was paid up Li believed that under these circumstances there wero a number of cases in which protests had been lodged although the rents had bien paid [Mr. G uuiett Not a do¿on ] Ho contrasted the advantages offered to squatters m South Australia as against those in this colony Lessees had held to their property up to the present, hoping that the Government would correct some of th" mistakes of the Act of ' 8S4 A very unfair side issue had been raised by the Minister with regard to the length of the leases in the V estera and Central dtvisions( but he did not Buy anything about the Eastern division, and be (Mr Wilson) now asked, was it a fact that tho Minister had given notice to lessees in that division that no applica- tion for extension would be granted ? What would us the rosult »hen the r 10 years' loases wero up? The Minister had stated that there wero only six or seven cases of runs hai ing boen abandoned , hut how many, ho (Mr Wilson) uked, had been thrown up on tho south side of tho Namoi,? Over 200 000 acres of country within 20 miles of Narrabri, m which ho had been interested, had been gives up when this Act was passed He had offered it for sale for £10J, butnoono would take it with the risk of tho rent Yet this land wag within 20 miles of a railway station. Ho had no interest in the Western division, hut at the same time he hud a peifect knowledge of almost every run referred to on the previous evoning by the Minister for Lands So fur as the Central division was concerned, he should mateo but ven little of tho griovences I ho Minister mudo a great appeal to the I ouse m offering to the western lessees to take buck their runs if they would give up thoir loores But what was tho use of the bon frontlo nian making such on iipical when he knew that the holders of those leases had sunk thousands of pounds m their hold lags, and wero living in the hope o'getting soino -f it back? Tho question of rent would neccsianlv bo considered with the question of tenant right 1 hoy had also to consider the ciicuinstnnc->s under which *ho aprraisoments -vero made. The pro ent scnaon wbb no crttoiion whatever Tho ínspeo | tiou ni tho v,e«torr division wis not mud» until nfie* the drought had biokec ap and the countn was in a flourishing condition Then again, in spito of what the hon gentle- man hrd Btnted, it Mas a well-knovo foot that the runs in the Murrumbidgee district would only carry one sheep to two acres, }et soiro of the assessments were Od , 7d_, andßd Ho pirtioulurlv took exception to tho lroiusion of Mr. Garrett in the Almicr-; as Minister for Lands, on Iho giound tim* it was unfortunate Kth for the coun'ry ani I the lion, member Li nself, that he should ha\o -eeu plrcoH in tho position of a judge ci tho affairs of many persons fe whom he vas a paid agout, spcci-Ur rctaiuod Mr G 4.PRETT »aid ibis was not true, and that he had taken ne iart m any '"'rows buids hiitnnosg for al loaet 12 months before h* took office Mr WILSON nccepted the disclaimer, hut still he'd I that it was unfortu.ute "hat the hen member had been so i thoroughly idont- fíed with the. land vusmeu. lie went on ' to ariruo that it was not th« Wennon of 'ho Ac* to enable) tho Minister to ovornde the decision of the land hoard as was now hemp: done The oiigmil intention of the Ai t was to mako tho land boards the assessois, hut it was altered, under strong pressure, to give this power to the Minister, hut only on the assumption that it would be exercised by the Minister sitting as in an open court It was the intention of everybody who had anything t» do with it that the rants as appraised by the local land board» should be the rents paid Mr R B. AVTLKINSON contended that the Minister lind no right, under this Act to de ii with these rents, ex ci pt in open court, or to alter any one of them, oven in open court, without first having a re-hennng of the case The intention of tho Legislature undoubtedly was that the rent in all casos shall be determined not by the Minister but hy tho Land Court The clause defining the Land Court, when the bill left the House laid down that the Land Court shall consist of the Minister sitting in open court But when it got to the Upper House there was a motion brought forward by Mr Piddington to tho effect that the word "Minister" Bhould be struck out of that clause, with a view of inserting the words " three lesponsible officers appointed by the Go- vernment" lho House, how ei er, only got as far as striking out tho word, ns after having done thnt, it dis- covered that if it went further it would bo tronching on the Privileges of the Constitution, in consequence of which Mr .co brought in an amendment in order to restore the clause as far as possible to its original form by substituting " Sec retarvfor Lands" lorthoword "Minister." Butit wascon tended that, supposing he was unable from illness to attend, or from some other causo wus not available, no court would in that case be held, and it was then suggested that if tho Mimstor could do nothing except in open court, it was use- less to totara tho clause, which »as accordingly struck out 1hut was how the word " Minister" carne to take the placo of tlft " Land Court " The intention unquestionably w as that the Minister should sit and act as in open court, and tho whole Act was framed on that understanding Ho could quite understand lho objection of the Minister for Lands to an open court, as he (Mr Gnnott) had ut all timos confessed himself an cnemv to this Act, just as he hud at all times confessed himself an enemy to operf ad- ministration und its decentralisation Thnt was the tendency of Mr Garrott's administration What was he contonding for now, except the destruction of tho land boards? He contended that the Minister had no power to determine rents, except in open court, and none to raise them without relerring tho case to the local boards for rehearing. As the bill bad been presented to the House, a clear distinction was made between tho functions of the Minister in camera und sitting as a lnnd court Again, what was the use of hxing a minimum at all if these boards weie to have no power? AVhat was the good of this local administration r Ihoy would have done better to go hack to the Lund Act of 1880, n Inch provided that the Minister on getting tho as-,cssmeut of rentirom an appraiser could not alter it without first submitting the matter to an open court of three nppraiseis and securing their agreement 1 ho intention of the Act was that if the Minister, acting as a court, objected to any rent, he had a n^ht to refer it back to the local board for rehearing, but the lessee had no right to appeal unless the ront was fixed at the minimum. When the land question was «ubmittcd to the country m 1882, bir Alexander Stuait pUced his policy before the country most distinctly in nine principles. One of these principles was that the local lnnd boards were to inquire in open court into all matters affecting tho administration of the law, with the right of appeal from its decisions Tho principle was then placed as clearly before the country as the question of free-trade was at tho last election, and was answered as distinctly as possible They had no right to alter that principle, unless they wenf back again and appealed to the country If they were to allow the Minister for Lands to torture these clauses of the Act bo as to do away with this principle altogether, then they wcro betraying their constituencies, and acting as traitors to the country The pastoral in- dustry was one of great" magnitude, and was suffering from such a depression, caused by these delaya and uncertainties with regard to the land administration, that if the present depression continued much longer it must roMilt in the ruin ot a largo number of these pastoral- ists, and it this happened a huge comaieicial disaster would result Hon members w ere prone to look at the rent of a run in the same way as Ihey would look at the rent of a house or farm, but the cases were very different In the one case tho prope'ty belonged to the landlord, but in the other it belonged partly to the landlord and partly to tho tenant The landlord found the land and the tenant the improvements, without which the land would in many casos bo comparatively valueless. Large suma of money had been invested in these improvements, and therefore the tenant had to pay already a heal y rent in the shape of interest on the cost of these improvements It had to bo borne m mind that the tenant was pa\ ing two rents, one fixed by the interest on his improvements, and the other the rent on the crass. Beyond this interest on improvements there was the rabbit plague, which was on them. On one run the lessee» were spending at the rate of £10,000 per annum in the destruction of rabbits alone-three fourths of this bein,; returned bv the State. He did not wish to be understood as wishing to lower the routs of these runs. All ho wished was that the administration should be open and local, that the Act should be administered in its »pint, and that these runs Bhould hive a rent fixed which they were capable of hearing He also considered that a proper dis- crimination should be made between thoBo runs which could eairv stock and those rims which could not, and that proper allow ance sbi uld be made for the enormous sums which some of the lessees had to paj by way of interest on improvements Some allowance should be made as well for this plague of rabbits. Ihe House should bear in mind that these men were completely at its meicy. Ihey had invested everything they possessed in these properties. Bo thought hon. members did not see clearly the position in which the ow ners of theso runs stood, and he hoped that they would take all these matters into consideration when the amend- ing bill came before them He trusted also that the right of appeal would be given in all cases He contradicted t'ie statement which had been made by the Minister fur Lands that the appraisements were based on inspections made when the runs were m a state of drought He had been asked why he voted for the Land Act of 1884, and he took that opportunity to otplam why he bad voted for it He had done so becadse he considered it was a vast im- provement over the Land Act of 1861 because by the di vis ou of runs it did away with the antagonism between squatter and selector because it gave the machinery for arriving at a lair rental of the estate of the country becuubo it had centralised the administration and, above all, because it provided for the administration of tha law in open court I hat Act was not perfect, 1) it had, bv destroj ing the antagonism between the tv, o clnssi s on the lands brought about the realisation by them that they were not two interests, but one and the same They had commenced to realise how much each class was dependent on the other, and to what an enormous extent the prosperity of the country was dependent upon that of the pastoral interest Ihe faults in that Act had arisen in a great measure from the ignorance of the sub- ject which obtained at that time, and from an antagonism of twenty j ears between squatter and selector, these faults had been aggiavated and intensified by delay in bringing that law into operation and by attempts to administer the Act contrary to its Bpmt and intention such as that with which they were now dealing Mr COPELAND complimented the Minister for Lands on the able speech whi ho had delivered on the previous evening The motion before the House said that the rents of the pastoral holdings should not bo increased, but it said nothing about the decreases Certainly in his (Mr Copeland's) time ho had mado as many, per- haps more reductions than he lind increases But his chiof object in addressing the Houso was to deal with the leguhtj of the question-whether the Minister had the ri^ht to interfere with the recommendations of the board or not He took it that although the boards were appointed for the purpose of dece ltruliBation, yet the chief intention was that thoy Bhould adjudicate between the different applicants- (hear, hoar)-that local boards could inquire better into these matters than the Minister But it would bo a most unwise pohcj, indeed suicu'al, were thoy to hand over t e laige revenues whioh would be derived | from tho public estate to an irresponsible set of men (Hear, hear ) Objection had been taken to the Mimster deciding these matters, but no exception hud been taken to the Alinister's nominees doing so Practically in | the greater number of cases it was the chairman of the board v. ho gave the decision As a rule, what ho s ud the other members of the board agroed to The Minister it was posible for the countrj, through its representatives, to at any time call to account, but they could not do so with the chairman of a board What special qualification had these mon? Had they any greater knowledge of squatting than the average run of Ministers who filled the position of Minister of Lands? The local boards hud to be guided by evidence and reports, so that if the land board was m a position to decido by reason of ha\ ing tho report of the run appraisor before it, how much more should the Minister be able to form nn opinion by having the roport of tho run appraiser and the report of the land board before him as well But there was a BtiUmoraiupor ant question than that to bo consideied If the decisions of the various boards were to be aken, they would virtually have 16 land laws in operation at the samo time That wub the reason why he app-eciated the existen«, of a com t of appeal All the recommendations should filter through one drain at last The hon gentle- man attempted to make a strong point bv saying that the land boards had all the witnesses before thom "'hen tho cases had to be decided b, the Minister on appeal, he had to decido them withou* seeing the witnesses No fresh ovi donco could bo taken in a oase [Mr Ahboti He coull cull fresh evidence if > ».

It seined absurd to him that nomo of .ile lundi that por-le wou d bo willing to give 20s and dOs. per aero tor nt auction should bo leased nt 2d per acre All those cases wore Bent back by him to the local land boards for a re- . vision of the decision, and they were afterwards returned | with the rents fixed at 3d , 6d , 6d , and some even na high as Is an acre. He contended that the decision with respect to the whole matter rested with the Minister Ihe hon member for East Sidney has made capital of tho use of the term "determined " by the department in writing to tho chairman of the board but this meant meielv that the mnttorshould be dealt with, subiect to tho approval ot the Minister He went on to stnto that in many cases land rented at about 4d was worth from Is to 2s He did not think the pastoralists had any great reason to conirjlnin of tho rents up to tho present He thought tho present Minister had adopted a somewhat high standard in fixing it at Is Ho had himself rated tho lnnd at from 5d m tho west to 9d in the east, according to the quality of the land, and m the south it wont up to Is It would be time cnoutrh for the squatters to complain after the appeals had been decided Probably the Minister would reduce the rents materially m the case of exceedingly poor land The rents now flxod wero in many cases simplv a fraction of what the land was worth The people who dealt with these lands made enormous fortunes and the country got no return for it For example, there wus a rent recommended hy the board at id an acre, and he increased it hy one hundredth of a penny He hold it was the duty of the Minister to oxorciBo this discretion ThiB run was a very largo one, and the enormous amount by «hich ho increased the rent waa actually £6 ás There was also a resumed area on which the increased rental amounted to £6 3s lid , nnd the Tesult was that some 2H6 300 acres wero handed over for lo years, nnd tho Minister actually had tho audacity to inereaso tho rent by £12 6s lid. There was another case of a pastoral holding of 34 167 acres recom- mended at Id , andmcreased by the one-hundredth of aponnv, and the total amountof thoincrease\vas£l 8b od "iettheso two cases had boon published, and lomplaintR made of his raising the rents Ho held that tho Minister had a perfect right to stop useless and oxponsivo appeals U hat was the good or an appeal if there was no chance of getting a reduction of tho assessment ? Ho trusted that tho Minister would not be carried away by the conditions of the land m \ letona which was admittedly iicher than our own, excepting, peihaps, tho Riverina district If Victoria was getting 1b a sheep, we should bo satisfied with 8d or 9d , and only in exceptional cases Bhould wa look to receiving lOd or 1b a sheep In cases of poor lnnd even 4d a sheep would bo a fair price to expect 1 here was another matter in which Mr barrett was in orror Hehadstatedthatinnppraisingtheynlueof thelands, tho grazing capabilities of the alienated lands hud also been takon into consideration 1 hut, however, v. as uniust, as they all knew that the ej es hud been picked out of the lands of this colony, and tho alienated lauds should not therefore be made tho basis of a general appraisement In his opinion tho Minister was not oxceedmg his duty in appraising the lands Tho board was meielv a boaid of advice, which furnished tho Minister with information, and the Minister was competent to sit m lus chamber and-having the report of tho sun evora beforo him nnd the full report of the appraiser, snvins every kind of information as to the geological formation, the nature of the timber on the land, tho quality of the grass which grow on it-to appraise the actual value of the land Mr KLLLY said that the Government had given him sufficient justification to desert their sido of the House, as ho would prove conclusively before sitting down W ith regard to the subject under diBcuBsion, he pointed ont that in many places m the Western Division the eyes of the land had been picked out of it by the homestead lessees, and taken on a lo years' lease at Id, per acre These men had to spend very little on improvements, and in many cases found waterholes ready for them on the ground It any hou member thought there was such a splendid thing in squatting at Id per acre, let them go to this district, whero ho could show them fifty 10,000-acre blocks with water on them and yet thero was no one willing to take them up 1 rom the very first he had found fault with this Land Act, because it was built up on a fictitious foundation It was assumed that the Crown lands of the colony were j worth 20s per acre, but so long as we had nothing better to do with them than to graze sheop on them, he doubted whether they were worth one fourth of the money He quoted statistics showing the actual cost to a selector going upon d40 acres under the old Act and that under the prcsont I he increased rental would, with an expenditure of £224 per annum, including inten st on money borrowed and invested in the property, and a return of £160 from sheep in a good season, add £16 to the debit side Ile denied that tins was wholly a merchants', bankers', and squatters' crv , the selectors were just asdeoply interested In his district the selectors had for years past consistently agitated against the law, and they would not be satisfied until they could get the minimum abolished altogether. He should O) pose any Government that acted cruelly towards the people by unjustlv raising the rents and adopt- ing a course opposed to the best inteiests of the country He contended that in many instances land taken up for grazing purposes was rented merely as a herding- place for stock, which wero Bold in the first good market He submitted that anyone who waa not present when evid°nce was given bearing upon the value of particular land would not be fui h qualified to come to a determination upon that ovidence, and in support of this view he read certain ovidence which had been takon at a land court, and pointed out that matters which were most material, whioh were to his own knowledge deposed to, had been omitted from the depositions That showed conclusively that who- ever was to be judge in the matter should hear the evidence In conclusion the lion member said he did not find fault with the law, but with the manner in which the law hod been administered Mr ABBOIT said the matter before the House was one that ought to be dealt with apart altogether from party circumstances He felt some difficulty with regard to the resolution of the hon member for bouth Sydney, which said that the rents as assessed by the boards should not bo increased except in cases of corruption and in- competence In cases of corruption he aimitted that there ought to he that interference As to the question of incompetence, who was to decide what was im ompetence ? One board might fix a rent at a certain sum per acre, m hue another Doard might think thal thoy were incompetent to deal with the question He waa in- clined to think that the House wus itself responsible for the difficulty in which bon members found thnmselves with regard to this question Provision was originally made in the Land Bill of 1884 with the object that matters of this kind should be decided, not by the Minister alone, but by two assessors sitting with him, who gave him advice That, however, was overruled He (Mr Abbott) had occupied the position or Minister for Lands and he knew the responsi- bility of sitting as au appeal court, and he had had a quali- fication which many of his successors had not, and that was training as a lawyer Many of the points to bo dealt with were of the most dtfhcult, technical legal character, and a Minister who had not the benefit of a legal training could hardlv, although he might take a very good common-sense view of the ca*e, deal with them as a lawyci coulddo T he 77th clause of the Act provided that the rents lu all cases should be determined by the Land Act after appraisement by the local board The House in its wisdom thought it would amend the bill by getting rid of the lund court The great objection that he (Mr Abbott) had to the action ot the Minister was that whatever he did in settlement of the rents he did behind the backs of the parties interested There was a well-known maxim of law which said " Hear the other side " Had the other side been heard in any one of these cases? It had been heard in reference to the appraisement, it had been heard before the local land boards, but not before the Minister A body of competent and capable men had dealt with the question-had called and got Ihe proper evidence The object of the Act was to have these things carried out in public, and to afford to every person an opportunity of placing his views before the board The decision of that board ought net to be set aside bj, the Minister sitting in his private room Ihe whole object of the Act was that the matter should heve publicity He did not behove that any Minister would ever act corruptly, but he had known a case under the old Land Act in which decision huu bcon given as many as three or four times, and it was to put Ja stop to this that the Act was passed He held that the provision that a responsible Minister should take the responsibility of going below the minimum v\as a wibo one, but his objection was that Mr Copeland and Mr Garrett had done in puvato what should have been done in publio, by notifying that the rents were to bo dealt with, and inviting all persons interested to attend if they wished to Thov had the right to bo heard, but we e not so heard at present, upon the subject of those rentals lhere wore cases in which injustico had been done by the increase of the rent ihe non the Minister had retened to the rents allotted m the Gloucester and Carcoar distrusts, but it did not follow that because people could pay 6d or Is in the Eastern division, they could do so in the Central or the Western And the hon member had, further, omitted to state the rainfall in thoso districts, which was tho chief element in the assessment Having regard to the unequal rainfall m vai-ous parts of the colony, it was not fair to fix a uniform basis of assessment. Towards Milparinka, for instance, the oharacter of the country would deceive any stranger Ihe rainfall in that part was very irregular, but it was singular that immediately after a full of rain the vegetation sprang up with astonish- ing rapidity If wo had a regular rainfall the fact i should then be an element to weigh in fixing I tho tents, but when the rainfall wasirregulai, the circum- ' stance should guide them to the conclusion that the rents ought not to bo high Iho object lobe kept In violin dealing with this land question ought to bo to induce set- tlement No doubt some of our Crown lands'wero capable of settling an agricultural population Ho .eg'-etted that they had not long ago recognised that faot and re- served tho land for that purpose. If thev could en- courage settlement on the lands which remained, it was their duty to do so If they could settle a pastoral popula tion on them, it was their duty to do bp taking a leeson i rom Victoria, where the rents had been so fixed as to hunt away their pastoral populrtion Their objeot should be to improve the lands and encourage people to take thom up But for tho pastoral and minirg índuBtres what on earth would this colomy havo had to send out, ir spite of her free-trudo principles, except wool and coal? Now it had struck him, whilst hearing Mr Garrott lost night on the question of what, a shoep should pay for its keep, that the Minister for Lands w"s entirely at sea If 9d was a fair pnto *n charge for the keep of a sheep in a roh country, alongside of a railway station, was it fair to ihar¿r the same pr co for the ' vep of a sheep in a country where there was an absence of railway communi- cation, and the pastoralists could not command market ? What was fair, for instance, for the keep of » heep on Liverpool Plairs, would ho inequitable if bcma-ded for the koop of ono in count*y re- moved by many miles from facilities of transoort. If this motion had been moved from fms Bide of tho House, the Government would not have given the time to discuss it or they would have regarded it as a v ote of censure but now they postponed important business in ordor to diseusa it What beneficial result could ensue from a motion of this kind ? It could have no practical result, and what i was the use of wasting all this timo of the House on it P Since the present Land Act was passed, the rabbit plague had come on the western district, but what consideration had been given to this plague in assessing the rent of the runs. ThiB pest should cort/unlv be considered m fixing the rents Ho was not advocating the squatters' causo for if thoy could turn tho land to better purpose than using it for grazing purposes let thora do so Ho maintained that the improve ments effected on runs should be an element to be taken into consideration in fixing the rents The Land Act of 1881 had given grave dissatisfaction bv dividing the runs Tho object of every hon member ought to bo to do justice to all classes in this community and that justice could only bo dono by making the occupiers pav a fair rent, hut justice would not be done if these occupiers wero driven out of the possession of the land If, after getting nd of these men who had spent the best part of their lives and their capital in this country, we hid to legislate for tho purpose of replacing thom, what benefit would it bo to the State ? He looked on the resolu- tion as unpractical and as a vote of oensure on the Govern- ment As a protest against the action of the Minister in dealing in a secret manner with these rents, he would record his vote in favour of this motion Mr HASSALL contended that whatevor the Interpre- tation of the Minister might be, the intention of the Houso at the possmg of the present law was, he believed that tho rentals should be fixed by the land boards If thoy were to return to tho system of centralisation then they might as well never have passed the Act of 1884 He maintained that the boards wore better qualified with local knowledge at theirdisposal, to Bettie the rentals than was the Minister lhe feeling ra the country was that tho Government wero endeavouring to make up the deficiency that would result from doing away with tho ad va orem duties by increasing the rentals of the Crown lessees There was also an im- pression throughout the country that the Govern- ment intended to do away with soiro^ of tho local boards, and, as matters stood, it was felt that very serious injury was being done by the Minister overriding the decisions of these hoards Tho boards having beeu appointed and being paid for hy the country should do the work they wore established for the purpose of doing and tho country should be able to fool that the rentals woie fixed upon the basis of evidence taken in oDen court and on information obtained upon tho spot He instanced tho rentals paid for graying properties along the Queensland coastal districts to show that greater facilities wore offered in that colony for settlement than in New South Wales He thought glentor inducement was held out for people to go and settle in Queensland than was held out for people to como here lho rents UDon land on the Liver- pool Plains had been assessed at 1 8-9d per acre, and there w us no grazing lind in this colony better than that The people on the Upper Hunter had been assessed at jd per acre In the Moice district the rents were assessed at 2 2-9d In Warialda district the average assessment was 2¿d The Mernwa run, on the M'lntyre River, ou the borders of Queensland was assessed at 4d per acre on the leasehold That wag an act of injustice which should he taken into consideration by the Minister lhe Minister for Lands had in many instances raised the rents fixed by the land boards fully 100 per cent lhere would be moro satisfaction amongst the people if tho determination of the rents wore left to I three rather than to one individual ii" thought it was an arbitrary act on the part of the Mimstei ) r iiBe the rents re commended by land boards by from oO lo lOO percent So far from it beingcorrect thatthemspections vi ere made ina bad season, the appraisers visited the Moree district under ex ceptiunallv favourable circumstances He had not much confidence in some of the men sent up to appraise the runs in thut district He thought that a fair method of determin- ing the rentals would be by taking into consideration the number of stock the runs earned. Eightponce per head per sheep was a fair basil to work upon He hoped that tho House would consider the questions at issue in view of the increased hardships proposed to be in- flicted on the pastoral lessees Mr WADDELL moved the adjournment of the debato all 1'riday Mr WALL objec ed as he was sure they would never reach the debate on Friday Ho would, however, agree to the debate being adjourned till Thursday Mr DIBBS thought the debate should be adjourned till Thursday Sir HENRY PARKES »aid It waa true that the Government had reluctantly given up the whole of the r timo this week to the consideration of this question, but on a distinct understanding, and with the concurrenco of the gentleman who introduced the debate, that the matter should be closed to night He must again remind hon members not to consider tho Government-that was a matter of little concern-but to consider the country (Hear, hear ) They were in that conaition, that in tho second week in June they had not commenced the business which should have been done last yoar And h jw was th# business of the country to be got into any thing like it» natural condition if they did not take some care to economise their time ? Two night» should have been ample for a full discussion of this question, and although the Minister for Lands had taken, as he was entitled to do, a long time to express his views, it did not follow that every other member should imitate him. Most of the speeches might have been delivered in a much shorter time than they had occupied Be that as it may, he could not consent to give up another Government day to the discussion Of course the Government wore dependent on the course hon members chose to pursue If they chose to waste time he could not help that, but the Government must look to their duty, and wonldnot consent to an adjournment to the following day Mr TOOHEY said that he intended to support the action of the Munster for Lands, but he could net under- stand why Mr M'Millan should have introduced his motion, which was really ona of censure against one of the Government departments, and then try to avoid coming to a division upon it Sir HENRY PARKES said that if it were intended that the motion should mean one of censure on the Minister for Lands he would accept it as a vote of censure on the Government The Government, he wished the House to understand, would stand by their Ministers (Cheers ) Mr TOOHEY", continuing, held that tb» Minister hod the absolute right to fix the amount of rental There was no question in his mind that the Minister was right The question that the debate be now adjourned was then put, and was negatived, on division, of 46 to 17 votes Dr ROSS moved that the question be now put A division waa taken upon the question, with the result that 35 members votel in favour, and 29 against it There being less than 40 in favour of the motion, it was declared to be negatived, and the debate proceeded The motion was negatived by 46 to lo
