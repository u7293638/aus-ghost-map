One old-fashioned Bchoolmaster boasted that infllty years hehtid; givfen -SOP^SO canihgs and 124 proper floggings. Another record shows that during fifty-obe years in a large London school there ? wers administered 911,600 oaninge, 121,OOO41ogging0, 208,000 custodes, 136,000 tips teidr ft rale*, 10,200. boxes on the ears and 227,000 tasks learned by heart, besides hundreds of thousands of ear pinches. During that time, in the same school, 6,000 boys were made'to kncel-on a sharp edge of wood, 700 to stand on peas and 5,000 to wear the fool's cpp. These severe punishments frequently had a comical eide, when the'pjiterit, being the superior ia size, turned thetableB njpon tbeworthy pedagogue, giving him a practical taste of his own idea ofcombuleory education.
