Bain and Sandells battel well. "All England's" courage rose with their batting. H. Johnston and Hall bowled very well, making the " blue and whites" exceedingly cautious. Is Gafford immortal? or was his nature moulded in the same groove as the renowned Kilkenny cats. He was only missed five times / . North batted Al in both innings. His total was well compiled. Bain snapped up a splendid catch--a credit to you Bob. " If the Baps would only field as well as they bat, their opponents would not reach the totals they do. Look to it, Baps. English by no means cast down by their defeat. Who said "Jock" is a "mug." He is not the worst. "Matt" Stokes " could not speak a word, for his heart was very full." Aye, and as white as a ghost, too, when." the end was I:'Vas "Matt'."frightcned of the bowling? What meant those vicious dabs ? Rumor has it that Christ Church intend giving Wesleya the match. SLooks like as if South Presbys have got" their tails, etc. Rouse yourselves, South.' Saints have found that there is something to play cricket for, after all. - Your turn next to beat the " reds." The competition is still open, boys. St. Mary's took the Chronicle's tip list week and beat the Presbys. " The Saints' win was due chiefly to the bowling of C. Roberts and J. Dennis, the former securing the fine average of 9 for 33 and the latter 8 for 47 for the match. C. Roberts, 23 and 25, batted in fine style for the Saints. Ward in fine form behind the sticks, the line for sundries being unused on the Presbys scoring sheet. Christison's 14 was very useful and made in good style.
