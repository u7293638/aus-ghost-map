BETJLE AND MILDRED/ The cosmopolitan bachelor' living an. apartments knows' far 'more of' Sanskrit: than of a domestic woman's feelings* as ; she explores the place sbe must call :her home. It may be-a-palace or it may be ' but two rooms inci' decaying' tenement,! but the same wistful, intent look wi]l,re veal one bt the. deepest -needs of her nature. Eve wept, not so much for, the loss of Eden as the loss of home— the famijjar place, whose homeliest objects had become dear frpm.-associatipn. The restless, woman;whp has, no.hqme,-;h.unger,' no, strong; instiin^t- to, make a,.place. which sjialij,be, a ; refuge,. fojc,.herself.and;'those. who., she ?loves,;iis.npt..the woman God: created, ;; She is. the product. of a sinister ey.ojution ; ? she is akin to the- birds . that wijl.not build-nests, but take possession of those, already, constructed, ousting the rightful '. occupants. v ..- Mrs. Jocelyn and Mildred were un perverted ; they were womanly in every, fibre, and the interest with which they planned, consulted, and dwelt upon each detail of their small household economy is beyond my power to interpret. They could have made the stateliest mansion in the city homelike ; they did impart, to their two - poor rooms . the . essential elements of a home. ? It was a place which no one could enter without in voluntary respect for the occupants, although aware of nothing concerning them except their poverty. 'Mrs. Atwood and Susan actually ? cried when we came to go,' Mrs. Jocelyn remarked as they were all busy together, 'and even old Mr. Atwood.was wonder fully good for him. He and Roger put a great many harvest apples and vegetables 4u a large box, end Mrs. Atwood added a jar of her nice butter, some eggs, and a pair of chickens. I told them that we must begin life again in a' very humble way, and they just overflowed1 with sympathy and kindness, and I could; scarcely induce 'them to take- any 'money, for the' last %eek' we:were%there.! ? If Was funny to see 'old 'Mt; At wood ; ' he wanted the money dreadfully-1— any one' could see1 that; for a dollar tedear'to his heart— but' he also' wanted 'to ' be-'ejenerou's'like liis wife,' and to1 show his 'strong' good-will. They sent heaps'of'love-to' you, Millie, and cordially invited1 'us to' visit'theriv nest summer ; they also bffere'i to'board us again' for j list' as little as they could afford.' Even Jotliatri' 'appeared' to have something on his 'rairid, for he'was as helpful as an elephant', and stood around j' !but at last went off muttering to himself.' ' Millie,' said Belle indignantly, ? I think yon treated- ' Roger Hufimefullyj After^'we returned'.' from seeing you off;' mamma rind I went mooning up to that hill 'of yOiirs looki ng towards th e sbut h,- because you and papa'wcre in that direc tion.11 Suddenly we 'carnU1 iipori1 Roger; sitting there' with bis face buried 'in his1 hands; !

The day before we came away something happened 'that took1 away niy breath;' A riian: brought a ybiirig 'horse 'which', he'said'no one' couW manage.' ; Roger weiSf : 'out; and ' looked into1 the beast's eye's'.1 and 'the vicious thing bit at1 him. and struck; at biiri with his forefoot. IThenras he tried- to i stroke ; his 'back he' !ki'clied'u'f) with both1 hind feet. Oh, :ihe' wasavery;Satilri of a' horse/Jand they had' a rope 'around his head .that would' have held a ship;. ' Roger went5 and got what he called 'si ?curb-bit,; arid almost in' a twinkling he had slipped1 it on the horse^ and without a inomMt's hesitation he sprang up !ori !his bare; back. The horse 'then reared so that I thought' he'd fall over backward on Roger/ Mamma fairly looked faint— it was right after dinner— Susan and the children :were crying, his fotber and mother, and even the owner of the horse were calling to1 him to get off, but he merely pulled one reirfsharply, aiid'dowri the horse came on his- four feet; again.. Instead of look ing frightened' he' was coolly fastening the rope so as to to have it out of the way. After letting the ugly beast rear and plunge and kick around in the road a lew minute^ Roger turned his head toward a stone wall that separated tho road from a large pasture field that was full of cows, and he went over the fence with a flying leap, at which we all screamed and shouted again. ? Then awav they went round and round the field, the cows, with their tails in the airj careering about also,' as miirjlj excited' as we were. At last, when tlie Horse found h'e couldn't throw hiin, lie laidj down'',and rolled;' Roger was off inasjeco'ndl'arid then 'sat On the beast's 'head for ,a' jWhile ' so He1 couldn't get up 'when hejiariled to!v'A|t last lie let'the brute 'geti'up 'a'gaii',!'but he was 'no sooner 'on ..his feet than' Roger, Was, on. iiis; back', J ari'd^ aWayVihey ' wenjt'1 aghin' till tb'e 'lior'se Was 'all.in'a fiiam^'and Roger could guide him''easiiy 'witfr 'one hand. r He .then leaped, him1 back into the road)[ and cajne' Jtrbttihg' ijui^rly', to the kitclien '' iipprl '.'Springing'1 lightly down, arid with' pnearm oyerthe panting horse's neck . he paid quietly,'' Sue,' bring1 mo two or three ' lumps of 'sugar.' ; ' The' hbrse ate them but of his hand, arid 'theii followed him.arpund like a spaniel.1...
