Their shadowy forms that linger are like the evening star Their robes of airy vestures as white as lilies are. And with the wandering ghost-forms from that far land so fair I see the fire lights-gleaming among their golden hair. Their silver wings around me waft all the songs of yore, ing truth— They tell the deathless beauty of love's eternal youth. The firelight gleams so brightly; ah, it reveals to me The forms I loved in childhood when my life was full of glee. I wander now amongst them as in those far-off days, When we gatherid golden wattle and beard the songster's lays. Their soft sweet voices linger, and bring me back the spring, When life was full of promise, a better, purer thing. Our lives were then so happy, but night winds softly stray, They whisper in my ear—those joys are far away. The fire is gently smouldering, the embers lose their glow, The nreath of sleep is wafting oblivion to and fro; The Southern Cross above me I know will gently A vigfiP where I'm slumbering in Lethe's arms South Australia, s, milbourn, Jnn.
