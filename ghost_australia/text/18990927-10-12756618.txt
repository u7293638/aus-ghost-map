THE DESERTED HOMESTEAD. The snow-grassed thatch is crossed and green, The walls are in decay The willows bend to touch the creek That sings along its way The garden fence is broken down The stakes are pulled away : And the ghosts are Hitting, Hitting where the grass is growing green. And the ewes and lambs are bleating where the flower-beds have been. The grand new homestead lies below, All painted clean and bright ; A wool shed, big and up to date, Stands full and fair in sight ; And the little pine plantations Lie around to left and right, And the ghosts are flitting, Hitting In the shadow and the sun, The ghosts of men I used to know, and the things that once were done. The bushes round the garden plots We used to know so well The paddock where the horses ran, Where Wally Stephens fell The gate that led to Wally's but, Have each a tale to tell ; And the ghosts are flitting, Hitting, where the grass is growing green, And the ewes and lambs are bleating where the men I knew have been. I see the chaps I used to know All round the water-hole, The daily hunt there used to he Vor soap the woodheap state They used to laugh and barrack then The station had a soul ; And, while the ghosts are flitting out of days of long ago, The brand new station grinds away like some machine below. There's not a sound except the creek That bubbles on its way, ( Where laughter used to sing the night After the working day The boys are scattered here and wide, And most of them are grey For the ghosts are Hitting, flitting where , we used to laugh so loud, And the gully. full of sunshine that is heavy as a cloud.
