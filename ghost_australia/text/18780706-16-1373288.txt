The Night Wind. ViEW.s, not voiceless, you sweep along, S id is the note of your constant song Mournful when fill the lost beams of light, S wider still in the Inuo midnight, When some wretched wanderer feels your breath, And shrinks at first for he would from death, Then hails the thought of a glad release, J. or Uo hears in your music a whisper Peace !
