GHOSTS. Some people believe in ghosts, and some Consider them all ado, Iike the spirits of Home—and that they're a hum I really think—don't you? Oh, a hollow turnip on top of a post, With a candle alight inside, And a long white sheet, is a kind of ghost That as boys we have often tried. There's another sample of ghosts—and that's The ghost of a haunted house; But that as a rule, I think, is rats, And oftentimes only mouse. But on real ghosts I have ne'er clapt eyes, Though I once committed a crime That will might empower a sprite rise, Aa the stroke of the midnight chime. For old Aunt Sally, that ancient aunt, I smote with a stick on the head; And her ghost, if legends speak truth, should haunt Her murderer's sleepless bed ! But I ne'er her ghost have yet caught sight, And I scarcely fancy I shall,— And Sarah perhaps is no wandering sprite, In short, no Volatile Sal. But ah, the ghost I would give the most If I could set eyes upon, Is what I cant see—and that's the ghost Of a chance of getting on! —Fun.
