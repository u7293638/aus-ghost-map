An American View of tho War. War is shaking his spear in old Europo — There's A prospect of murderous work; Tlio Turk eurls Ills nose at tho Russian — Thu Russian looks'bhick at the Turk. Tho Gorman is watohiug tho Frciicbuuui — Mounseor bridles up at Mciahuor ; And the dura scowl of proud Kaisor Joseph Is returned by Italia the Fair. The Lion thnt dwells on an island, But covers tho oarth with his paws, Is waiting and watching in silence, Tho volvat conooaliug his olnivs. A thrill wakos tho slow pnlso of Asia — Kahns and Caliphs nro arming thoir hosts. And grim Death with his baton stnuds ready To marshal his legion of ghosts. Shall wo weep ns wo see thorn prcpariug To scatter each other liko ohaif 1 ' It really scorns seareely decorous At others' misfortunes to laugh. Go to I Let those Itiugs butt oach othor Till thoy flatten the crowns on thoir heads ; We will grin wliou the war fairly openH, And laugh loudor tho further it spreads. [?]
