NEWS BY THE MAIL. TOPICS OF THE WEEK. (From Our Correspondent.) LONDON, Nov. 22 The Brighton election has held the first position in public interest during the week. Some peculiar circumstances have given it a wide importance. I mentioned last week that the death of one of the two conservative members of the borough had caused a vacancy, that the local conservatives, in pursuance of their undoubted rights, had nominated one of their own number for the vacancy, and that Mr. Goschen being applied to to come forward as a Unionist, had, on finding a candidate in the field, promptly declined, the matter was thought to be at an end, and a walkover for the conservative o candidate was very generally expected But in the beginning of this week a startling intrigue was set afoot A local Unionist placed himself in communication with Sir G. O. Trevelyan, who was then at Home, and gave it out that the right hon. baronet would contest the constituency, providing it appeared that his candidature would reunite the Liberal Radical party. Some of the Gladstonians jumped at this. There was not a ghost of a chance for any candidate of their own colour, and it was better to have the proverbial half loaf, for the reason more particularly that Sir G Trevelyan appearance as a candidate would deal a serious blow at the Unionist alliance. A mass meeting of Home Rulers and liberal dissidents being called, the invitation was at once given to Sir George Trevelyan in the name of a "united party " Preparations were at the same time set afloat for his reception, and a canvass was actually begun in his interest. Naturally all this created apprehension among the conservatives The near dant and the Globe, especially the latter, declared that the appearance of of Sir George at Brighton would be the beginning of the end of " the union of the Unionists for which the conservatives were prepared to sacrifice so much ' it must inevitably lead to reprisals by Conservatives upon the Unionist liberals Appeal was made to Lord Hartington to enforce his authority for the maintenance of the pact month the Government, and it was asked with much pertinence how far Sir George Trevelyan was ready to go to meet the views of the Home Rulers, who were to supporters at the poll 'the Home Rule press throughout the country was jnr contra, delighted at the prospect at Brighton The effect of Sir George's candidature on the Unionist alliance was fully appreciated in this quarter, and although it was as certain as any thing could be that he would not be elected, the demand was made all round that he should be supported. the political consistency has, happily, some adherents in Brighton These men Bought light from various quarters, and Mr. Labouchere was sufficiently straight- forward to say that he would only vote for Sir George Trevelyan if it was quite understood that he would never co-operate with Mr. Gladstone in regard to Home Rule Again, it turned out that the Irish wing of the radical party were not disposed to forego their opinions upon the great question of the hour, So it came about that after disturbing political circles for the best part of the week j the intrigue has entirely failed It does not appear that Sir George Trevelyan at any time agreed to contest the seat, and now that he has been made aware of all the circumstances of the situation there is not the slightest chance of his coming forward. Upon this matter some reflections arise The Times early appealed to the Brighton conservatives to do themselves the honour of sending Mr Goschen to Parliament At that time there would have been no difficulty in the matter. But the local Tories replied, and replied truly, that the seat was theirs, that the town was essentially Conservative in its feeling; and that however much they would like to see Mr Goschen in the House of Commons, it was certain that he would not sit with the Ministerial party, and that occasion might arise when he would oppose them All this, no doubt, is unanswerable , but the circumstances of the time are peculiar, and expediency seems to dictate another course. It is certain, at any rate, that the Gladstonians will not give way to any of the outcast liberal Unionists, and it would appear that the chance of Messrs Goschen and Trevelyan appearing in Parliament again is somewhat remote. Yet their help is greatly wanted At present the Unionist liberals stand between the country and the deluge They are numerically weak, but intellectually strong, and if Messrs Goschen and Trevelyan were added to Lord Har- tington, Mr. Bright, and Mr Chamberlain, it is evident that their influence in the country would he greatly increased The Standard tells us, indeed, that the chance of the outcasts will come when there is a vacancy or more in the ranks of the Unionists themselves, but this is in the highest degree doubtful At the last elections the Unionists only succeeded where they had been in possession before, the new men were routed wholesale Consequently it is not so clear that a Unionist vacancy will be filled by a man of the same colour The truth is that it is necessary to make sacrifices for the preservation of the Unionist alliance, and the sooner the conservatives see this the better chance will there be for the perpetuation and development of existing relations, The necessity, indeed, is great, since the Glad stomachs are incessantly seeking the opportunity of creating difficulty Mr Gladstone's letter to a Mr Brodie shows a clear determination on the first opportunity to put the Unionists in a corner, which shall make them either surrender somewhat of their views, or definitely cut them off from the Liberal party Other inducements will be held out to them to "come in" Only this week Sir C Russell told the Eight) Club, one third of whose members are Unionists, that he was prepared to go far to get their co-operation and that the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament must be completely and amply acknowledged in any future Home Rule Hill, the niMdious character of these approaches ought to make the conservatives alive to the absolute necessity of consolidating " the union of the Unionists." ' Tile position of affairs in Ireland is again acute. At the time of writing we are in apprehension of a crisis It is pretty certain that very serious steps are in contemplation by the Government, and a few hours may bring us news of the gravest events As a matter of fact, the Government had that they have now to take direct action against the National League The no rent conspiracy makes wa)s Every Sunday the agitators hold meetings in various parts of Ireland, to deliver direct incitements to an avoidance of legal obligations. If the Government is not to be beaten by the league, it is absolutely necessary to strike home forthwith The Cabinet meetings during the week have been engaged in the consideration of this necessity, and yesterday there was an important meeting of the Irish Privy Council at Dublin Castle, at which the Chief Secretary attended Of course the precise nature of the measures to be taken is not known, but the Dublin correspondent of the blun- da) d speaks of the proclamation of public meetings, of the arrest of certain of the lending agitators, of the suppression of United Ireland, and possibly of the National League itself The gravity of the crisis cannot there fore be over estimated It has been foreseen for months, as my readers will bear witness We have now a sufficient explanation of the withdrawal of Sit K. Hamilton from Dublin Castle I said last week that the criticisms heaped upon the Government in respect of this event were probably all beside the mail; It is obvious, indeed, that a man holding the opinions of Sir li. Hamilton could not consistently take part in the new departure of the Executive authority I have no doubt whatever that Sir Robert considers himself well out of his embarrassment, and certainly he does not suffer in any way in being sent to Tasmania He is himself sufficiently sensible of these facts, and has had) no grievance whatever As to the re- proaches of Liberal orators that the Government had made the under secretaryship at Dublin Castle a political office, the reply is that circumstances compelled them to the present action, and that the same thing was done in the removal of Sir E Wetherall m 1809 by Mr. Gladstone. There is no doubt that greater vigour will be given to the operations of the Irish Executive when they cease to be directed in any degree by Sir It. Hamilton. It is beside the question to discuss the necessity for this greater vigour if the Government declare for it. Whilst we are thus waiting upon events, we bear that the camp' at the Curragh has received intimation that all its regiments must hold themselves in readiness to undertake civil duties At the same time, too, United Ireland gives us something of a sensation. It tells us, with what truth we know not, that the Irish loyalists having got rid of Sir It Hamilton, are now seeking to eject General Buller from Kerry. The general was recently examined by Lord Cowper's commission as to the rent question Accord- ing to United Ireland, General Buller told the commissioners Some strange things The National League had been the salvation of the people, there was no law for them. The tenants were over rented and miserable The judicial rents in places were too high, and he had no confidence in the administration of the law. He had himself to interfere in one case of hardship, and he was in favour of some alteration in the machinery of eviction which would obviate injustice Generally it may be said that General Buller made a grave impeachment of " Castle rule" in Ireland. If it should turn out that this revelation has any bottom in it, it must create a great sensation It is noticed in this connection that Sir Redvers Buller has been spending 10 days in London and Devonshire, and that he only returned to Dublin yesterday morning. He has since resumed his duties in Kerry, and we ought to hear something as to the authenticity of the views credited to him at an early day I may notice here that General Buller's plan of watching suspected persons, in preference to having fixed stations with police protection to persons and property, continues to work very satisfactorily. This week the police have arrested a gang of Moonlighters, who were about to set out on a marauding expedition The ruffians were taken with all their apparatus upon them, and their conviction, which ought to be pretty certain, will no doubt have a healthy influence upon their fellow moonlighters Lord R, Churchill's speech to the civic deputation last week on the coal and wine duties collected by the city has brought him into trouble. It has had the effect of re- viving against him the old hostility of the Slanders!, and on Saturday this journal come out with a leader which must have astonished the whole of the Conservative port In spite of the express statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he spoke the mind of the Cabinet in regard to these duties, the Mandai d appealed directly to Lord Salisbury to disavow his lieutenant, and said that unless the injury done to the city were promptly repaired disastrous results must follow to the Conservative party. It went on further to discredit Lord Ran- dolph Dartford speech (us to which it confessed that it had previously spoken with too much kindness), and generally it managed to insinuate grave doubts as to the bona fides of the Chancellor as a member of the Conservative party The St James's Gazette backed up the Stan daul in its usual saturnine fashion. He is James's Gazette describes the speech as a painful display of pedantic ignorance, involving all the wretched fallacies of the Radical mob orator. Of course, nothing has resulted from this joint demonstration, and it is not a little remarkable that the provincial Conservative press do not at all respond to the attack of the metropolitan contemporaries. I ought to say that there is great irritation in city circles, not less with the matter than with the manner of the speech, which was very aggressive, and almost contemptuous The Lands] d is just now exceedingly exercised at the conduct of the Government, as are some other honest folk. The withdrawal of Sir R. Hamilton at the present moment is condemned by the leading Conservative journal as either unnecessary or as coming too late It tells Sir M Hicks Bench that he is highly blameworthy for keeping in office all these months a man who was notoriously out of sympathy with the aims of the Government, and that his departure just now is only calculated to bring the Cabinet reproach I merely mention this attitude of the Alandal d to tell you of the trouble into which Mr. Raikes has fallen on the renewal of the American and Gambia mail contracts Liverpool, which sends seven Conservatives to the House of Commons, is up in arms against its own friends Mr Raikes has determined to break down the mail "ring' formed by the Liverpool shipping companies, and, having refused the offers of the Cunard and White Star line for a tri-weekly service to the States, has arranged with two other Liverpool companies the Guion and the reconstructed Inman-to carry two of the mails, whilst a third is to go from Southampton by the North German Lloyds Company. It is put out in justifica- tion of this decision that the offer of the Cunard and White Star lines, by reason of the slowness of one of the proposed services, amounted only to a by weekly mail and, further, that the offer precluded the Post ollicefromusingaii} other ships which promised a more rapid delivery. Again, it is denied that the North German line is subsidised, as alleged, and it is declared that the ships, being Clyde built, are of the highest excellence, whilst the result of the whole arrangement is to save the country a very considerable sum per annum. It must be admitted that apart from the principle involved in using foreign ships, Mr Raikes makes out a very plausible case for an experimental chance, limited at present to three months in duration But Liverpool will have none of it, and denounces violently the whole thing It is alleged, indeed, that the despatching of letters by the German boats from South amp ton will be equal to a loss of 12 hours in the delivery of the letters posted north of Birmingham, but it is to be noticed in this connexion that the Manchester Chamber of Commerce actually recommended what has been arranged as long back as two years ago The real secret is that the Liverpool people fear the use of foreign bottoms for the mail service, and see lntheappearanceoftheNorth German boats off Southampton that fearful " thin end of the wedge " which may in time do them further mischief Queenstown, of course, has a large interest in this question, and a great meeting of all parties at Cork at the beginning of this week made much fuss under the misapprehension that the Irish port was to be altogether ignored in the new arrangement As to the Gambia mail, it is alleged that the Government have decided to withdraw a small subsidy given to a Liverpool line for this service, and that by consequence the service must stop This, it is said, will prevent english goods going to the Gambia district, and the French boats, which will carry the mails, must also get the trade of the region 'The Socialist demonstration on Sunday went off quietly There was an immense crowd in Trafalgar-square but the major portion were spectators drawn there by curiosity to see what would come of the talk of artillery, grape shot, ball cartridge, and the like, which had been freely put about As a matter of fact, the military were not present, All the arrangements were in the hands of the police, and there was a sufficient force on the ground to do all that was necessary even in the event of an outbreak of violence. A good deal of steam was let off by the orators of the Socialist party, but the bearers were not greatly roused Before the meeting commenced, a resolution which was to be passed-was sent to Lord Salisbury's house in Arlington street The deputation was received by the butler or footman, who told them Lord Salisbury was absent at Hat- field, and that the communication should be forwarded to him The police allowed the deputation free access to the house, but rigorously kept back the crowd, and the incident passed without difficulty When the deputation reported to the T Trafalgar square crowd the minister of the reception by a fluke), ' weather Prime Minister was, of course, the object of much abuse Since Sunday' Lord Salisbury has replied to the J resolution, declaring himself unable to take up its recommendations, and saying that the projects if carried into effect would do the working classes more harm than good. Meantime, " the East-end question can annually attracts attention, and there all sorts of projects under consideration for the relief of any distress which may occur during the winter The Government will, no doubt, relax the regulations controlling the granting of out door relief by guardians, but public works which have not a direct purpose to serve are, of course, quite out of the question Lord Coleridge is much congratulated this morning upon the verdict of the jury in the libel case concluded yesterday Mr Adams, the plaintiff, who, as you know, is the son in law of Lord Coleridge, has over reached himself The libel he sought to establish was in publishing certain documents sent to Lord Monkswell, the arbitrator in the previous case of Adams v Coleridge, which were outside the reference, but which the plaintiff principally complained of because they had not been shown to him. It was alleged that these documents had been sent to influence the decision of Lord Monkswell, but it was elicited from the plaintiff that he had had letters from the arbitrator saying they had not had the least effect upon his mind, and that if they had they would have prejudiced the parties who sent them. further, it was shown in the clearest way that Lord Coleridge and his son had no hand in forwarding the documents that they were sent in mistake by a clerk of Lord Coleridge b solicitor, and that the moment Lord Coleridge heard of them having been sent he wrote Mr Adams expressing his great regret The jury had no difficulty in finding for Lord Coleridge, though they somewhat strangely recommended that Mr Adams should have his costs, on account of the censurable blunder of the solicitor The judge naturally told them they had nothing to do with this, and entered costs for Lord Coleridge, the effect of the suit, which has lasted a whole week, has been entirely to re-establish the Lord Chief Justice in popular opinion With the imperfect knowledge which we had during the first trial it was concluded that he had been unduly harsh to his daughter and her suitor, whilst the revelations as to the economy of the noble lord s household did him much prejudice. But it is seen now that, in circumstances of great annoyance, he behaved with great fairness Mr Adams had no prospect of making a living and, spite of this, not only did Lord Coleridge permit him to thrust himself into a family where his presence was strongly objected to, but actually settled £600 upon his recalcitrant daughter It is generally asked to day whether any other father would do the same. Mr Samuel Morley s will shows the per I Bonalty at slightly under half a million sterling To the surprise of the charitable institutions they none of them receive bene- fit The whole of the property goes to the family, and Mr Arnold Morley, M P now becomes an exceedingly wealthy man.
