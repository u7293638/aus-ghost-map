[?] r- John Oaroeron, chairmau of the Queensland Meat Export and The Absentee Agency Co.^ ? Policy; ? rstriiB aresr -? ? — fliaf — THe' depreciation of grazing capabilities, droughts, ticks. rabbits, atad marsupials were responsible for the loss of 14,873, i«W sheep and 1^352,841 cattle in Queensland Jast year. At its cash value this wotold mean that between nine and ten miUionsof money have been lost to the colony ; or, rather, to the absentees who are in possession of the colony V pastoral resource. All this is very fine, but it would *-e more convincing to know how Biuch of this loss wa* due to overstocking and to the want of proper forethought in making sensible provision against disasters. It is the absentee policy, and not the drought and the pest', that is ruining the pastoral industry. All that the financial .syndicates trouble thena«-»lves about is their dividends And to keep up these their managers over-stock the country and cut down every possible penny of expense. Under these circumstances no provision is ; made for bad seasons, and when a calamity I comes it hits the industry tair in the eye, aul then the financial institutions begin ? yelling to the State for assistance. — The same state of affairs prevails in the sugar industry where Maxwell, the expert, shows I that the dividend -producing policy of the absentees is exhausting the soil and inviting pest and disease rather than forego a per wnt or two in taauuring it and keeping up its strength. State assistance to the pastoral and sugar industries in nine cases out of ten means State assistance to the ? aheenfrws — to pnahlp th**xn to keep up their t^_Me'n'_j_ ?' ♦ * # The syndicates who own the American ? railways embark upon trading, hik ing, and commercial enter Syndicate prises as wall.

Victoria, it crops up l everywnere. bast week the 2s. 8. W. Minister for Works called for a report on the subject, and this is what the Government railway engineer says : Generally speaking, I consider there is an advantage in the department keeping the management of the work entirely under its control: Men can be yn% on when- and where paired; material can be bought to the best advantage, and if delay occurs in obtaining bridge work or other material, the Government j ...« uu ^u,j«5uSS.uon to pay to a contractor Our experience with contractors has nearly ^igaj-fi-been^ha^ihey^mUM^xoibkaiit claims ior esti-aB ABdi^lteiations,and for compensation for damage and delay, and it has always proved rery difficult to show that the contractor is not entitled to a recognition of his claims. I have _no hesitation in saying that ifJhe Government officers are allowed a fairly free hand in the j management of the work, they get, v*ry good 1 value for the money paid away, and the work 1 comes out cheaper than it would under the contract system. The country gets the benefit of the profits, which otherwise go into the pockets of the contractor, and avoids the neces sity of meeting exorbitant claims. Experience like thts ought to be quite I sufficient to teach_people that with honest I and capable officers there is not the least] n^ce8?-t J for employing the sPfvfneB of any middleman contractor on any Government works.

In the first place they have equipped them selves with a splendid organisation here in Queensland. And they have magnified its strength and imnorfcanr-p hv taria,^*-;^.^ and affiliations with kindred associations all over Australia. So that a lonely squatter somewhere out in the Never Never, if he wants to down his employes, has the might and power of all his? local brethren, through | organisation, at his back.

If the workers would only follow on the same linen and organise, amalgamate federate, and agitate morejiersfstently, they could down the strongest organisation arrayed against them. Then by capturinir Parliament they could get that large measure of justice that in a diany^nje^ 1 state is altogether and for ever unat^H able. * *«. - 1 '; Baron ' Adolphe de Rothschild, who a short time ago reluctantly 'gavj up £* ghost ' and went to A Money. heaven (?) leaving tniHintm Krubbcr. of money behind himThaB simply paralysed a section of the inhabitants of the globe by his astounding generosity in bequeathing the handsome sum of one million pounds ster ling to the poor.
