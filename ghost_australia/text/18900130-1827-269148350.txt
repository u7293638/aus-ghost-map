Presently Finn put his head into the: compauion hatchway and;called. After "a little Mullin emerged. Wilfrid recoiled when he saw the man, turned His back upon him, and stepped hastily right aft past tlie wheel. I whispered to Miss -Jeiinings, "Did you .mark: thatT Each will go.in. terror of the other now, T suppose; Wilfrid because lie thinks Muffin mad, and Mullin. because he thinks that Wilfrid, should he get to hear tho_ truth, will shoot him."
