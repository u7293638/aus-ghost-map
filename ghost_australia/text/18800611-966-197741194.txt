The despatch encloses extracts from a let'er from the Treasury to the Colonial Otlice, dated February 12, 1SJ9, in reference to which Sir Michael Hick,-Beach says:—" I entirely concur in tbe opinion expressed by the 'Lord Commissioners of tbe Treasury that as the conditions of snuply of new coin have now been made so favourable it is iDcnmbent on the Governors of Her Altjesry's colonies to secure that tbe silver coinage is kept in proper condition by the systematic*! withdrawal of worn coin, and I trust that thpv will specially charge themselves with that duty."
