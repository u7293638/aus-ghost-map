ORIGINAL POETRY. THE GHOST OF LITTLE SNOWT CREEK. Of all the things that roam this earth, The thing wo dread the most, That silent, gliding, noiseless thing— A restless, flitting ghost. Now, o’er our creek a shadow falls— Wo have a “ presence” hero— A most appalling, ghastly tiling, That chills the heart with fear. With features worn and gnawed away By mouldering in the gravo. And a bony hand, still beckoning on, As though a boon ’twould crave. And in its long and ghostly arms A human form is pressed— A sobbing, moaning human form, Clutehed.fierccly to its breast. What does it want ? Why is it here ? And why that burden bear? Can mortal disenthral from woo, Or bring relief by prayer ? Has it a mission back to earth, To seo the wrong made right ? Or is it something evil, Thus to promenade at night? We cannot tell, because wo know Not why nor whence it came; But whether hero for weal or woe, Wodreod it just the same. G. Sintra, Eskdale.
