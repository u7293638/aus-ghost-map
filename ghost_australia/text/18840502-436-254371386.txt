He arrived in Adelaide C Â»time ago, and rode into the city on a donkey, with his hat and clothing and the ass's head b o covered with floral tributes. This eccentric conduct caused some amusement at the time, and f i the extraordinary being was greeted with C cheers and hoots by the assembled crowd. B Nothing daunted, however, he shortly afterwards appeared in the police court, and t i having obtained permission to speak, was beginning a long harangue when the magistrate, C o having interrupted him, said that the court m bad no jurisdiction in the matter. The man Hw then declared that during the last Beven years he bad announced to the world the very important fact that be is " the Son of God, the Christ of God, created solely by the K Divine Power of God, the Holy Ghost, for the purpose of accomplishing His divine purposes relating to the personal reign on earth of the K Lord Jesus Christ." The man has a few converts, and is trying to get assistance from the s M clergymen of the various denominations to hold n a public meeting. He lately published a book th in which he attempted to prove his identity, and he vainly endeavored to found a new sect. a w
