Mr. Speaker. ; 3Ir. Francis Conway Mason, the Speaker of the Assembly in Victoria, has climbed to his present height from very humble beginnings. Twenty-five years ;ago he was a young and quite unknown schoolmaster on board the reforinatory ship Nelson, in the harbour of Melbourne. During a general election it happened that the Attorney-General, Sir Archibald Mich, Q.C., had no. opponent in the constituency of South Gippsland. The young schoolmaster on the Nelson obtained three weeks' leave of absence, went down to the constituency, and canvassed it night and day. The Attorney-General, thinking that this Quixotic stranger had not the ghost of a chance, contented himself with addressing one meeting, and then returned to Melbourne. To his intense surprise, when the election returns came to hand, he found himself beaten by 30 votes. Mr. Mason has retained his hold on the constituency ever since, and has now been unanimously elected Speaker.
