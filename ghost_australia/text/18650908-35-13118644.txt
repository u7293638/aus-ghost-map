ThoCitviitMAN said that his first duty was to give a hearty welcome in the name of the Church, and for himself to those who had on this occasion favoured us with their presence, and with their Christian sympathy and regard In giving them this welcome, he was sure that he and the Church he represented were willing to love all who loved the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity He now called upon the Secretary of the church to read to the meeting a short report "Mr J Mu LINE then read a statement of the Church's progress during the last twelve months From this docu- meet it is peared that in the course of the past month the | Kel J G Fraser had accepted the pastoral oversight of the Church, which at present numbered thirty seven members there were the children attending the Sunday school held in connection with the Church, and they were taught by eleven teachers The school library) was well appreciated and it was intended to shortly increase the number of books Since September of last v car the debt on the church had been lessened b) 517, and it was expected that by the close of the month it would be reduced to a little over £500 the ordinary revenue, however, had fallen short of current expenditure The total amount raised for all purposes was UM 15s 11d The Cn UltM IN said he had to make some remarks about himself. It was painful to have to speak about oneself, though it sometimes had to be done, and now, connected as he was with the Church, he scarcely liked to say so much about it as he otherwise might feel it liberty to do He regarded the union between chief ck and pastor as of so intimate a diameter, that for a minister to praise his church was about the same as if he were to praise himself In looking back upon the past year, there was, as would ever be the case in reviewing the past, something to regret He looked back upon the first year of his ministerial work upon his own purposes but fully earned out-upon much impor fection in what he had with earnestness attempted to do, I and now he desired to remember the way by which God had led us all to humble UB There was however, very much cause for thankfulness and congratulation There was cause for thankfulness in the very existence of the Christian Church, and they would recollect that almost as regularly as occurred the salutations of Paul in his Epistles, did that Apostle give thanks to God on every remembrance of the Chut chests whom he wrote Though there was much that was imperfect and blameworthy, yet the very fact of the existence of the Christian Chun has as a matter of thanksgiving towards God, and it would ill become us now not to acknowledge it with gratitude The debt on the building, it not altogether removed, had been much lessened and would short!), we hoped, be reduced to a little over JCOOO but, tal Encourage from what had already been done we hoped that this sum would not be long in our way Returning to the system of ' weekly) offerings, the Chairman said he made no loud appeal to them, but had the fullest confidence that if they would but on!) with the matter in their own minds they would at once see the reason for the request that he made, and if each would determine to lay by in store as the Lord prospered him there would be now met in the means at our disposal This was the last opportunity that he had had of speaking to the church and congregation on the subject of the duties that he had undertaken in connection with Camden College His mustered brethren would bear him witness that the first year of a minister's work was not a light one, and the demand must be very pressing to induce any one to accede to it who already had work enough to undertake without so much labour in addition When he came to the colony he found the college may anent going on, and was desired to take a part in it He at first hesitated to take upon himself duties to which so much, responsibility attached, but after prayerful consideration, he had determined to place his forces at the disposal of the institute Altogether the strain had been heavy upon him, sometimes as much as brain and nerve could well bear He did not say this by way of grumbling, for that was an unchristian spirit when ever it occurred, and no one had a right to take a work upon himself and then complain, but he mentioned it for the purpose of asking them to bear with some things which perhaps might have been imperfect in him He preferred now rather to set before them some of the great truths by which every Church ought to be accepted in its relation to its munster. He had during the first year endeavoured to set before them the great truths of the Gospel-that there was Ono in heaven who loved and pitied them having sin with per feet hatred, and jet sending his Son to save those who were sinful He had preached of the Holy Ghost, without whose influence no soul was quickened into everlasting life, and be had exhorted all that with steadfastness of heart they should cleave unto the Lord He could not promise that for the time to come the geat themes about which he had to speak would vary much from these, and he trusted that the efforts he might make would be successful He looked forward with hope and with confidence in God much greater than when he began his labours among them He could see some difficulties had been overcome, and he believed that if they steadfastly persevered in the work of God success would crown their efforts and we should prove I flint our labour was not in vain Having such hope and encouragement as this he could now look forward to the future without much concern, for with peace within and no distraction without the Church might be made highly useful in the hands of God for training those within it to a holy Christian life, and in exerting a beneficial influence on those who were without He acknowledged with great gratitude the almost united noted peace and harmony which had ruled in the Church over since he came among its members No one who considered how very disagreeable a man might become a his little passions were stirred up within Lanchow easily jealousy and envy were excited and vanity mortified there was no one who looked within himself and considered these things but would find great reason for thankfulness that nothing had occurred to bring forth into fruit the root of bitterness which too often lays within He had known the working of several Churches, but he was thankful to say that nothing could exceed the peace and harmony which had pre v called here He hoped to at it would continue, and he saw no reason that it should not But we must look up to the Great Head of the Church, without whom no good would be accomplished, and in our great race we should remember that when once we lost sight of the goal to which we were passing vigour would cease and strength would decay We must keep our eye firmly fixed on the price of our high calling in Christ Jesus Our organisation might be as perfect as we liked to make it, but unless there be the hung waters to refresh the city of our Lord, our Zion would become a desolation and a byword among the people Though much of their former beauty and magni- silence still remained to some of the stately cities of the East, yet there all was hfelcsB, dead, and silent And so it might be with our Chun lies there might still be the outward form and shape of which testifies to what had been but, if the living waters no longer flowed all would be silence and desolation He trusted that we should always be animated by a consideration of the objects which he before the Christian Church on earth It was God's will that His Church should become a praise, a glory, and a rejoicing among men Difficult as was the work, it was nevertheless the one work which, amid all others that were carried on, would stand throughout The world was passing away, and so far as men's purposes were bound up with this world, they should perish , but he who helped to lay one single stone in the city of God was building on an everlasting foundation, and his work should never be destroyed The Rev S C KENT expressed the pleasure he felt in being present, and most heartily congratulated the Church on the union which had been formed between their pastor and themselves Good taste forbade him from folly ex pressing his sentiments with regard to the chairman on li to present occasion but he could not refrain from saying that their main ter was one whom we all respected as a gentle n trusted as a scholar, and loved as a brother i The tin ted that the connection between pastor and people I would be productive of satisfactory and eminently useful results Rd, might be permitted Roscommon them to guard their n master's reputation and to be mindful that the cab did not in his bin time Let them also seek in private as well as on alloce-anens by prayer and earnest effort tim he Divine blessing might rest upon his labours The Rev JOHN GUM AM felt unfeigned pleasure in learnt, (leper ( to night and was glad to find that this was not merely an unmilitary N teting but, a recognition service. He rejoiced that they had got a solid and an earnest him after if the Lord Jesus 61 restone who was likely to be a blessing to this suburb, in this city, and he trusted to the colony at large it was a high in liege, but it was equally a high responsibilty iii it they were ed spontaneously, de liberally and cheerfully, calling a minister to break among, them the bread of life. On great object of the ministry was the perfecting of the saints, perfecting them doctrine inexperience and in holy living He trusted that they would co-operate with their pastor in the work which he had come among them to do How might they help our brother in that good work? In the first place, they were bound to allow him to have the unimpeded and undivided exercise of all his faculties in the work of the Lord, and they should see that he be not perplexed by financial cares He would say to them, in the next place, that they should give their Minister time to attend to the new ministerial pints of his work, to study the oracles of God and to bring out treasures both now and old Let them not call upon him to be present at every public tea meeting at every ladies working meeting at every committee meeting which might be held for church decoration, for financial purposes, in whatever it might be, but let him have lane to visit the distressed and the dying, and to administer consolation to the bereaved He would find it his duty and his joy to visit among his people, though these visits would not be merely comply mentary but pastoral They might greatly help their minister by helping one another-by exhorting one another and looking diligently lest any man fail in the work of God -not in ccnsoriousneas and bitterness, but as brethren in Christ assisting each other to walk in the way to heaven They should have a care for the young, for the feeble, and for those whom their pastor could not see Let' them be regular and punctual in their attendance at the House of God, and let them help their minister by prayerful Byra pathy and by their spirituality of life, for pastor and people mutually influence each other in all their important relationships He was especially anxious that they should pray for their minister, and he had profound conviction from knowledge and personal experience that God heareth and answered earnest and believing prayer They had had additions to the church during the year, he rejoiced exceedingly in it, and desired that during the coming year they might be still more successful He trusted that his brother would have a long and successful pastorate in the Congregational Church in Balmain The Rev T Jûiirvfco«, wished to add his congratulation to the Church in regard to Mr Fuller, who he said was greatly beloved by his brethren in the ministry, and was worthy of their highest esteem He most fervently prayed that this monster would be over happy and useful in their midst and that the blessing of God might lost upon them The Rev VA SI, i v i it said that he knew well the troubles and vicissitudes through which the Church had a ised and he was noticed to ted that they had now come into such a position is back fin of great prosperity in the future He trusted that the Church would co-operate with him in every good word and work and that they would lend their energies to enterprises of usefulness He prayed that the blessing of God would most sound night's rest upon pa tor and people and would crown their union by the most benign influe use the Row Ii MvNsiiLiii next addressed the meeting He expressed sentiments of kindness and sympathy towards the pastor and the Church The Rev Mr BROWN would not detain them by any lengthy remarks but he was anxious to bear his mite of testimony to the talent and great worth of their pastor, and he doubted not that if his labours were fifty seconded by the congregation, the unstable sea and gratifying results would follow the Cn viRXf v> having made a few appropriate remarks, the Rev G How am I offered pi at er, and the proceedings were then closed shortly before 10 o'clock
