At the time the gas went out I did not hear anyone sliout-ing ' Murder,' or Ghost,' or ' Fire,' ; but thero wus plenty of shrieking ' Murder ' and ' Hoip ' afterwards. " The children, ran over each other, nnd tumbled ovor tho forms to got to the door, and somo oftlieglussin the windows wns smashed ; but I don't think thut anyone was hurt in tho room. " It waswlion they got to tho stairs that tho misohiof began."
