A Dream of the Great Western Desert. [By Kenneth Mackay in the Elector.] From matted undergrowths the fronded pines Shoot skyward through the hot December air ; About the sun scorched mulga silken lines Of cobweb hang in many a delf spun snare. Scorched by the fierce caress of summer heat The weary grass low droops its spectral blades, And dead leaves crack beneath the stealthy feet Of dingoes, gathering for their nightly raids. This is the land wherein the sun-god wakes The demon's dread of madness and of thirst ; The home of barren clouds, and phantom lakes Of goal-less tracks, and wastes by famine cursed. Here rot explorer's bones, and here too lie Leal-hearted mates who sought the lost in vain ; Here pain has birth, and here high hopes must die, Weary of waiting for the promised rain. When o'er these trackless realms the white robed stars Shine dimly as upon a death wooed place, And no fair moon shoots down her silver bars To kiss the sorrow from earth's weary face. Dread cries float upward from the dark set boles, And glowing eyes stare out athwart the gloom ; Each barren aisle is peopled with sad souls Moaning the gruesome story of their doom. For when chaste Night has wrapped her mantle fair About the dreary nooks where lie their bones ; The ghosts of this loneland, whose lord's despair, Fill all its caverns with weird monotones. By creeks, whose beds are littered with decay, O'er plains, whence fairy lakes allured their eyes, The spirits of the men who lost their way Come through the shadows when the stars arise. Then as they onward move 'neath star and sky, Searching for mothers lost, and widowed brides,â€” The souls of those they seek on white wings hie To be to them both comforters and guides. So, with the years, sad cries will sink and cease, And one by one the dead men will have rest ; Until at last a great abiding peace Will fill the vastness of the tearless west.
