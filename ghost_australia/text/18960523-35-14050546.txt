of action came again Franklin's mind returned to the Aust lian crisis he had so nearly succeeded in circumnavigating He heard in 1811 from Flinders s not a dish that another voyage to Australia vans

self runner ltd with the Arctic toy age of the Dorothea and front It is as after his second voy ago that he was knighted, then came a command in the Mediterranean, and some years later his Tasmanian appointment It is interesting to read her a letter from Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, congratulating Franklin on the step, and anticipating in his innocence an infusion of good elements into the infant society of Vint Diemen's Land under the influence of his management and character Later on the same distinguished correspondent suggested that if the Government w and make him a bishop or principal of a college under Finnklin'p governorship he would be tempted to emigrate with his family But his biographer gives a queer picture of public opinion in the Hobart of that day, quoting from the Ker John West's "brightly written and well informed History of Tasmania ' " for that purpose Franklin followed Colonel Arthur, who had made a host of enemies, and the lads out of a sailor in place of the soldier inclined to make the newcomer popular His hearty frankness made a further favourable impression, and he was received with enthusiasm but within a short while be sent home a favourable report of the results of his predecessor's rule, and from that time forth had to struggle with the prejudices of those who looked upon him as a mere tool in the hands of the Arthur faction " His first serious trouble vans brought about by his own private secretary, Captain Machonochie, who wrote a document criticising the " Jedburgh justice " of the lava as applied within the convict system Against the advice of his office his Franklin kept him in his post, and the writer says that the Governor had after- words reason to regret it But Mackonochie is known to have been a man of humane A Iowa, and those familiar with his Norfolk Island record would like a little more evidence before they join in the censures of Trade lm's bro graphics Still it is interesting to find here those echoes of past colonial history, of the early movements road aids constitutional government, and of the kind of life lived in the Van Diemen's Land of over 50 years ago To us, of course, the subject is not a new one, but to the English reader of this biography its interest will doubtless be considerably increased by the use made of a wider range of material than most biographers have at their command There is a letter here from Disraeli, in which he expresses a hope to Franklin that the " magic power of steam may some day, and perhaps soon, permit me to pay you a visit " When Captain Ross went on his Antarctic expedition Franklin was at Hobart Town, and it was from that place the expedition started The Governor naturally took a great interest in it, and we got here an interesting letter from him to Lady Trial - lin detailing the results of the expedition after Ross's return, and the biographer notes as a curious coincidence that the Erebus and Terror, on which Franklin spent much time as they lay on the Bornent before and after their return, were destined to take him on that last voyage to the Arctic regions from which he never returned We get here an account of Franklin's troubles with his officials, and particularly with Colonial Secretary Montagu, leading up to correspondence with. Downing-street, in which the Governor was told that his action was ill-judged and his action in regard to Montagu not sufficiently vindicated On the receipt of this despatch from Lord Stanley Franklin immediately wrote demanding the appointment of his successor, but, says the biographer, by an administrative blunder of which the vast absurdity almost dwarfs the monstrosity of the outrage, that successor was already on his way out, and actually arrived four days before the Governor received notice of his recall He left the colony in the midst of v sulking demonstration of public affection and friendli- ness A bitter controversy with Lord Stanley followed, of which the chief interest to us now is the light it then was on the fighting character of the man, and on the preceding few years of Tasmanian history Then comes the story of his lost Arctic expects bon Franklin showed a passionate eagerness to obtain the command The Admiralty called on him to report on its practicability, and soon after he received his appointment The fortunes of the voyage are too well known, so far as ascertain able, to need reproduction here It must suffice to say that the biographer tells this portion of his story in an interesting manner, and does full justice to that element of adventure m Franklin's character which led him to his fate The devotion and patience of Lady Franklin-of whose portrait by Romney Here is a delightful reproduction-also have justice done them, and indeed, on all grounds, the render may be congratulated on the task of producing this biography having fallen into birch admirable hands One curious story may be reproduced Before Franklin sailed on her last voyage Lady Franklin, who had been putting the finishing touches to a Union Jack he was to take in his ship, threw the flag over him as he lay on a sofa "Oh, Jane' and hat have you done" he exclaimed, and seemed distressed by the sailor's superstition attaching to the fact that the Union Jack is used as a shroud for those who are buried at see _ The old books are still lead, it would seem, and of making now editions of the classics there no end Ike Poems of animal Wordsworth are now beginning to be issued in the graceful Eversley series of Messrs.
