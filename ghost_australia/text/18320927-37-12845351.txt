AaX2B,XCAHT POETRY, BY W. C. BRYANT. (From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.) [THE INDIAN GIRL'S LAMENT.] An Indian girl was sitting where Her lover, slain in battle, slept ; Her maiden veil, her own block hair, Come down o'er eyes that wept ; And wildly, in her woodland tongue, This sad and simple lay she sung : I've pulled away the shrubs that grew Too close above thy sleeping head, And broke the forest laughs that threw Their shadows o'er thy bed, That, shining from the sweet south-west, The sunbeams might rejoice thy rest. It was a weary, weary road That led thee to the pleasant coast, Where thou, in his serene abode, Hast met thy father's ghost ; Where everlasting autumn lies On yellow woods and sunny skies. 'Twos I the broidered Boesen made, That shod thee for that distant land ; 'Twos I thy bow and arrows laid Beside thy still cold hand-. Thy bow in many a battle bent, Thy arrow never vainly sent." With wampum belts I crossed thy breast, And wrapped thee in the bison's hide, And laid the food that pleased thee best In plenty by thy side, And decked thee bravely, as became A warrior of illustrious name. Thou'rt happy now, for thou hast past The long dark journey of the grave, And in the land of light, at last, Last joined the good and brave Amid the flushed and balmy air The bravest and the loveliest there. Yet oft, thine own dear Indian maid, Even there, thy thoughts will eat thwart! stray To her who sits where thou wert laid, And weeps the hours away, Yet almost can her grief forget To think that thou dost love her yet. And thou, by one of those still lakes That in a shining cluster lie, On which the south wind scarcely breaks The image of the sky, A bower for thee and me host made Beneath the many-coloured shade. And thou dost wait and watch to meet My spirit sent to join the blest, And wondering what detains my feet From the bright land of lest, Dost seem, in every sound, to hear The rustling of my footsteps near.
