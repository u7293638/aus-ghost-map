He looked. up and saw two men enter, who at once set down the lantern they had been carrying, and proceeded to fill two sacks with the farmer's best malting barley. " If," said one of the thieves, " we had someone to hold the lantern up, we shouldn't be long." " No," agreed the other ; " wish we had someone." " ril hold the light for you," offered the sweep, coming forward politely. The men turned. Their hair rose on end at the supposed apparition. With a bloodcurdling yell, they both rushed from the barn. Not till next morning did it dawn on the sweep that the two men had mistaken him for his Satanic Majesty, or one of his angels. No more barley was taken from that barn.
