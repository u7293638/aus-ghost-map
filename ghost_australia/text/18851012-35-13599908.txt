I RAIN BERTRAM, the BLIND MUSICIAN of ADELAIDE. i -in. Adelaide is generally accredited with being a musical city organ recitals and concerts are of constant occur lenc/iindnov, that a professorship of music has been cartshed owing to the efforts of a very musical Governor, wholes succeeded at any into in making the divine art estimable, perhaps deserves some measure of the title Co of the most talented musicians in Adelaide is thus Goram, a young man scarce 23 years of age, who has been told) blind since his thirteenth your He is the only son - vi vng son of a merchant of Brunswick, in which town he was born He commenced the study of music a the age of seven, i ii four years later became a pupil of Herr Winckler, with a lion he remained for several curb, and under whom he studied the principles of that money, counterpoint and thorough bass, and acquired considerable skill as a performer on the piano and organ It was at this time that the unsl usefulness of an oculist con downed him to perpetual blindness Instead, however, of being daunted by his affliction, the young musician appeal to have been stimulated to fresh exertion He first appeared in public as a pianist when 11 years of age, and the follow - ing v em commenced his career as a composer At the age of 16 he passed his examination with credit at the Berlin Conservatoire, and about the same time acted as organist at St Peter's Church, Brunswick, in lieu of Hair Rebelling, who was absent for about a year In 1884 Herr Bertram gave a farewell concert in his native city, and arrived in Adelaide following year with his mother, who has since died Hen Bertram has been very prolific as a composer and may one day, perhaps, as to be styled the Schubert of Australia. He has composed no fewer than 36 sonatas, about half of which are for the organ, H nocturnes and romances, of which many are v cn beautiful, besides a number of songs, of which several have been sung in public A very good specimen of his style of composition has just been published It is a , descriptive song, called "The wind in the trees " The words are by Miss Holden, the daughter of one of the oldest journalists in Australia, who has been connected with the S A Register for a great number of years The words are excellent, and mo worthy to have inspired the music, which is saving a good deal After on ratio- , ductor, andante, a description is given of the wind sighing among the trees and whispering love to the branches. The ghost voice, with its arpeggio accompaniment, is in B flat, but with a change of mood comes a change of key the second verse, in which the wind is supposed to be uttering cries of vengeance, yards of passion," being in a flat, preceded by a brief passage con- force The accompaniment increases in difficulty, till the third and last verse is reached, when the passions and tumult of the preceding v or so are exchanged for a homelike adagio in A flat, faithfully reflecting the spirit of the following beautiful words " Deeph sobbing, said) waiting-, around the in and among the trees, Weena with so low, sobs with anguish as it blows across the seas Lake a Blnnor In contrition mourning; for his follies past And the vi saving trees make unit or, Hush, thou shalt find peace at last ' " The last v case, like the others, is was decided by a brief m troductory prelude, which in this case consists of a sort of money on the dominant of the new key in grave tune Much of the beauty of the song consists in the masterly manner in which are composed bus pom tra) ed the different passions by repetitions of the same, or nearly the same, musical idea, couched in different keys with varying accompaniments, and in varying tempi, from grave to allege the song has been sung in Adelaide, where it met with great success, and if any vocalist hero wishes to the anguish herself by singing a song that is at once beautiful, chaste, and perfectly new, we can confidently recommend this latest composition of the blind organist of Adelaide Although Hon Bertram only professes to play the piano and organ, he is also more or less at home with violin, flute, concertina, or double-bass and, in default of mi instrument, would whistle an accompaniment, which the singer would probably) prefer to the more elaborate efforts of any less gifted accompanist As an accompanist, indeed, he excels Revs make no difference to him, he is equally at home in them all He appears to seize the very spirit of the song, and wreaths delightful little figures and charming little passages round the voice, always show - ever, taking care to subordinate the instrumental to the vocal part _
