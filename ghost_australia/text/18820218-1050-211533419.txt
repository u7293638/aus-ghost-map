Chiming in -with. her. thoughts came; .that, weird, avail ; and, .tlie- long - white tresses, -and the icy touch, and i: the fearful speech . of tlie poor, wounded being, wore far too spirit-like for little Annie- 'to "resist their powor ; for she was— -could such' ar; thing bo imagined in" this very wise age ?— a' poor, weak,- timid,1 ;and;silly-, little-maiden. So she fell down, fainting, under the. tree, seeing not tlio weird figure standing over lier. And seeing not' Jasper Harrington, who had? returned to bid. Elijah Brown farbwelly as lie bad resolved on going to Dublin, to see if he .could not better his fate, with Lord Tyr- connel. " What is this? What ails her?" be cried, stooping to raise the girl, and gently lifting her In >his arms. , " Woman, ..what incanotli this rnad freak ?" hoarsely -.muttered- old Elijah, looking fiercely at the- maniac. - " Poor borly, she wottoth - not of iit,'.': said Jasper,-, moving away from her nevertheless, with hisfiurden. "Right - Jasper ; it- beseemeth- not -to -say hard things to poor. Mary ; God wot she ha3 been'sorely dealt' with." By tliis;time' Jasper had reached the door, and bending, so as to move Annie as gently as possible, he carried her.in, and laid her on her snowy bed. i'!
