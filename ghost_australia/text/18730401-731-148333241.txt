TBET. ( To the Editor of tlie Herald.) Sift, -^Recently arrived newspapers show that the dispute between the represen tatives of Australian woolgrowers and the buyers in the home market is as far from adjBBtment as ever. Indeed the latter have lately adopted a more de termined tone; and boasting of their onion and their numbers, already in dulge in clamorsuspseans anticipatory of the victory which they undoubtedly mean to achieve. Well, they may have the best of the fight, but their antago nist^ have the best of the argument, and ttaia, with yonr permission, it is intended to make manifest in the sequent. . Because English wools, from time immemorial, have been subject to draft, it was too hastily conceded that Aus tralian wooIb should be liable to a simi lar deduction, over-looking the fact at *\%m t.imA. that althoush there were weighty reasons for the allowance as regardB^British wools, there was not the . ghost of an apology for claiming it as regards Australian wools or the care Jfjfijr go* \ J^t $®?,9e wo0*8 °* ^e ^on ?

The difference, I apprehend, comes oat «f *fee pocket of the wool siapler, amd shoald fee quoted by him as a liberal set-off against the liberal draft conceded to him. Every wool-sorter, whetiuer engaged on Australian, German, r or English wool, is supplied with a small c«*k for bis -waste. Tbe contributions from' either Australian or. German wools ' ' do not till the tub once in a twelve month, whilst the English wool necessitates a veiy frequent journey to tbe pitebmark Inn. In the sontbof England, the excised ' pitchmsrkB are sold to the Kentish hop '?';' ]gri#e'rs, itnd every warehouse employing -? : from#ev«n to ten men TarniBhes annually * waggon load of weighty reasons of this sort for s liberal draft on English fleece ; ? ^iffpol. '* .'?',. ; Bat if there be abundant-and Bnfficient reasons for a liberal allowance in the *hipe ^ draft on English fleece wool, iol one ot them applies to Australian wool ; and the hQme buyer who advocates '??ih*»ftoh Australian wool because Eng luh fleece wool is subject to the earn disadvantage may be expected to discover, some of these fine days, a parallelism be tween a straight line and a circle. It may be urged that Australia pro duces 4jurry wool ; but this is a special affair altogether, and must be met by a special contract. The worsted trade will not be cured by a draft of 1 per cent, or anything like it. But pitch marks and 'kindred nuisances univer sally infect English fleece wool, and this is allowed for in a draft of universal application. At the last meeting of home buyers in London of which we have any account, one gentleman is reported to said, ' The matter was clear enough to all who would give it a moment's consideration, The buyer, in bidding for wool at a sale. In each bale there was a certain quan tity of moisture, and, to protect them selves against losses arising from this, it was nothing but right that they should be allowed the draft, which, generally speaking, only amounted to 1 per cent. Tbe elements of water are ubiquitous, and the difficulty is to say where mois ture is not, rather than where it is. It may be admitted, therefore that the Australian bale, when landed in London, is - not altogether free of moisture ; but that it exists in such quantity as to be a source of loss to the buyer we utterly deny, On the contrary, we are pre pared to maintain that the comparative absence of moisture from the Australian bale on its first arrival in England tends to the profit of the buyer — not a large profit it is true, but still appreciable, and worth acceptance ; insomuch that, if moisture is to appear in the books it can only correctly range on the credit side of the account, and not on the op posite side where Mr. Joachim has erro neously placed it. A nominal pack of loose wool in Sydney is almost altogether Ian a pura, all but free of humidity, appreciable or otherwise ; but a nominal pack of loose English wool in London is charged with no inconsiderable amount of moisture — for wool is nearly as absorbent of moisture as a deliquescent salt, and the humid atmosphere of England, up to a certain point, readily incorporates with it. The Australian bale, it is well known, gains weight on the passage home ; but when landed in London it is still susceptible of increment in the shape of moisture and weight, and will continue to be so till fully saturated up to the humid point peculiar to the lo cality. A woolsta pier merely unpacking and piling his Australian purchase will find on reweighing that it has gained in weight ; but had he sorted it right out he would have been benefitted in a still greater degree. By exposing a greater surface to the humid atmosphere, the weight would have improved in an im proved ratio. In most of the great mills in York shire the wool weighed in is carefully weighed out after sorting, not for the purpose of testiug the weight, but to as certain the sorts into which tbe wool has broken. This has often afforded the opportunity of noticing that Australian wools invariably gain and that German wools invariably lose in weight during the process of sorting. And this is easily accounted for. The foreign wool had been packed in a climate as humid as that of England, and, saturated to the humid point, the process of sorting had allowed an appreciable amount of moisture to evaporate into the drier at mosphere of the sorting-room. On the other hand, the Australian wool, sub saturated, was in a position to imbibe, and, like others in the same predica ment, all contributions of the moist description were thankfully received. Again, one woolcomber is charged with a weighing (36 lbs.) of Australian wool, and another, with a weighing of German. Both are expected to return, in top and noyle, the weight delivered to them. The Australian wool is in variably returned a little over, and the German, as invariably, a little under the weight given out. But the reason for this has been anticipated. So that it is very evident the purchasers of Australian wool in the home market, instead of losing by the presence oi moi&ture; in their bargains, get not only an ample quid pro quo, but something more, irrespectively of a very super fluous draft. In addressing a public meeting of those friendly to the continuance of the diaft now allowed, Mr. Joachim said : — ' He was well aware tLat in Germany they had recently been selling wool without any allowance for draft ; but were the buyeis in the largest me tropolis in the world going to take their instructions and regulations from foreigners ?' ? Of course, a gentleman rejoicing in the name of Joachim has quite as much right to contemn the foreigner as tbe kettle had to become complimentary to the saucepan on the score of their mutual nigridity ; but for all that, we cannot help thinking that the foreigner had quite as much right to refuse Mr. Joachim's money as Mr. Joachim had to refuse the foreigner's wool. If wool without draft is not to Mr. -Joachim's mind, he possesses the inestimable privilege of pleasing him self* and the foreigner needs not to be instructed as to his right to retain his wool when the terms proposed for pur chasing it are not to his taste. I have purchased German wools, both accommodated and fleece, to some con siderable extent, but never discovered in them the slightest apology for tbe impo sition of a one per cent, draft. They are invariably thoroughly and scrupulously cleaned, and packed with punctilious boneBty ; and if but a small sample be allowed tbe buyer in the German market, it may at any fate be confidently relied on. Though prone to sell the pig in the poke, the poke invariably turns out the mak ings of good and wholesome pork. Scoured handwaslied English wools, and staplers' and fellmonger's sorts, have always been free of draft ; and why the same description of wools from Germany and Australia should not be placed in the same category would, perhaps, puzzle the advocate for draft to say. Spanish and Foitugal wools are imported into Eng land clean and scoured, and why should they be fleeced when they never appear as fleece wool in the home market? Clipped in the grease, they are scoured after being sorted into four sorts. It is true the sorting would scarcely pass muster at Huddersfield ; but no attempts are ever made to resort it, and it at once subsides into broadcloth. Perfectly free from waste of every description, it affords not the slightest justification for the tax to which it is obliged to submit. About five hundred home buyers, we learn, have signed a declaration in favor of continuing the draft. This we must admit is a most formidable argument, and we fear that the sellers will be scarcely able to muster np logic enough to counteract it. But if they fail to secure the victory, they must console themselves after the fashion of the Sydney cricketers, with the conviction that although they lost the game they at any rate deserved to win it. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, W. J. St. Leonards, 11th March.
