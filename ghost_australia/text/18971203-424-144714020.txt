Widwut -delay Stuart made away from Hodgqki's farm to tbe station, which 'lie reached in about an hour. Walking boldly to die outer office he asked the warder, in a voice not unlike that of Phillips, for tbe keys as be wasted tQ take hit usual round. They were handed to bim without a word, and thesi the young man directed his steps towards die prisoner's barracks where, of course, the great danger would te: Hie first diflSculty which Coqfronted bim was the locale of his friend, Ayers. Qf coune through die machinations of me dead constable, the convict after fcis^mushment had been removed from dit pOKlticm *of servant and placed in one of the gangs. That included his ioMlteKiiee Item tbe hut to the main bamckswhkh were rather extensive. : ,|iick was decidedly on the side of S&art.; Acouple of warden were tn ttie long room, but not a constable wat to be seen. As the latter would, of course, know Phillips at a glance their absence was almost providential, and, witb more than usual assurance, Stuart began operations. One after another the doors were opened, and bis keen glance wandered around in search of Ayers. In the third dormitory the convict was found, and in a low tone Stuart told him to dress and follow him os the chief wanted to see him. . The first look which the convict gave Was enough to satisfy him of the identity of his visitor, or rather to give him the impression that the constable was no dther than Stuart. He considered that his former friend had joined the official ranks, and a sense of satisfaction filled him as he reflected that he would have ..Wft.M *''ion yhg. -;Xeadihg 't&e; convict ^uf the massive' door was shut, bolted and locked and the trap thrown open. Walking boldly up the long room with Ayers following, the two warders were passed and the barracks left The keys were left with the, chief warder, and then the two men headed in die direction of the officer's quarters. When a sufficient distance had been traversed Stuart extinguished the light, and said — ' I suppose you know me, Ayers ?' ' Yes. What does this move mean ?' came the answer. ' That you are free to escape, if you care to. I've killed Phillips and mean to take to the bush. Will you go with me?' The proposition was a rather startling one, and ninety-nine men out of a hun dred would have refused acceding to ?the request. The life of a bushranger was scarcely a whit better than that of a convict, and often it was far worse. It usually led to the grave, and unless a man had potent reasons for making such a change he rarely took the step. There was no hesitation, however, about William Ayers. His mind was formed in a moment 'Yes,' he answered, chivalrously, ' I'll go with you. I can't be worse off in the bush than here, and I'm glad you've put that scoundrel out of the way. You have saved me the job,' Ayers fiercely concluded. ' Let us get down by the wharf and then cut across to the farm of Hodg son. I've made arrangements to get a swag there, and it is on our way to the Tier. We'll not be noticed along the river-side, and you must get a change as soon as possible.' In five minutes the two men were clear of tbe station, and one of the simplest yet boldest escapes ever planned and carried out on the island had been achieved. Of course it gave rise to an official scandal and ' Ayers's Escape,' as it was termed, was the means of completely altering certain of the regulations in the discipline of the prisons. Attired in the convict clothes as he was, care had to be taken by Ayers not to be seen, but the risk was a slight one as the two men speedily left the station behind and headed for Hodg son's farm. It was reached within the hour, and the settler was found on the point of taking his departure for the station. It would be fully two hours before he would return, and that was considered quite sufficient start for the fugitives. The settler did not remain many moments with the two but set off on his hateful mission. Miss Hodgson had not been idle since her sweetheart left, though her heart misgave'her that he would not re turn. He had briefly told her of his in tention, and the idea seemed hopeless to carry to success. Gloomy as the future was the girl could scarcely re press her joy as the tall figure of Stuart' strode up to the homestead, and she was amazed to see that the convict, who was supposed be under lock and key, was with him. \ , A change of cftjthes was got in a few minutes, and then tt^e two swags which 1 , There Was food enoiwh to last ne&lya; month with that wfi^ ^tild easily -pir obtained in the b^& .'-l^'wo tmttra|j ai^a woe handed to Smrt,' ahd with the' other ehicles qotte a suttable kitr^u'1 the ^lack Fallv near the Tier, and btiog mu farther supplies,' ^abe girl jritiSerteHo Sti&tt-.;' ? u at very careful, or they nay follow you. You must be as cunning as a fox,' said the man. ' ' I don't see how they can suspect me, but I will take care not' to lead any one to you. Perhaps I may be a day or two later than I say, but you'll know tl\pre is good cause for the delay if it should occur. You must get away now, or danger may oome,' Amy said, and in a few moments the fugitives were leaving tbe farm-house and heading due west. Hie three assigned -servants were well disposed towards Stuart who when working with them had shown every kindness that lay in his power. In fact only one ot them was aware of the whole particulars relating to the tragedy of the.nigh£ and he was not disposed tb be loquacious on the subject. He would rather far have assisted the young man to escape than have led the pursuers on his trade. It was nearly eleven o'clock when Hodgson reached the station, and the commandant was considerably aston ished at the story he had to tell ' Why, man,' he said, ' Phillips was on duty an hour or so since. How could he have been killed when you say? There must be some mistake. Here, Stevens, go and tell Sanders I want him.' Sanders was the head-gaoler, and that official informed his chief that Phillips had paid the usual visit of ex amination about half-fast nine and re moved one of the prisoners. 'Removed one of the prisoners, eh ! Who gave him authority to do that? Who did he remove?' asked the thief, suspiciously. 'No. 84s, sir. I concluded he had authority trom you as he generally has, and, of course, did not interfere as I had no right to do so,' answered the head- gaoler. ' You should have seen the order at all events. I don't quite make this out Hodgson here says Phillips was killed to-night about eight o'clock, and if so, it was his ghost you must have | seen.' 'I didn't see him myself, sir. Wilks and Jones saw bim.' ' Send them to me at once. There is something wrong. Don't delay a minute I' exclaimed the commandant In a very short time the two turnkeys were in the presence of their chief, and when they began to explain the per isonal appearance of the supposed 'Phillips' the head of the civil de partment jumped to his feet, with a half pijpyi. V oj* ww ik « a ? -?* . ? 1- tip ? anddowri tfieofficein tvoaimable frame of mind I 'Who do you suspect of killing Constable Phillips ?' he asked Hodgson at last. ' I am sorry to say I suspect no one, for I know who the murderer is. That misguided Stuart killed him. We caught him just after the constable was dead, but he got away before we quite knew all that had happened,' answered the farmer, reluctantly. ' Ah ! That is pretty smart work. Why, he only got out of gaol this after noon. What was Constable Phillips doing at your place, Hodgson ?' asked the chief. ' I don't know, sir. My daughter was coming through the garden about dusk when he intercepted her and be haved very badly. He wanted to force her into promising to become his wife, but she managed to get away from him and ran screaming to the house. Her cry must have attracted the attention of Stuart, for when we searched the place with lights to try and secure Phillips we found the constable dead and my late workman standing over the body. He did not deny his guilt, but made off as quickly as possible, and I knew it would be useless to attempt his capture myself,' replied the settler. ' Yes ; be is a powerful ruffian and your lile would not be worth much if you came to close grips with him. He cannot get far away, and we'll soon run him down. But who could have come here to-night under the guise of Phillips ? Why, surely to goodness the scoundrel would not have had the cool daring and cheek to personate the con stable and liberate Ayers ? Yet, con fusion ! it must be. 'Of course, I see it now. He was sailing in the same boat with the convict and wanted com pany in the bush. Well, it is the coolest thing I have ever heard of, and there will be a deuce of a row when the news gets to headquarters. What on earth were you fellows thinking | about not to know whether or not it was Phillips you saw in the long room ? You know he has a beard and the man to-night had not,' he added, turning to the turnkeys ' He might bave shaved during the day, sir, and we don't know the con stables very well. Indeed, we had no suspicion at alL He had the master keys, and that was proof enough for us, | sir. Besides, he had on uniform,' re plied one of the men. ' Uniform, eh ! Where could he get that ?' queried the chief. ' He might have returned to the body of Phillips and taken some of his clothes while I was getting ready to come here,' suggested Hodgson. This was quite possible and probable the commandant saw, and as action was necessary a party was at once fitted out and ordered to proceed to the settler's place This was under the command of Henry, and the partly stripped body of the constable was proof that the missing uniform had been used to effect the liberation of convict 841, named in the register William Ayers. fTO BE CONTINUED.)
