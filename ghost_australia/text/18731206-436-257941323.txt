THE TRAIL OF THE SOPENT. BOOK THE SECOXO. A CLEARANCE OF ALL SCORES. C H A P T E R V I . THE QUIET FIGURE ON TUE HEATH BY TUE ACTHOK OF " Ladi) AftiUeyn Secret,'" " Aurora Fhyil," tic., &c.;, iC-c. THE morning after tbe storm broke^ bright and clear, promising a hot summer's day, but also promising a pleasant breeze to counterbalance the heat of the sun. This was the legacy of the storm, which, dying out about three o'clock, after no purposeless fury, bad left behind it« better and purer air in place of the sultry atmostphere which had heralded its coming. Mr. Joseph Peters,'seated at breakfast this morning, attended by Kuppins nursing the " fondling," has a great deal to say by means of the dirty alphabet (greasy from the effects of matutinal bacon) ebout last night's storm. Kuppins has in nowise alteied since we last saw her, and four months hnve made no change in the inscrutable physiognomy of the silent detective ; but four months have made a difference in the. fondling, now familiarly known as " baby." Baby is short-coated; baby takes notice. This accomplishment of taking notice appears to consist chiefly in snatching at every article within its reach, from Kuppins's luxuriant locks to the Jwwl of Mr. Peter's pipe. Baby also is poss^N of a marvellous pair of shoes, which are alternately in bis mouth, under the fender, and upon his feet—to say nothing of their occasionally finding their way out-of the window on to the duet-heap, and divers other domestic recesses too numerous to mention. Baby is, also possessed of a cap with frills, which it is Kuppins's delight to small-plait, and the delight of baby to demolish. Baby is devotedly attached to Kuppins, and evinces bis affection by such pleasing demonstrations as poking bis fi«ts down her throat, hanging on to her nose, pushing a tobacoo-pipe up her nostrils, and equally gratifying proofs of inlantine regard. Baby is, in short, a wonderful child ; and the eye ol Mr. Peters at breakfast wanders from bisbacon and his water-cresses to bis young adopted, with a look ol pride be does not at' tempt to conceal. Mr. Peters has risen in his profession since last February. He has assisted at tbe discover of two or three robberies, and has evinced on those occasions such a degree of tact, triumphing so completely over tbe difficulties he labors under from bis infirmity, as to have won for himself a better place in the police force of Slopperton—and of course a better salary. But business has been dull lately, and Mr Joseph Peters, who is am liitious, has found no proper field for his abilities as yet. " I should like an iron safe case, a regulai out-and-out burglary," he muses, " a good forgery , say to tbe tune of a thousand or two. Or a bit of bigamy that would be something new. • But a jolly good poisonin. case might make my fortune. £ If that little 'un wa6 growed up," be mentally ejaculated, as Kuppins' charge gave an unusually loud scream, " bis lungs might be a fortune to me Lord," he continued, waxing metaphyseal " I don't look upon that infant as a hinfant, ' looks upon bim as a voice." . The "voice" was a very powerful one just at this moment; for-in an interval of affection' -ate. weakness Kuppins has regaled tbe " fond' ling" on tbe rind of Mr Peters' rasher, which, not harmonizing with tbe limited development of Lis swallowing apparatus, bad brought out the purple tints in his complexion with alarming violence. . For a long time Mr Peters mused, and at last, after signalling Kuppins, as was bis wont on commencing a conversation, with a loud snap of his finger and thumb, he begai thus: ." There's a case of shop-lilting at H alford Heath, and I've got to go over and look up some evidence in the village. I'll tell you 'what I'll do with you; Til take you and baby over in Vorkins's trap—he said as how be'd lend it to me whenever I liked to ask bim for "it j and I'll stand treat to the Rosebush tea .gardens." - Never had the dirty alphabet fashioned such sweet words.- A drive in Mr Vorkins' : trap, and the Rosebush tea-gardens ! Kuppins bad been a fair; changeling, and had awoke -one morning to find herself a queen, I don't think she would have chosen uud higher delight wherewith to celebrate her accession to the throne. • -Kuppins bad, daring tbe few months of Mr Peters's residence in the indoor Eden of No. 6, Little Gulliver-street, won ft very high place in that. gentleman's regards. The ^elderly proprietress of tbe Eden was as nothing in Lis. eiglit compared with Kuppins. It was' Kuppins whpm pe^ consulted when giving his others for* dinner; Kuppins, whose eye he knew to Ijfe infallible an regarded a chop, either,mutton or pork; whose ^nger- was as thefin^er of- Fate In' the' matter df bard or -sdftrroeil -herrings. It .was by Kuppins "ndvice he purchased some mysterious garment for the baby, or come prodigious wonder , in \- the 6bape of a bandanna or a neck-handker- ' chief for himself; and this tea-garden treat he had long contemplated as a fitting reward Jpr jthe fidelity' of .his hand-maiden. Mr Vorkins's was on of the officials of tbe police force, and Mr Vorkins's trap was happy combination of-tbe cart of a vendor lelibeproviBions nod'the gig of a fast .young man of half-a cdnturygone bp—that is t< fay; it-partook of the disadvantages of each, without possessing tbe capabilities pf either: ' but Mr Peters looked at itwith respect,'and in the eyes of Kuppins' it was a gorgeous and faehiofa able vehicle, which tfremostdistinguised member of tbe peerage might have driven along the Lady's Mile.-atmx o'clock on n midsummer nfteftiaor^I^HtH'ijJifleand delight.

Mr Peters, armed with a formidable whip, mounted to his seat by her side, and away drove the party! leave the juvenile population aforesaid venting its envy in the explosion oi perfect artillery of jeui de mots. Mr Vorkins' trap was as a fairy vehicle to Kuppins, and Mr Vorkins' elderly pony an enchanted quadruped, under the strokes of winged hoofs Slopperton flew away like a smoky dream, and was no more seen—an enchanted quadruped, by whose means the Slopperton suburbs of unfinished houses, scaffolding, barren ground in building lots, ugly lean streets, and inky river, all melted into the distance, giuug place to a road that intersected a broad heath, in the undulations of whicb lay fair pools of blue water, in whose orystal depths tbe good people might have admiied their tiny beauties as in a mirror. Indeed, it was pleasant to ride in Mr Vorkins' jingling trap through the pure country air, scented with tbe odours of distant bean-fields, and, looking back, to see tbe smoke of Sloppertonian cbininoys a mere black daub on the blue sky, and to be led almost to wonder how, on the face of such a fair and lovely earth, so dark a blot as Slopperton could be. The Rosebush tea-gardens were a favorite resort of Slopperton on a Sunday afternoon ; and many teachers there were in that great, city who did not-hesitate to say that the rosebushes. ol those gardens were shrubs planted by his Satanic Majesty, and that the winding road over Halford's Heath, though to the io-oorant eye bordered by bright blue streams a*nd sweet-smelling wild flowers, lay in reality between two lakes of fire and brimstone. Some gentlemen, however, dared to suv— gentlemen who wore white neckcloths too, nud were familiar and welcome in the dwellings of the poor—that Slopperton might go to more wicked places than Rosebush gardens, and might possibly be led into more evil courses than the consumption of tea and watercresses at ninepence a head. But in spite of all differences of opinion, the Rosebush gardens prospered, and Rosebush tea and bread-and-butter were pleasant in the mouth of Slopperton. Mr 1 Peters deposited his fair young companion, with the baby in her arms, at the t m rate of the gardens—alter having authorized jer to order two teas, and to choose an arbour " —and walked off himself into the village of Qalford to transact his official business. The ordering of tbe teas and tbe choosing of the arbour were a labor of love with tbe fa ; r Kuppins. She selected a rustic retreat, over which the luxuriant tendrils of a hop-vine fell like a thick green cuitain. It was a sight to see Kuppins skirmishing with the earwigs and spiders in their sylvan bower, and ultimately routing those insects from the nests of their fathers. Mr Peters returned from the village in about an hour, hot and dusty, but triumphant as to the issue of tbe business he bad come about, and with an inordinate thirst for tea at ninepence n-bead. I don't know whether Rosebush gardens made much out of the two teas at ninepence, but I know the bread-and-butter and watercresses disappeared by the aid of the detective and bis fair companion as if by magic. It was pleasant to watch tbe "fondling" during the humble file champHre. He had been brought up by hand, which would be better expressed as by spoon, and had been fed on every variety of comestible, from pap and farinaceous to beef steaks and onions and the soft roes of red herrings—to say nothing of sugar-sticks, bacon rinds, and tbe claws of she!J-fisb; he therefore, immediately upon the appearance of the two teas, laid violent band on a bunch of wateicresses and B slice of bread-and- butter, wiping tbe buttered side upon his face—so as to give himself the appearance of an infant in a violent perspiration—preparatory to its leisurel consumption. He also made an onslaught on Mr Peters' cup of steaming tea, scalding his bands therewith, withdrew to the bossom of Kuppins, and gave vent to his in - dignation in lond 6creams, whicb the detective said made the gardens quite lively. After tbe two teas, Mr Peters, attended by Kuppins and the infant, strolled round tbe gardens, and peered into the arbours, very few of whicb were tenanted this week-day afternoon. The detective indulged in a gambling speculation with some wonderful machine, the distinguish- ing features of which were numbers and Barcelona nute; and by tbe aid of which you might lose as much as threepence half-penny before you knew where you were, while you could not by any possibility win anything. There was also a bowling green, and a swing, which Kuppins essayed to mount, and whicb repudiated that young lady, by precipitating her forward on ber face at the first stare. Having exhausted tbe mild dissipations of the -gardens, Mr Peters and Kuppins returned to their bower, where tbe gentleman sat smoking his clay pipe, and contemplating the infant, with a perfect serenity and calm enjoyment delightful to witness. But there was more on Mr Peters's mind that summer's evening than tbe infant. He was thinking of tbe trial of Richard Marwood, and tbe part he had taken-in that trial by means of the dirty alphabet; he was thinkiug, perhaps, of the late of Richard—poor unlucky Richard a hopeless and incurable lunatic, imprisoned for life in a dreary asylum, and comforting himself in that wretched place by wild fancies , of imaginary greatness. Presently Mr Peters, with a preparatory snap of bis fingers, asks Kuppins if she " can call to mind that tbere.story of the lion and the mouse." Kuppins can call it to mind, and proceeds to narrate with volubility, how a lion, once k&ving; rendered a service to o mouse, found himself paught .in a ^reat net, and in need of a friend-; bow this insignificant mouse had, by sheer industry and perseverance, effected tue escape of the mighty lion. Whether they lived happy ever afterwards Kuppins couldn t 6ay,.buf,lipd no .doubt .iliey did; that being the legitimate, conclusion of cve<y legend, in this young iady's opinion. Mr Peters scratched his head violent! during thiB story, to which he listened wit] his mouth very much round the corner; and when itVas .finished to'Jell into a reverie that lasted Jilltbedistant Slopperton clocks chimed -the-quarter before eight—at which time be laid down his -pipe, and departed to prepare llr Vorkins', tijip for the' journey.home. -' £fcrhapii'p£^e two- journeys, . the,.journey home wad almost the mora pleasant. Itseemed to. Kuppins' young itnaginBtion as if Mr Peters wa6 bent on.driving Mr'Vorkins' trap Etrai^lit into theswUogWtt/'i^i^'wBB'gowg down in a sea of crimpon behind a ridge of purple he&di.-; ! '8loppeft<m^in visible, except as a dark cloud on the_purpIe sky, This road across tbe beath .was jvery. lpnely, «|t every only^mct one grOiip of haymakers returning from tbeir work, and one 6tout farmer's wife, laden" with groceries, hastening home from Slopperton. It .was a still evening, and not a sound rose upon the clear air, except the last song of a bird or the chirping of a grasshopper. Perhaps, if Kup| ins had been with nnybody else, she might have been frightened for Kuppins had a confused idea that such appearances as highwaymen and ghosts are common to the vesper hour : but iu the com- >any of Mr Peters, Kuppins would have fearily met a regiment of highwaymen, or a essly churchyard full of ghosts; for was he not tbo IUT and the polico iu person, under whose shadow there could be no fear ? Mr Vorkins' trap was fast gtiming on tbe sinking sun, when Mr Peters drew up. and paused irresolutely between two roads. These diverging roads met at a point a little further on, and the Sunday afternoon pleasure-seekers crossing the heath took sometimes one, sometimes tbe other; but the road to tbe left was the least frequented, being the narrower and more billy, and this road Mr Peters took, still driving towards the dark line behind whicb the red sun wa6 going down. The broken ground of the heath was all a-glow with tbe warm crimson light; a dissipated skylark and an early nightingale were singing a duet, to which the grasshoppers seemed to listen with suspended chirpings; a frog of an apparently fretful disposition was keeping up a cap'ious ctoak in a ditch by the side of the road; and beyond these voices there seemed to be no sound beneath the.sky. The peaceful landscape and tbe tranquil evening shed a benign influence upon Kuppins, and awakened the dormant poetry in that young lady's breast " Lor', Mr Peters," she said, " it's hard to think in such a place as this, that gents of your purfession should be wanted. I do think now, if I was ever led to feel to want to take and murder somebody, which I hopes nin't likely—knowin' my duty to my neighbor better—I do think, somehow, this evening would come back to my mind, and I should hear them birds a-singing, and see that there sun a-sinking, till I shouldu't beaUe to do it, somehow." Mr Peters shakes his head dubiously; be is a benevolent man nud a philanthropist; but he doesn't like his profession run down, and a urder and bread-and-cbeese are inseparable hings in his mind. " And, do you know," continued Kuppins, it seems to me as if, when this world is so beautiful and quiet, it's quite hard to think there's one wicked person in it to cast a shadow on it's peace." As Kuppins said this, she and Mr Peters were startled bv a shadow which came between them and the sinking sun—n distorted shadow thrown across the narrow road from the sharp outline of the figure of a man lying upon hillock a little way above them. Now, there is not much to alarm the most timid person in the sight of a man asleep upon a tuinnii i's evening among heath and wild flowers ; but something in this man's apj ear.inco startled Kuppius, who drew nearer to Mr Peters, and held the " fondling," now fast asleep mid muffled in a shawl, closer to her bosom. The umn was lying on his back, with his face upturned to tbo evening sky, and his arms straight down at his sides The sound of the wheels of Mr Vorkins' trap did not aw/iken him ; and even when Mr Peters drew up with a suddpn jerk, the slopping man did not raise bis head. Now, I don't know why Mr Peters should stop, or v.hy either he or Kuppins should feel any curiosity about this sleeping man; but they certaiuly did feci considerable curiosity. He was dressed rather shabbily, but still like a gentleman ; and it was perhaps a strange thing for a gentleman to be sleeping so soundly in such a lonely spot as this. Then again, there was something in his attitude— a want of ease, a certain stiffness, which had a stiange effect upon both Kuppins and Mr Peters. " I wish he'd move," said Kuppins; " he looks so awful quiet, lying there all so lonesome." " Call to bim, my girl," said Mr Peters with his fingers. Kuppins essayed a loud " Ililloa," but it was a dismal failure, on which Mr Peters gave a long shrill whistle, which must surelv have disturbed the peacelul dreams of the seven sleepers, thought it might not have awakeued them. Tbe man on the hillock never stirred. The pony, taking advantage of the bait, drew nearer to the hejth and began to crop the short grass by the road-side, thus bringing Mr Vorkins's trap a little nearer the sleeper Get down, lass," said the fingers of the detective ; " get down, my lass, and have a look at bim, for I can't leave this 'ere pony." Kuppins looked at Mr Peters; and Mr Peters looked at Kuppins, as much as to say, " Well, what tlien ?" So Kuppins, to whom the laws of the Medes and Persians would have been mild compared to tbe word of Mr. Peters, surrendered the infant to his cere, and descending frcm the trap, mounted the hillock, and looked at the still reclining figure. She did not look long, hut returning rapidly to Mr Peters, took hold of bis aim, and said— " I don't think he's asleep—leastways, his eyes is open; but be don't look as if he could see anything, somehow. He's gut n little bottle in his hand." Why Kuppins should keep so tight a hold on Mr Peters's arm while she said this it is difficult to tell; but'she did clutch his coatsleeve very tightly, looking back while she spoke with her white face turned towards that whiter face under tbe evening sky. Mr Peters jumped quickly from the trap, tied tbe elderly pouy to a furze-bush, mounted the hillock, and proceeded to inspect the sleeping figure. The pale set face, and tbe fixed blue eyes, looked up at the crimson light melting into tbe purple shadows of tbe evening sky, but never more would earthly sunlight or shadow, or night or morning, or storm or calm, be of any account to that quiet figurelying on the heath. Why the man was there, or how he had come there, was a part, of the great mystery under the darkness of which be lay; and thatmystery was Death ! He had died nnparently by poison administered by hie own Land; for on tbe grass by bis side there was a little empty bottle labelled "Opium,"" on which bis fingers lay, not clasping it, but lying as if they had fallen over it. ilis clothes were soaked through with wet, so that he roust in all probability have lain in that place through the storm of the previous. night. A silver watch was in the ppoket-of. his waistcoat, which Mr Peters iotind, on> looking at it, to have stopped at 10 o'clock—ten -o'clock of tbe night before, most likely* Jiis hflt had fallen off,> and lay at a little <lislftnce, and his curling light hair hung in wet-ringlets over his high forehead. His face was .bandsomo, the {features well chiselled, but' the' cheeks" were, sunken and .'hollow, making the large blue eyes seem larger. ' Mi Peters, in examining the pockets of the suicide, found no clue to his identity; a handkerchief, n little silver, a few halfpence, a penknife wrapped in a leaf torn out of a Latin Grammao, were the sole contents. The detective reflected for a few moments, with his mouth on one side, and then, mounting the highest hillock near, looked over the surrounding country. He presently descried a group of haymakers at a little distance, whom he signalled with a loud whistlo. To them, through Kupjiinsns interpreter, bo gave his diiections; and ina two of the tallest and strongest of the men took the body by the head and feet ami carried it between them, with Kuppins's shawl spread over tbe still white face. 'They were two miles from Slopperton, and those two miles were by no means pleasant to Kuppins, seated in Mr Vorkins's trap, which Mr Peters drove slowly, so as to keep pace with the two men and their ghastly burden. Kuppins's shawl, which of course would never be any use as a shawl again, was no good to conceal tbe sharp outliue of tbe lace it covered; for Kuppins had seen those blue eyes, and once to see was always to see them as she thought. The dreary journey came at last to a dreary end at the police-office, where the men deposited their dreadful load, and being paid lor their trouble, departed rejoicing. Mr Peters was busy enough for the next half-hour giving an account of the finding of the body, and issuing haudbills of "Found dead, <£c.'" Kuppins and the "fondling" returned to Little Gulliver Street, and if ever there had been n heroine in that street, that, heroine was Kuppins. People came from three streets off to see her, and to boar the story, which she told so often that she came at lust to tell it mechanically, and to render it slightly obscure by the vagueness of her punctuation. Any thing in the way of supper that Kuppins would accept, and two or three dozen suppers if Kuppius would condescend to partake of them, were at Kuppins's servico ; and her reign as heroine-in-chief oi this dark roiuancc in real life WHS only put au end to by the appparancu of Mr Peters, the hero, who came home by-nnil-by, hnt and dusty, to announce to the world ol Little Gulliver Street, by means of tbe alphabet, very grimy after his exertions, that tbe dead man Imd been recog- ; nised as the priucipal usher of a great school up at the other end of the town, and that bis name was, or bad been, Jabez North. Ilis motive for committing suicide he had carried a secret with him into the dark and mysterious region to which he was a voluntary traveller; and Mr Peters, whose business it was to pry ! a b o u t t b o c o n f i n e s o f t h i s s h a d o w y l a n d , t h o u g h p o w e r l e s s t o p e n e t r a t e t h e i n t , r c o u l d o n l v d i s c o v e r s o m e f a i n t r u m o u r a m b i t i o u s " l o v e f o r h i s m a s t e r ' s d b e i n g t h e c a u s e o f t i n ; v o u n j r u s h e r ' s u n t i m e l v i e n d .

What would he say j to the absence of his factotum ? Who should tell him ? Every one was innocent enough, certainly ; but in the first moment of his fury I might not the descending avalanche of the doctor's wrath crush the innocent? Miss Smithers—who, as well ns being presiding divinity of the young gentlemen's wardrobes, was keeper of the keys of divers presses and cupboards, and had sundry awful trusts connected with tea and sugar and butchers' bills —was elected bv the whole household, from the cook to the knife-boy, as the proper person to make tbe awful announcement of the unaccountable disappearance of Mr Jabez North. So, when the doctor and his daughter had alighted from the fly which brought them nnd tbeir luggage from the station, Miss Smithers hovered timidly about them, on the watch for a propitious moment. "How have you enjoyed yourself, miss? Judging by your looks I should say very much indeed, for never did I see you looking better," Enid Miss Smithers, with more enthusiasm than punctuation, as she removed the shawl from the lovely shoulders of Miss Tappenden. '' Thank you, Smithers, I am better," replied the young lady, with languid condescension. Miss Tappenden, on tbe strength of never having anything the matter with her, was alwnvs complaining, nnd passed her existence in taking sal-volatile and l-ed lavender, nnd rending three volumes a day from tbe circulating library. And how," nsked the ponderous voice of the jondcrous Doctor, "how is everything going on, Smithers ?" By this time tbev were seated nt the tea-table, nnd the learned Tappenden was in the net of pulling five lumps of sugar in bis enp, while the fair Smithers lingered 111 attendance. "Quite satisfactory, sir, I'm sure," replied tliBt young lady, growiug very much confused. " Every thing quite satisfactory, sir; leastways " " What do voii mean by leastways, Smithers?" nsked tbe Doctor, impatientlv. "In tbe first place it isn't English; sod in tbe next it sounds as if it meant something unpleasant. For goodness sake, Smithers, lie straightforward and business-like. Has tiny- thing gone wronjr ? What is it? And why wasn't I informed of it ?" 'J? » Smithers, in despair at her iricapfbilityji^f answering these three questions at oiico, asno doubt she ought to have been able to do, or the Doctor would not have asked them, stammered out,— "Mr North, sir " "•Mr North, sir'! Well, what of "Mr North, sir'?" By the bye, where is Mr North ? Why isn't ho here to receive us?" Smithers feels that she is in for it; so, after two or three nervous gulps, and other convulsive movements of the throat, she continues thus—"Mr North, sir, oidn't come home last night, sir. We sat up for him till one o'clock this morning—last night, sir." The rising storm in the doctor's face is making Smithers' English more UH-Eiijjlish every moment. "Didn't come last night? Didn't return to my houEC at the hour of ten, which hour has been appointed by me for the letiring.to rest of every person in my employment?" cried tbe Doctor, aghast. " No, sir! Nor yet this morDing, sir! Nor yet this afternoon, 6ir ? And tbe West-Indian pupils have been looking out cf the window," sir, and would, which we told them not till we were hoarse, sir." " The person intrusted bv me with the care ofmypupi's abandoning his poBt, and my pupils looking out of the window 1" exclaimed Dr T.ippendi.'ii, in 1 n tone of a man who says —" Tiie glory of England has departed! You wouldn't perhaps, believe it; but it lias!" " We diiin't know what to do, sir, and so we thought we'd better not do it," continued tbo bewildered Smithers. " And we thought as you was coming back to- day, we'd better leave it till you did come back—and please, sir, will you take any new-laid eggs ?" " Eggs !" said the doctor; " new-laid pggs! Go awnv, Smithers. There must be some steps taken immediately. That young man was my right hand, and I would have trusted him with untold gold ; or," he added, with my cheque-book." As bo uttered the words "cheque-book." he, as it wtre instinctively, laid his hand upon the pocket which contained that precious volume; but ns lie did so, he remembered that he had used die lust leaf but oue when writing a cheque for u midsummer butcher's bill, and that he had a fresh book in bis desk untouched.
