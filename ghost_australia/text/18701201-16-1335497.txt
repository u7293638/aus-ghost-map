DONALD ROSS AND HIS CONFESSION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. ' Sir The last act in the Springsure tragedy has been played out, and the curtain has fallen upon the sad scene of the unhappy culprit Donald Ross, I say nothing Guilty and condemned for one of the foulest murders on record, he has gone into the presence of the Great Judge of all of the living, however, I must say a word The language the prayers of the Roy James Carson, as reported in the local paper, and in your paper, are sadly aw acting in Christian wisdom and prudence they must give great pain to all seriously disposed people, while they cannot but provoke the course lost and scoff of the world- long Standing upon the fatal drop, Mr Carson prays "Into thy merciful hand, O Lord, we commend the soul of this thy servant, now about to depart from the body Receive him, we humbly beseech thee, into the arms of the money, into the glorious society of the saints in Heaven Amen" Then, taking Rose by the hand, he continues " God the Father who hath created thee, God the Son who hath redeemed thee, God the Holy Ofwsl who hath infused His grace into thee, be now and over more with thee, assist thee in this thy last trial, and bring thee to everlasting life Farewell " The first of these quotations is not so bad, because it is prayer, however badly worded, the second is simply shocking and revolting to Pope or priest over pronounced such words over a mat derer, and no fallible mortal can truthfully pronounce them over any one " God the Holy Ghost, who hath infused His grace unto thee," on the lips of any mortal is fearful presumption, while the infusion of grace" 19 downright absurdity What follows is a fitting conclusion to the whole sad business ' Mr Carson thinks there is good reason to hope that Boss was truly penitent He trusted in God for Christ's sake for forgiveness, and acknowledged that he could not do anything of himself. He had not a full assurance of faith, but he trusted in God, and hoped confidently that God would forgive him " I do not profess to fully understand this jargon, but Ikuovv who it is who says by their fruits ye shall know them As this is not the first time (t ide Archibald's house) that Mr Carson has outraged the feelings of the community, I hope the authorities of his Church- if such there be will take the matter up The Presbyterian Assembly in Victoria a few days ago, as reported in the Argus?, were discussing the propriety of preparing forms of prayer for baptism, marriage, funerals, and similar cases They decided, however, against such forms Supposing, I presume, that all the wisdom of the past, all the wisdom of main minds, was not equal to the impromptu utterance of one man, young or old, wise or foolish Had they had the records of the execution of Donald Ross, and the prayers of the Rev. James Carson, before them, they would perhaps Jury of come to a different conclusion - Yours, to., SPECTATOR.
