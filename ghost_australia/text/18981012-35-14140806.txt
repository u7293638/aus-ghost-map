IN PARLIAMENT. of This session private members have fallen on evil days There was a time when the Govern- ment pursuing the even tenor of its way with the help of a thumping majority, could afford to allow private members to ventilate imposing abstract questions on a Tuesday night, and very frequently these discussions were taken quite seriously, and it seemed to the public as if the Tuesday debates were of real importance Now federation and the wavering balance of parties have overshadowed everything, and the business paper, except on a Government night, in the pale ghost of what it once was Even questions suffer from the interest taken in the national question, and yesterday there were but three poor little inquiries, where once there would probably have been 10 Without notice Mr Barton asked the Premier whether he proposed to define the procedure to be adopted by the Royal Commission that is to inquire into the conduct of Mr Young during the recent Hastings-Macleay election of Mr Reid will leave the conduct of the inquiry entirely in the hands of Mr Justice Owen The Government is keenly alive to the necessity of taking action about the city railway Mr Young has made up his mind to receive a deputation in a fortnight ' One may fairly speeds late upon what may be the result of this undue haste The deputation will be received in a fortnight , a month afterwards, no doubt, the Minister will have road through a precis of the shorthand report , a couple of years or so afterwards the Government should be in a position to propose something to the House, and almost before we know where we are in the year 2000 wo ought to have the city railway extension Thus does Time rush swiftly on, bringing its changes with equal velocity Mr Fegan moved for a select committee to inquire into and report upon the number of accidents in coal mines It was asserted that only 79 cases had been reported to the inspectors last year, whereas there had really been 1100 accidents serious and otherwise The Minister said that this was certainly news to him, and though he did not appear to think that the committee would serve much purpose he did not oppose it The Newcastle members in a temperate and sensible way pointed out the hardships and risks of the miner's calling Finally the scope of the committee was widened so as to put out of evidence being taken about all mines and to enable the committee to report upon the best means of allow tating the results of accidents This left the way clear for Mr Copeland to move his resolution about Sunday trading The effect of it is tolerably familiar He wishes to see the hotels allowed to keep open on Sunday during certain hours, and to amend the law in regard to clubs and co-operative stores Mr Copeland's intense conviction on this subject t is well known , indeed, his opinions on every subject are splendidly emphatic He never falters with J subject, never turns to the light or to the left " Nature, the great creator," he affirmed, never intended men to go about with an intense able thirst on the Sabbath Divine Providence, he insinuated, mented this gross outrage on natural laws How was it possible for a man to go out in the country on Sunday and enjoy the fresh air, and the flowers, and the sights and sounds of the outdoor world whilst all the while an intolerable business of the throttle distracted his mind and racked his body- ? Why should we live under laws that were framed in the time of Charles I, whose body was dust, and whose statutes and enactments should be equally as scattered He was sure that the House would now accept this reasonable amelioration of the licensing law " I bet it doesn't," exclaimed Mr Jessep, and Mr Copeland offered to bet a new hat on the result However, Mr Copeland put the rational arguments for their departure very fairly before the House. He dwelt on the whole sale breaking of the law that now takes place, the absurdity of pretending to keep up the farce of putting down Sunday drinking, and the partial manner in which the law is administered In- cidentally Mr Copeland was led lntorominiscenco, and he recounted experiences of his own, which showed that the law makes great distinctions in some cases it is a cardinal principle in a healthy democratic community that the poor man requires his beer No one disputes that axiomatic truth but Mr Cope' mi insists that the poor man with his beer on Sunday too That remains to be proved at least, it remains to be proved whether the Legislature will make the admission Mr Affleck displayed incipient symptoms of a rooted antagonism, but Mr Affleck, in Mr Copeland's eyes, is a hopeless anachronism In his vigorous phrase, he has been dead for 250 years, and now should be respectfully interred Mr Copeland's proposed bill has a larger scope than the mere opening of the hotels on Sundays He does not see why a club genuine or bogus should be allowed to keep open at all hours and sell on Sundays without paying any kind of license fee As for the abuse that might be heaped upon him for his course Mr Copeland oppressed the utmost disregard Parsons might abuse him, but that was nothing to him. He hinted that he could steer his path towards celestial regions without any guidance from the cloth in fact, that the guardian angel, remembering his services in connection with opening the Art G Ellery on Sunday, should at once grant him ready admittance Mr M'Leod, who is one of the official spokesmen in Parliament of the temperance people, said that he would not oppose the motion at this stage but this declaration, of course, does not mean that any attempt to legalise Sunday trading will not be bitterly opposed by Mr M Lean and his servants out ement time This Sunday trading question is a paying off old one, and never seems to get and forwarder " Some think drinking on Sunday is damnation, and others that the suppression of it is the rankest hypocrisy It seems well-nigh impossible to bring the parties together so as to arrive at a rational compromise At the present moment it is an undoubted fact that much drink mg goes on on the Sabbath, and as consequence of the surreptitious sales a great deal of bad liquor 19 sold, and that more liquor is consumed than would be the case if the awful traffic could be carried on in the light of day But these facts make little impression on the Sabbatarians The) will not alter with a principle they will not do so- for they regard Sunday drinking as an un- mitigated at it that good may come That really sums the whole matter up and the arguments employed during the debate for or against the resolution. Mr. Aiftich moved an amendment which would have taken away from it all its morning he may be regarded as a fair representative of the ultra teetotal party Mr Dight is another, but he is as well a keen logician It had been said that because Sunday drinking could not be put down it should be regulated-a monstrous proposition in the eyes of the elect of Singleton Suppose the same arguments were applied to murder Suppose it was asserted that because murder could not be put down it should be regulated ' This suggests a fresh flood of ideas (badly needed in regard to the temperance question It never seems to have occurred to anyone but the member for Singleton that murder being legal on six days of the week it is a monstrous anomaly that the rendition should be SO reprehended on the Hotenth Mr Dacey said that the Inspector General of Police had expressed himself in favour of Sunday opening Mr Barton was in favour of the principle, and asked that the motion should be allowed to go, without at all binding himself to accept the whole of Mr Copeland's proposals Mr Jessop spoke eloquently for temperance principles in their rigid entirely But it has often been observed that the extreme temperance advocates are the greatest stumbling blocks to any real] reform of the liquor laws It is their intemperance that bars the way Still, all these phases of the question have been beaten so thin that one might have expected that most of the aspects would have been taken for granted But it was not so Members can seldom resist the temptation of expatiating on the obvious and expounding the commonplace and here was an occasion where the obvious was more obvious than usual, and the commonplace more true than is generally the case Possibly this only had the effect of spin ring members on to renewed efforts in any case, the flow of words was interminable Mr Storey made the astonishing assertion that three- fourths of the publicans were against Sun- day opening Much similar reasoning was offered Mr Reid put the matter in a nutshell It is no belief or in Sunday trading , but he believes it would be much better to have certain legalised hours on Sunday than the present wholesale sly trading The present law " cut right across the grain " of the people's desires and habits Mr Reid quoted the opinion of a highly respected clergymen and temperance advocate This gentleman was firmly of the opinion that if the sale of liquor was permitted without any kind of restriction whatsoever there would be for less intemperance The Temperance members laughed scornfully at this idea , but, after all, if the obverse of on opinion is worth anything, the case of Norway might be considered in that country some years ago the sale of liquor was placed under a supervisory code Draconian in its severity As a result drunkenness and the sale of bad liquor hugely increase. A division WAS taken, and the resolution was agreed to Women's suffrage and the temperance question seem naturally to run together, and Mr Fegan's resolution was to the effect that the priceless boon of the suffrage should be extended to the "adult" woman He spoke briefly about the advantages of the proposed departure, denied that " woman is the lesser man," pointed to her intellectual grasp of " questions," and expatiated upon the refining and ameliorating influences she would exert in the affairs of the nation Mr Price ungallantly tried to block the discussion with a point of order, but it was not sustained Mr Carroll put the essence of the matter in a sound political light He does not believe that the time is ripe for the woman voter when it is ripe he will oppose the principle Mr Barton said he would vote for the resolution, without at all pledging himself to the principle At present he does not on the supreme advantages of the innovation, in any t after, the question should be taken up by the Government. Mr Barton confessed that one might be weakened in one's opposition to women's suffrage of late been so the ladies had shown themselves suffer and ardent federalists Mr Lyne urged that the Government should take this matter up, if it were taken up at all At the same time Mr Lyne believes that woman should have her vote There was a time when he opposed the proposal, but mature thought had convinced him that he had been wrong New Zealand has approved the principle, so has South Australia, Victoria was about to Because of this Mr Lyne thinks we are behind the other colonies. It may be hoped that we shall long remain behind New Zealand, and possibly if we continue to lag in the rear of South Australia we shall not thereby suffer total eclipse Mr Wood put the unfaddish contention very properly The lives of men and women are closely associated, and it had not been shown that women were suffering under injustice because they had not the vote He showed, too, that the extension of the suffrage to women in the other colonies had resulted virtually in failure Also that here was no real demand from women for the suffrage Leave was given by a majority of 61 votes to 5 The House then adjourned
