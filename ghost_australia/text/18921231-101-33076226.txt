THE STORY-TELLER. -? THE TROUBLE I TOOK FOR BEN. -*? [BY LOUISE STOCKTON.] (From Harper's Bazaar.) For generations our family has had but two trades-the women have 66 wed, and the men have sailed. It is easy enough to understand the sewiug, but when men, father and son, take to the sea, it is gener- ally because they live so near it that they grow up with salt in their throats. It wasn't so with us. We lived miles and miles inland, where there were no ships except iu pictures, and never a breath of ocean bréese, lot the wind blow from where it pleased. Yet just as soon as one of our boys WAS old enough to be put to a trade be began to beg for just one voyage first. After this, good-bye to shore work ! Ben was the only one who ever settled down on land ; and while I am writing this it is as like as not he is planning to be off again. But I don't wonder, for I should have liked the mariner's needle a sight hatter than my own ; but, being a woman, there was no choice whether I would be a sailor or a tailor. It is one of my comforts, however, that there is no mention of sewing in heaven. I could pot ap with the harp playing, but a long seam eu an angel's gown would finish me np as far as being in heaven was con- cerned. I'd never believe I was there. However, when my story begins I was at home all alone, aud Benjamin Ogdon, my dead brother's Bon, was off on his voyage. Bea's motlier had married again and gone West, sud I never knew her to do a more sensible thing in all her life. Ben stayed with me, sud I always thought, considered mc the nearest relation he had, taking, as he did, from his father's side. I wasn't lonely, although I was alone. We lived down in the village, and our house was one of the most curious, if it wasn't the oldest there. And it smelled of sandalwood and camphor and of Chinese spices, while all the others had to have dead rose leaves and French olovsr and such things. But my eyes bothered me. Twice in my life has this happened. This first time I was yet a girl, and my father WAS home, and I couldn't work, and I was low hearted ; so be|started me off to Pittsburg to see some cousins, and they coaxed me to go and see a spectacle maker, and he looked at my eyes and put a pair of glasses on me. Now you san believe I was as- tonished. I not only saw everything just as easy, but I found out something-I had never really seen plain in all my life ! I was so pleased that I bought a pair of gold glasses, and walked out of that shop as pleased as Punch, and seeing all the faces and reading all the signs, a Naturally when I went home I took np my trade again, and for neat and quick work nobody beat me. But utter some years my oyes got poor again. They smarted and hurt, and even with my glasses everything was blurred and uncer- tain. If I wanted to thread a needle I often had to prick my finger to find out whether I was wrestling with the cys or the point. And the worst of it was, I per- fectly remembered my grandmother, who was stone blind, and this made nie worry and cry at nights, and so make my poor eyes worse. HNext thing my work began to fall off. People would say, " Oh.Miss Lib, you are always so busy, and I was in such a hurry that I just took that sewing over to Hary Ann Hu ute r." And in this way Mary Ann's thimble was never off: her finger, and mine was cold half the time. It wasn't easy tu stand this. I had a little money as well as tho house, but it is poor providing when it is all go and no come, and that for a wo:nan with a good deal of lifo ahead of her. I was almost 45, and that is old or young as you take it. Old tor marrying, young to quit work. But what I could do I could not think. There was no sense in opening a shop when wa had more than enough, and everybody made her own bread and cake, and wonld havo been insulted if asked to buy either. I thought and I thought, but I only saw stone walls arise, and never a ladder to go up on. But at last X hit lt. Evelina Ropes said one day that her hus- band couldn't abide Mary Ann Hunter's vests because they rode up in the back. " Fd make them myself," said she, " if it wasn't for the pockets.*' " Pockets !" says I to myself ; " pickets !" Aud it is carious how wotn?ii do hate to sev? pock- ets. Oftou, when I have bscn ont sewing, I have bad to stop aud put a pocket oven in a eajico dress. I never had any trouble finding people j^adv to baste or make buttonholes, but jusFsay, " pockets," and then there is groaning aud sighing. For my own patt I'd rather put in a pocket than put on a braid, aud oven in a vest it is easy if you go about it right. So the very next morning after I thought of this Z put a sign against the window : " AU kinds of pockets made and put in." Everybody laughed at me, but I did a good business, and I took a great deal of wind out of Mary Ann Banter's sails, and ty working in a good light, and not all the time, I got on. It wasn't for one thing, half so much trouble for the mothers to cut their husbands' trousers down for the boys if the pockets were taken out of the job by some ode else, and I made it a point to be obliging. I was always ready to show a neighbour or give her a lift as wc sat talking, and 1 didu't always care to be paid iu money. Plenty of women conld give me half-dozen eggs or a pound of potatoes for a pocket, sud never thiuk twice of it, when they had not ten cents to spare ; and it was quite a joke to pay me. When 1 had got too many eggs or too much butter I could trade at tbe store, and get thread or sugar or something. So I kept busy, and didn't feel my days were wasted. All this happened-this second trouble with my eyes-when Ben was off ona two years' voyage. But when he came home tho first thing his saucy eyes saw, ns he opened tho gate and came up the path, was the sign,-HO.ho.opened"<4jje kitchen door and calls in, " Do you putulu pockets that are warranted to keep the money tight Aunt LibP" That was the first I hid heard from him for three months. Ancffce was grown old as he was-for Ben was 24 now-«and he was heavier, better looking, jand more, impudent than ëver. He Badoîtdiéou home1 many days before I found he was; worried about my sight ; and he asked more ques- tions than he needed about Grandmother Sawyer, and whether her blindness camé on sudden or-hy ilegrees; ~~He wanted me* to give np the pocket business ; but I would not, although, as I noticed how much more he could see than I could, I felt blinder thau ever, and grew lower and lower ia ray mind. One night, when I sat knitting a stock- ing-for this I can do in the dark almost, -he picked ap my glasses and pat them on. "You don't use these all the timer' says he. " They aint any UBO," says I. " Can you see with them, Ben ?" "Not a bit," say*"" " Ic isn't the f/L'^'of the glasses," I answered ; " becair t,ho better could bo bought ia the ci,v . of Pittsburg, bat I suppose they don't suit your eyes ;" and tb . the"*1--?v-eleventh time I told hi - ; . vhatTtF.d spectacle-maker said, au» -«~ ; <touished I was when I found I really . ever seen before I put them on. " But you don't mean to say," cries oat Ben, " that these are the glasses you bought iu Pittsburg f" " Of course they are." says I. "And you've never had them changed P" " Changed P" said I, ?'No, sir, I haven't ! When I find a thing that suits me I stick to it. I'm not one of the changeable kind, ranning after all the now fashions. And I've never trifled with my sight trying strange glasses." Nothing gives a sensitive and serious person a greater contempt for haman nature than to see people laugh when there ia nothing to laugh at. ' Ben was always frivolous, and he found his own jokes amusing, but really [ was now so oat of patience with him for the way he inst shouted when I said this that I picked up the lamp and went into the kitchen and began to set the bread. And as I sifted the flour I heard him gasping as if he was choking, but I took no notice of him. The next day he walked tn.and sat down by me as I was sewing, and without a word pulled out a pair of spectacles io wire frames, and handed them to me. I looked at them, bat I didn't touch thom. " They ain't pretty," Bays I. " Are they yours P" " They are good," says he. " Try them on, Aunt Lib." " No thank yea," says I. «« I am busy just "now." " It won't take a minute," says he. " Hours are made of minutes, and eternity is mado of boars," says J. " Do, Aunt Lib," says he. " I won't, Benjamin Ogden," says. I. So he coaxed, and I held firm ; bat at last I had to try them, because I couldu't stand any longer, and when I looked down at my sewing every stitch was as plain as a pearl, but I wouldn't have wanted pearls strung sc crooked, They were neat enough bat they stood on their beads. "Well?" said he. "Well?" said I. " Can't you see better with them r"' "Benjamin,"! said, "will yon mini} your own business ?" and I handed them back, and not a word more could he get oat of me. I was mad that ¡noruiog. But I was more tried with myself than Bea. Here I had given up my customers «od worried sick, and never thought that my eyes wera changing like every other part ôf ray body, and that what suited them eighteen years ago wouldn't suit them now. Still I could not forgive Bea for being the oae to find it put; and when I saw my old Bible that J had given np because the print was so bad lying on the table, with the glasses on the top, I never said a word, and for a week I dusted around them and never touched them. Still, as I never believed in catting off my nose to spite my face, I did finally go to Oliver Parsons and haye new glasses pat in my gold frames, and as I came out there was Ben just going by. He laughed, but I did not. There was nothing to laugh at, and my mind was occupied with more serious matters. I had to get my work back, and let Mary Ann Hunter hare a let up. I took down the pocket sign as soon as I got home, and waited Cor questions. As I waited, however, it struck me one-day, as I was clearing away dinner, that Ben was not the person to koep a joke to himself, and as he said nothing to me he must say a good deal to some one else, and likely enough the whole village was laughing at me. V Ben,"-said I, *Vb^MâryÀÂ.nn Hunter scared because she thinks I am going to : take mv work all back P" "I don't know," said he, looking np from his book and knocking the ashes out of his pipe ; " she never said anything to mo about it." " Well, after allj||| told her, it's , uatural«hs%boold.^^^^^ ^ " lO!)\ doesn't «PK any ^nipre than I've tolcW <', she'll stJjp easy and wake " And WerVs^imnees^Jaenox. It's a seven days' wonder that she hasn't been ov#r hagging me and begging me to make Jier-a^w^wn.'Vr >i? SET : " She'll'go Wthe day of judgment with herold ones for aught I care," said he¡ and with that he was np and away. It was jnst about two weoksTsftor tbie that pr. George ßilyß^r^J^m^Ses ' Yorky came to take his week's shooting ju tho hills, and, as asnal, went to Myron Bogers'; but when he found the bab was sick and cried all night he left thc nest day,, and Myron sont l&n;/to th« village to me. I never had takei boarders, bat he offered rae a Reasonable . sam ; and when I hemmed and hawed, and said I didn't see how I could, he sat as-if he had been planted, with his gun in one hand and his bag on the flooi beside him. He heat Ben for persistence and when at last I said I really would like to jknpw which he syanted most, tc come and board, ot to majce rae give up he laughed, and said that now he wanted most to come, ~i Ben was in Philadelphia getting spun money owing from his bjst voyage, but b wrote me a letter in answer to tho one ii which I told him the doo tor had the spar« room, and he said he knew a person whi used to say that a visitor was a nettle 01 a bash, but a boarder was a nettle in thc fist, bat he hoped I didn't find it trae. Dr. Sylvester was not a young -roan He was a widower, aap his head was i little bald, but he was a good-lookinj man, and his teeth were the whitest ever saw, so of coarse he was one of th smiling kind. And hs had a frank, joli; wuy, calling every one by name, and in manner as ff to say, " Oh, I know voa ar Mr. Adams and not Hoopes, and I at glad voa are Adams, because he is each fine fellow!" He knew everybody, and everybod liked him, but I wasn't fond of some c bis ways. Ons day «rhea we were-at th breakfast table he says : "Why do you clear your throat G often P" ? " I don't know," '-said I ; " because i fills np. I think." " Yes?" he said. " And do you koo the whole village does it P I never heat each a continual tbroat-coughiug in all m life. Don't your doctors ever do anythin for it*" "It isn't important enough to call doctor for," I said. " That's as yon take it," he answered " it is my bnsiness to treat throats, and don't want any patients who" are won than some of tho people hero." " What ought to be done P" I asked. " See a good doctor," said he, and the he laughed. «. Very; well," Ireplici.

" 1 am very much interested in parrots," said he, " and I'll buy one. Will you take care of it for me until I go home, Miss Libp" " i'll take care of all you buy from Ed- gar Lenox," said I. Af fer the: breakfast was all cleared away i I decided I would walk over and see Edgar Lenox myself. I wasn't easy in my mind;about several things.and I especially wanted no know whether Ben had written to Frances or not. It was a warm day, but there WAS a pleasknt breeze, and there was a good deal of rustling among the ¿eaves, and where- ver there was a patch of corn in a garden there] was nodding and bobbing as if some piece] of gossip was being whispered all along the line. I noticed that the poke berries were purpling up the stems and throqgh the leaves, and here and there a sumac stood like some splendid flower in Wooip all over. I took my time, for 'though having a boarder, not yet being much pressed by work, I was free to doss I pleásed when the house was cleared np And no meal close at hand, The Lenoxes lived) at tho other ond of the village,where theyjhad quite a little farm; but Edgar had pearly all of it in grass, because he was So often away from home.- They; had a curious Business, and they made à good deal - of money by it. They trained par- rots, but not for sale. Frances exhibited them, Wiien I opened the gate leading up the front path I heard voices on the west porch; and when I went around, there I found Dr. Sylvester and Edgar sociably smoking. " {rood morning/' 1 said. " How's yonr. throat, Edgar f" "My throat?" said he. "That's aU right. About as penal, Elisabeth." " j am going to talk to Mr. Lenox of his thro it," said the doctor, looking at me calna as a clam; "but just now I am grea ly interested : in his method of trail ing parrots." W e could hear the parrots very plainly, and a queer noise they made. It was talki og, of coarse, but not at all like bum in beings. More like monkeys, snp posii ig they conld talk, and I alwayejhd thing the most curions thing in Naturals' that (birds aud not monkeys or dogs nave j the j ;ift of speech. Yet it is just as well, beca IBO dogs bare so much sense that it migl t be troublesome if they conld say what they think; and as for monkeys well, we' do nave some of them as it is who tay more than they need. I had to wait until Frances got through the lesson ', she i as giving, ana it likewise suited me to ta ce the chair ^dgar offered and listen to tl e talk. I donyt suppose the doctor miad ed, as he took no notice of me, but wentfon telling Edgar things he had read and heard, and Edgar eat looking as if he was getting no end ef information, and was '. only too thankful. He always, reminded me of a ghost, because he always had to be spoken to before be would speak, and he never seemed to have any business in particular on hand. Presently the doctor began to talk of learned pigs. " res," said Edgar, who had one iu the bkrn that moment, but looking as if he hail nSverTieard pf "tBeift*"1* pigsTiäve" memory, but no sense. They can't reason, I believe. A little pig, you know, goes in and ont under a gate, and it tafees a good Ideal of squeezing and squealing after j a while to attract hjs attention to the feet ¿hat he can't always do it. I snppqse he thinks the gate has grown lower, or the ground higher. Bat à pig is easy to teach, because he doesn't reason, «nd bb does remember, so if he learns to do a fripk pne way he pan be depended on never! to do it differently.'' " Tjhe parrot remembers wejl," said the dootok "No, ït don't j that's a mistake," «aid Bdgak " for a parrot has a mind ljke a J slate.1 If yon want to write anything new\ on itf you must mfr off what is already IbhereJ But yon can make »parrot pat ?two abd two together, and keep its mern v in order. You say ' bop to a pig, ^?Litj says 'boo'to you j but yon caa 'boo' to a parrot, and haye it say ^?p '. jn return." ^^KTnat is,'' said the doctor, " a parrot ^Hnates ideas p birds do," said Edgar. " We have ^^^B all kinds of birds, my daughter ^^^^pecause we are fond of doing so, \ ^^^BTcan show off better with a parrot ^?Re of its speech." ^VBirds hnow," said I. " Nobody could. Hrsuadé me that they don't understand* Rannes; I've, known her to call them with those entons littie orietf she has whenJfchey'va^jocn fljing $u the tjrees, ind* they'd 'light on branches, and twitter and ?! chattejr as if they were asking what busi naas it Was of hers what they were doing," . f'liiainot think pf anythinjf more Tn. teresting than to see her training her birds," said the doctor, so, of course, Edgar got up, and we all went around the house to tba back porch, «here there was a window covered with netting opening into the room where Frances gave her lessons. When she saw me she smiled, and a pretty colour came iuto ber cheeks, but after that she took no notice of us, fixing her mind on her parrots. (To be continued.)
