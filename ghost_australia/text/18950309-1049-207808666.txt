The Bird o' Freedom Prize Competition on the V.B.C. treble, Newmarket Handicap, Australian CupandChampion Stakes, closed on Saturday last, March 2, and the' num ber of coupoiis sent in show how the Bird venture was appreciated. The task set our readers on this occasion was by no means an easy one, but although only a couple succeeded in selecting the winners of the three races, no less than twenty were successful in finding the winners of the first two events, the Newmarket and Cup while 70 picked upon Havdo and Tho Harvester as the winners of their respect tive races, but missed Laundress iu the first. Laundress was placed first for the Newmarket Handicap in 84 coupons, Havoc in 127 for the Australian Cup, and The Harvester in 259 for the Champion Stakes. T'hq successful pair will draw £12 10s each, and may have their dividend by calling round at this office at 11 a.m. to-day or on Monday. The names and addresses of the winners are as follows : — P.
