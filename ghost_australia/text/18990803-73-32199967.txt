A Woman's Hamlet. HOW MME. BERNHARDT STUDIED THE PART. London to-day is discussing Bern hardt's " Hamlet," which was produced before a fashionable and critical audience at the Adelphi. How came the great actress to build up her conception of the Prince of Den mark ? To begin with, she ignored tra dition. Kind friends procured for her at great difficulty the prompt books of fa mous Hamlets. They told her how Kean had read the part, the business Beerbohm Tree had introduced, even to the famous kiss he implanted, unknown to her, on Ophelia's tress of long hair after his repudiation of her ; the famous Henry Irving rendering : and of Forbes Robertson's picturesque reading, and his wonderful ending of the play. But la grande Sarah heeded not these authorities. For three long years she studied the part for herself. She realised it so completely that for the ghost scene she left Paris, and betook herself to her chateau in Normandy, where she paced the battlements in the moonlight, and mentally conjuredup before her the wrath of that dead King of Denmark whose behest she strives to comprehend. La Bernhardt's " prompt" book should be a marvellous contribution to the literature of " Hamlet." As ideas and inspirations occurred to her, while pondering word by word and line by line Shakespeare's most enthralling play, she dotted them down, so that her impersonation might be the result of long-sifted thought and carefully weighed contemplation. Three years' study grafted into the experience of a lifetime? And the student Sarah Bernhardt ! What an addition this to the Halmlets of the past !
