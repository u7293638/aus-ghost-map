THE COUNT "VON ATTEMS."-The Gladstone Ob- server has been told the following about " Count" Von Alterns, by a friend who had an interview with a passenger from Cape York:- The Hamlet's Ghost, with the spurious Count on board, put into Somerset (Cape York), on or about the 15th August. On being boarded by the police boat, he made inquiries as to whether a frigate had arrived there, and on being answered in the affirmative, be- came agitated and eagerly inquired about her movements, but appeared relieved when told that the vessel was H. M. S. Virago, and that she had left the settlement in January. He remained eight days, and during the whole time kept a bright look out for vessels in the offing. The captain and crew were discharged in consequence of a row between the "Count" and the captain, in which revolvers were drawn, The crew refused to put the captain in irons. It appears that the Count had kept thom in awe by threatening to give them twenty-five lashes apiece, when : he fell in with the Austrian frigate he was always expecting. The acting P.M. induced the crew to re-ship, under a fresh agreement, all but the captain and steward, who remained behind. While in port the Count was always dressed in the, uniform of an Austrian captain of cavalry, and wore a sword when on shore. He made a great display of the money he had with him, and purposely left bills of exchange lying about his cabin for visitors to see, many of which were filled in for large amounts, and only wanted his signature. He succeeded in imposing upon the authorities, taking supplies for his vessel and paying for them in bills, which the holders wi!l doubtless discover are about as valuable as drafts upon Aldgate pump. Among those who were swindled are two naturalists, one named Thorpe. The Count bought stuffed birds, &c;, from them, to the amount of about £30, but some slight compunction must have touched him, for contrary to custom he paid them half cash and half by a bill. He sailed for Batavia on the eighth day, leaving letters for the cap- tain of the Austiian frigate and his bankers in Syd ney! The frigate was ordered to follow him on to Timor. The captain be has with him is one Austin, late master of the brig Reliance, which was wrecked on the Solomon,Group,. He was picked up and brought into Bowen, whence he shipped as mate on board the Hamlet's Ghost. Two days after she left Somerset, the schooner Captain Cook arrived from Bowen with a warrant for the arrest of the Count.
