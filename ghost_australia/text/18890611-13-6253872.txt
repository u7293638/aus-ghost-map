LDI ron. Payments by post office order, bank drift, or Victorian postage stamps will oblige TUESDAY, JUNE 11, 1889. The Parliamentary business of this week will be confined to the Legislative Assembly, and must be mainly devoted there to the important question of procedure The Assembly has at last to make an endeavour to set its own house in order, with a view of lessen mg the complaints of disorder and obstruction that have so long prevailed No mechanical rules will ever stop stonewalling or the abuse of speech, but, on the other hand, the consideration that perfect success is not attain able does not justify us in continuing to make the way of the transgressor so easy as to tempt him into wrong doing Objections can be taken to anything and to everything, but we venture to submit that the bulk of the proposed new rules commend themselves to every fair minded Par lamentation It is not, it must be remembered, as if these regulations were local inventions, to be tried for the first time, and hence par taking of the nature of a lump in the dark. The fact is that they come to us as a whole well accredited from the mother country, and, as a whole, they commend themselves to the common sense of the reformer Much importance is to be attached to the rule empowering Mr Speaker to name an offender, and to suspend him for the sitting, because for the first time it clothes the Chair with some real authority The rule may be little used in public, and yet it may be most effectual in practice, for it will enable Mr Speaker to give offenders private warning that they must curb extravagances, or else must be held up to opprobrium as having so disgraced the House as to merit temporary expulsion The proposal to sweep away a number of formal questions that have now to be put from the Chair will also commend itself At each stage of a measure we want to get as near to a plain yes or no as is possible bona-fide discussion may be anticipated with regard to the new rule No 3 dealing with motions for adjournments of the House, with regard to rule No 17 relating to the closure and with regard to rule No having reference to the suspension of the standing orders As regards the adjournment of the House, it is a moot question whether instead of requiring half the number of members present to make the demand, the quorum of 20 should not suffice as an experiment As regards the closure, we need only remark that if the choice should be between the Government proposal and a scheme for regularly naming the days when bills should come up for a vote, the former is far preferable Under the latter scheme the allotted four, five, or six days might be consumed by long winded speakers of the majority, and the minority would be excluded without anyone being answerable for the suppression of free debate The closure does give us a vote on the question of discussion or no discussion at the particular stage when a vote could be intelligently taken, and members would have to take the responsibility of the division , while under the other system there would be an arbitrary and effectual closure without any direct responsibility for the action A majority could exercise this particular development of the power with a maximum of effect and a minimum of personal odium Lengthy debates can be best dealt with by the House bringing a time rule into force, but the next best mode is undoubtedly the Government proposal Here the consent of Mr. Speaker has to be obtained, and though, as we have said before, that can sentisnotevory thing, yet it is something The closure, we would urge, can afford to stand over for a session in order that local experience may be gathered of the other rules, but if there is to be a closure, the Government scheme is by no means so offensive as some of the other systems that have been named The rule dealing with the standing orders naturally challenges attention, and it may be said of it that it has already provoked a good deal of criticism We publish today letter from Mr PeouLiu HUH LI, which deserves to be read with care, coming as it does from an old member who paid great attention to the question of procedure, and who speaks impartially from an outside position His view is the one which is commonly urged in conversation in political circles The dist portion of the rule leads - "That any standing order may be suspended by the leave of the House ' This, as Mr. HARPER says, leaves the practice of the Assembly as it is that is, if the House is unanimous, the standing orders can be suspended without notice, and if a single member objects notice must be given, whereupon they can be suspended by the motion being carried by a bare majority The second part contains an innovation The rule reads " In cases of urgent necessity, any stand IIIR order or orders of the House may be BUB pended on motion duly made and seconded without notice, no amendment or debate being allowed thereon, provided that such motion has the concurrence of an absolute majority of the whole of the members of the Legislative Assembly " Mr I√èAiii'Fit urges that this proposal sweeps away the rights and liberties already existing, by which a minority can prevent standing orders being suspended on the instant, and thus enables a minority to run not as it pleases Such is the general remark But there is some misapprehension here. Our correspondent must have forgot ten standing order No. 257, which stands : " tells of an urgent nature may be passed with unusual expedition through their several stages." . ... / And this rule is commonly exercised. It is the instrument by means of which bills are rapidly proceeded with during the' last days of the session, the measures, as the records of the day testify, going through on these occasions with an almost incredible swift- ness. The Speaker certifies to urgency, and the chance majority present-a majority, it may be, and it has been, of only 11 in a House of 21-suspends all the standing orders, and enables the bill to be put through second reading, committee, report, and third reading in both Houses in an evening. The check on abuse which has been found effectual is the Speaker's certificate of urgency because Air. Speaker has always to decide this issue-and the circumstance that the minority if it is determined can still fight each stage and so block the measure for the time being. It is obvious that the new power now proposed to be taken with regard to general business is a very feeble weapon indeed in comparison to that with regard to bills which is now in regular use. The suspension of the standing orders is asked for ninety-nine times out of a hundred with regard to bills, inasmuch as a motion is voted upon once and is dealt with; and if Mr, HARPER had remembered that bills are specially provided for, we scarcely think he would have challenged the new proposition. At any rate, in view of the existence of rule No. 257, this new standing order is a matter of but small moment. The footing upon which the right to move the adjournment of the debate stands is an issue of more concern, and the " The " question of the day is the closure. The prolonged drought of the past summer served to direct public attention to the natural causes of such phenomena and a good many theories of a more or less ingenious character were forthcoming by way of explanation. At the present moment the recent floods in New South Wales, and the far more terrible disaster just announced from the United States, have brought into prominence the correlative question of excessive rainfall and its causes. In recent numbers of a New South Wales publication Mr. CHARLES EGESON has some remarks upon the peculiarities of the Australian climate and the causes of droughts and floods, which in view of late events will be found of considerable general interest. It is a pity that the inquiry into occurrences of this kind can hardly for some time at any rate, be looked upon as anything more than interesting merely. In some cases, no doubt, it would be of great practical use to be able to foretell with substantial accuracy the nature of the coming season. If a drought were seen to be inevitable, stocks would be kept low, and every conceivable means resorted to for making the most of what water was to be had. If, on the other hand, things pointed plainly to excessive rains, certain crops would be substituted for others, dams and reservoirs would be looked to low-lying sites near watercourses would be abandoned or avoided, and everything made as snug as possible in view of coming events. Yet, even then, in a large majority of cases, probably nothing that could, or at any rate would be done by men would be of much avail against the vast forces that nature has at her disposal. It is just possible that the terrible disaster that has befallen Pennsylvania might have been avoided altogether, if the reservoir, which apparently was known to be unsafe, had been kept in proper repair. But the waterspout, that was the immediate cause of the disaster, could hardly have been predicted and even if the inhabitants had been forewarned of it, such is the vis inertia of human nature that it by no means follows that they would have profited by the warning. In fact, from the report which we have received, it seems that prior to the catastrophe the citizens of Johnstown had been made aware of the danger in which they stood. But as many others in a similar position have done before, and will doubtless do again, they disbelieved or dis- regarded the warning. Undeterred by the fate of Herculaneum and Pompeii, people still continue to build houses and towns under the shadow of Vesuvius. And in all ages and countries alike it is found next to impossible to impress upon the average man a due appreciation of danger until the danger is actually upon him, and can no longer be escaped. At present, however, so imperfect is human knowledge of meteorological phenomena, that no one is quite in a position to issue predictions with the authority necessary even to make it likely that they will be acted upon. Mr. EGESON'S explanations are extremely interesting, and his remarks aboutcyclonosand anti-cyclone, and their effects upon climate, will be read with attention and pleasure. During the summer, it seems, when the water is colder than the land, a large and cyclonic area, or mass of falling air, lies over the South Pacific Ocean ; while over the continent of Australia, which is hotter than the sea, the air is rising, or in other words, the conditions are cyclonic. In the winter this state of things is reversed, the sea becomes the seat of the cyclonic area, and the land that of the anti-cyclonic area. In the action upon each other of these two antagonistic bodies lies the explanation of the atmospheric phenomena with which we are all familiar. A storm is thus satisfactorily accounted for, on much the same principle as that which underlies the well-known definition of a railway collision, by an attempt on the part of a cycle and an anti-cyclone to pass one another on the same line of rails. Similarly Mr. EGESON, in common with other meteorologists, is inclined to connect sun-spots with weather : " with " a wave of sun-spots, which means in " crossed solar heat we have a wave of low pressure, and with this a wave " of rain." It is interesting to hear of relations being established in this way between the rains which fall at times so heavily over our continent and certain changes taking place in the photosphere of the sun, some 05 millions of miles away ; though even then there are, it appears' local influences" ready to stop in and bring about some result directly contrary to that which ought by rights to happen. But from another point of view, something almost akin to dis- couragement may be found to follow the advance of human knowledge in this direction. In the old pagan ' days, ZEUS, and JECtS, and THOR, and their fellows, disposed of the weather as they liked, according to their own wishes and tastes. It is of little use one may think, to have got rid of these personal meteorological agencies, which could at any rate be propitiated by prayer and sacrifice, merely in order to substitute for them vast impersonal forces, equally uncontrollable, and not to be turned aside by anything that man can say or do. Of what avail is it to know that droughts and floods are connected with cyclones and anti cyclones and sun spots, when the fact of knowing this does not confer upon man any more power of regulating those conditions than he possessed over the deities of the pagan mythology. One statement, however, made by Mr. EGESON will be regarded with doubt and surprise. He dismisses as quite. untenable the popular belief that the destruction of forests tends to make the rainfall less. On the contrary, the process, he declares, has quite the opposite effect. All vegetation in general and Australian trees in particular absorb large quantities of water consequently their destruction restores this amount of moisture to the earth. This according to Mr. EGESON, has been established by a mass of practical proof that cannot be gainsaid. At the same time the assumed refutation of this supposed fallacy must not, the writer points out, be taken as an argument in favour of the denudation of the continent. Many persons hold that, though " deforestation " (to use an ill-sounding but convenient phrase) may not diminish the rainfall, it serves to make the effects of an excessive rain very much more severe Forests and their undergrowth in this view act as a sort of sponge, which arrest and mitigate the force of a heavy rainfall, Without this absorbing and filter- ing medium, storms of water fall upon the bare soil, and rush over its surface in the shape of devour- ing floods. For this, as well as for other obvious reasons, the destruction of forests should be indulged in only where it is necessary for clearing the land. It is highly probable that many people in Melbourne were only made aware of the existence of what is called I Whit Monday by the fact that the banks closed their doors yesterday, and put the general trade of the city to inconvenience Yet in England for a number of centuries this was pre-eminently a season of mirth and merriment, of dancing and outdoor sports, and to the present day it is still widely and enthusiastically observed Even in Scotland, where church festivals are regarded as superstitions to be avoided, the Whitsuntide forms even now an important period of the year Religious traditions and natural circumstances have combined to make it a most suitable time for holidays on the northern side of the line intended to commemorate that unforgettable feast of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost descended upon the disciples its sacred associations fell in the period of the spring time, when popular amusements naturally followed the more solemn rites of the religious services with which it was celebrated And at the present moment, when the religious signification is largely forgotten, the natural fitness of the season remains It is in the end of May that blossom and leaf and flower are showing in rich and varied profusion among the woods and hedgerows and fields of the English counties, in May that the hard toil of sowing and planting is finished, and the inhabitants of the rural districts can watch the growth of their crops, and look forward to the harvest and the ingathering In early times spring festivals were universal throughout the An an races, from the Greeks to the Goths, and upon the introduction of Christianity they were simply continued with a new meaning At Whitsuntide the knights of the middle ages held their tournaments at the same season the morris dance donned their caps and bells and pranced in the village squares while strong Whitsun ale was drunk for the benefit of the body and of the parish church, which derived a revenue from it With dances and dramatic representations the festivity, though it commemorated a solemn event in religious history, was essentially popular Ivow, however, the sacredness of "Whit HOWEver, LHU √∂ucicuii_--> u. Monday and the other days of the Whitsunday week has been so completely obscured, that there are many who hardly know what they signify. Christmas and Easter are the church festivals which are distinctly associated with religious ordinances and dear tional thoughts and expressions of good will to men, while the Whitsuntide seems to be dropping out of view like the saints' days and the other special seasons described in the Ada San his aim and the works of ALLAN Humri In England it has become the season for outings, and for that purpose it the pleasantest part of the year, when the lark sings m skies of blue and me through among green woodlands The case, however, is very different in Australia We can easily under stand, apart from religious grounds', how the May festival of the church has become the spring holiday of the people. When Suabmn people game to the Lichtenstein Castle's place a famous in the history and legend 01 Southern Germany as Wolf's Crag in the tales of Scotland-and-cover the¬´ hats with leaves, and drink deep draughts of lager beer, and dance through the lengthening shadows of an afternoon, we recognise that the season is fitted for a popular demonstration There every place of business is closes, every work stopped, every handles interrupted. As in Goethe's great de scription, the peer and the peasant, the soldier and the civilian, the student and the shopkeeper, make common BOH day But in Australia we are place, in a totally different position the latter end of May, or two earlier part of June, w left and no one cares to leave his works the sake of facing rainy skies and a touring winds As a consequence, new business pursue the even concurrent way, and only the tanks so that the great inconvenience of the men the community. But why on as should the banks here bout thwarted for a holiday that is not ours because in England and Europe was institutions are closed in honour holiday that is universally cello who i Were there any religious son men the matter, we should be the to complain When, however, that neither religion nor pleasure, next holtness nor holiday making, the P J observance of Whit Monday, in falls at an inclement season 01 year, seems to be abaurI J means let us have recognised horse" for bank clerks and for all other classes, whether, like Christmas, they comme morale events in the history of Christianity, or whether they simply mark the artificial and ill arranged divisions between one year and another But, then, a holiday should be generally recognised, so that the community will not suffer as if from a temporary strike The medical profession would probably suggest that a real spring holiday in September or October would be better both for the overworked bank clerk and the public The late railway accident at North Melbourne should lend weight to the demand for additional rolling stock, which found expression at the recent meeting of the corn trade committee of the Chamber of Commerce, The latter body are, of course, qua committee, not concerned with the question, so far as it affects the safety of the travelling public But the interests which they directly represent receive so much injury from the state of things that at present exists, that they are able even without such support, to make out a very strong case Last year a great deal of inconvenience and actual lOsS was suffered by corn growers, owing to the inability of the Railway department to transport all the produce Orders could not be supplied, and markets were lost, because the grain that was wanted in Melbourne was blocking up the country stations, awaiting the time when it could be removed All this is likely to be repeated in the coming season, with the further aggravation that the extension of the railway system which has gone on amco will probably make the deficiency of rolling stock still greater and more severely felt In these circumstances, those who represent the grain industry are anxious that efficient steps should be taken to supply the lacking trucks, and to prevent the loss that must ensue if these steps are not taken The demand certainly seems reasonable enough, and one which it is scarcely fair to refuse It is difficult to say at the present rate of progress when the requirements of the country in the means of transport will be Bates tied Every year these requirements will be greater, and the demand is at present so far ahead of the supply that it must be a long time before the latter is able to overtake the former This map ought to be filled up forthwith, and matters put once more on an even footing It is possible that, in order to bring this about, plant will have to be imported, as the colonial makers seem quite unable to supply it in the required quantity It is no doubt desirable that as far as possible the trade should he kept in the colony, and to that end orders should first be placed with every colonial manufacturer But in exceptional circumstances exceptional remedies have to be sought And if, as seems certain, there will be still a balance which cannot be supplied here, it ought to be obtained from outside After the gap has once been filled up such a course would in all probability not be necessary again Meanwhile, however, there is a danger that anovouB injury will be inflicted upon an important industry from fear of in- fringing a doctrine, which is reasonable enough, but which has in the present case been pushed to an altogether unreasonable extreme. There will be no sitting of the Legislative Council to day, but the Legislative Assembly will meet at half-past 4 o'clock Ministers will be asked to reply to several questions, a number of which have been given notice of by new members Mr Stuart will bring up the old question of the removal of the Melbourne Gaol, and ask the Chief Secretary if the Government propose to recommend that it be removed Mr 1 nylon will urge the Premier to place a sum on the Estimates for the purpose of carrying out the Hawthorn main drainage works, and Mr Wilkinson will ask the same Minister when the Fitzroy to Whittlesea railway will be opened Of the old members, Mr Graves will question the Minister of Lands in reference to an amendment of the Rabbit Act, Mr Williams will ask the Minister of Water Supply when the new reservoir is to be constructed , Mr Highett will question the Minister of Mines in regard to the sludge difficulty at Huntly Mr Madden will request the Minister of I linda to make the rabbit question one of urgency ; Colonel Smith will ask the Minister of Railways when the direct line to Ballarat will be opened After preliminary business has been disposed of, Mr Gillies will move the adoption of the new standing orders and the debate will follow It is not expected that there will be much discussion on the rules as a whole because the greater part of them commend themselves to the approval of every, member of the House But the rules relating to the suspension of the standing orders, to motions for the adjourn- ment of the House, and to the introduction of the closure will be well debated Our Creswick correspondent telegraphs that Mr J) M Davies, the Commissioner of Public Works is to be opposed on seeking reelection for Grenville by Mr David M Grath the president of the Creswick Shire t Council Mr M Grath lett Allandale for the Grenville electorate on Monday afternoon, to enter upon the contest immediately Our Ballarat correspondent telegraphs that Mr Reuben Keirl has definitely decided to oppose Mr O M Davies, and will announce his candidature in to days papers the statements of the Postmaster General in reference to the probable action of the Government concerning the mail contract in the event of the home authorities declining to further consider the question of the altera- lion or the day of departure from the colonies, appear to have been received with general satisfaction in commercial circles It is anticipated that the joint protest from the colonies against the action taken, and urging that the question should again be opened up, will be forwarded to London some time during this week It is not considered that the question will occupy more than a few days in settlement in the event of the negotiations being prolonged, or of a decision unfavourable to the colonies being arrived at, the question of further action will be taken into consideration the Orient Company, as intimated by the Postmaster General to the Chamber of Commerce deputation last week, will be asked to fix its days of departure from Adelaide on alternate Satur daiB Instead of on alternate Mondays as at present says the company is understood to be willing to do The negotiations on the subject however, will not be conducted with the Orient Company direct, but through the British Postmaster General, who made the mail contract. 'The company, of course, would have to be bound by any decision of the authority referred to that the mails shall leave as at present, but it is not considered that there could be any objection to the alteration of the day of departure in view of the fact that the Orient boats do not carry Indian and China mails in regard to the arrangements of which the whole of the present difficulty has arisen here II and O. Company Is inn somewhat different position from the Orient Company, inasmuch as its steamers carry the mails referred to the contract which has been made therefore, is binding upon the comPany in regard to those mails as well as to the mails from this colony, Correspondence is still passing between the Premier of Tasmania (Mr P O Fysh) and Mr Gillies, upon the subject of the removal of restrictions under the stock regulations of a store upon the importation into this colony of Tasmanian stud sheep Mr Fysh, in his last communication, states that he cannot conceive that the most zealous guardian of the pastoral interests of Victoria would Bon ously advocate the retention of the regulation requiring the dipping before landing of all Tasmanian sheep, on the ground that the sheep of that colony, and more pur ticularly us stud sheep (with regard to which, he says, the owners must pay the most particular attention could communicate as to the stocks of Victoria Absolute prohibition In 1 at mania against the importa- a don of sheep from loch colonies M were still infected, and the precautions observed during transit by sea, were sufficient safeguards against the introduction of the disease via Tasmania. In conclusion, Mr Fysh asks that he may be furnished with a detailed statement of the objections of the stock authorities of Victoria to the landing of Tasmanian sheep without dipping in order that his Government may omit no precaution to satisfy local requirements, this communication has been referred to Mr. I! M Curr (chief inspector of stock), who has replied that the very fact that Tasmania admits that it takes precaution to prevent the contagion being conveyed by sea borne sheep to the Australian colonies shows that a fair, exists In view of that fact he cannot recommend that the owners of SO millions of sheep in Australia should be subjected to a risk to benefit the owners of a few hundreds of stud sheep in Tasmania. It was inde- sirable also that the safety of the Australian flocks should depend upon Tasmanian officers, who were not responsible to the Government of Victoria. The second objection was the possibility of the removal, without detection, of sheep from a vessel trading out side Australia into one plying between the colonies Mr Curr s views receive the hearty approval of the Government The success which attended the expert mental trawling for fish, on the recent cruise of the Lady Loch, has induced the Commissioner of Customs to recommend to the Cabinet that bonuses be given to the first person to bring to Melbourne specified cargoes of fish obtained by trawling His colleagues have concurred in the proposal, and the conditions and amounts of the houses will be published as soon as possible With reference to the question of dredging near the Williamstown piers, the Commissioner of Customs is not altogether satisfied with the recent reply received on the subject from the Harbour Trust It was contended by the trust at the time that the bay dredging was by no means being neglected for the sake of river operations, and it was pointed out that it was the intention at an early date pending the arrival of two dredges recently ordered from England, and expected to arrive in the colony in December-to purchase one or more dredges In Adelaide or New Zealand. The latter, It was intimated, would be specially used for bay pier dredging, and should it occur that they could not be obtained at an early period one of the large river dredges would be utilised Mr Patterson is of opinion that the work of dredging the piers in the bay is of such importance that one of the river dredges ought to be taken from its present work at once, especially as it is admitted that, by its removal, the operations for deepening the river to a uniform depth of 20ft will not be materially interfered with. A communication to this effect was yesterday forwarded to the trust by the department in connection with the dredging question, and with special reference to the recent grounding at Williamstown of the Ormuz, it has been suggested that in all tidal ports of the world it is the custom of pilots to enter and take out large steamers on a full tide '1 his custom, however, does not prevail in the port of Melbourne, in as much as between high and low water there is seldom a difference of more than a couple of feet, so that vessels ought to be able to go in and out at all times Mr W (Galbraith (chief clerk and assistant secretary of the Post-office department) was yesterday appointed by the Executive Council to the position of secretary for Public Works, rendered vacant by the death of the late Mr C Le Cren. Mr Galbraith will commence his duties forthwith During the course of the debate in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday last on Colonel Smith's motion in favour of the modification of the departmental regulations containing provisions as to the height and age of persons who are to be admitted to the public service, the statement was made that men had been debarred from entering the service because they were below a certain standard height The Public Sett ice Hoard point out that this is a mistake. No regula- tion is in operation which forbids persons of less than a certain height entering the service. The only branch which has rules on the subject is the Railway department by which a certain physical qualification " insisted on The practice of the board when dealing with applicants for such positions as that of a warder of the Pentridge penal establishment is to send the applicant to the inspector general (Mr Brett), who determines at a personal interview whether the applicant is qualified to net, and the board subsequently determines whether it will accept Mr Brett. certificate There is, however, no limitation in the matter of height. The board recognises that the provision of the Public Service Statute which requires candidates to be under 26 years of age should be amended, so as to allow of persons of a greater age entering the employment of the Government. The demand made by several members during the course of the debate, that the whole of the candidates presenting themselves for examination ought to be examined cannot be complied with in the present state of the law. The statute directs that the board shall make regulations for limiting by ballot the number of candidates to be examined to not less than three times the number of persons to be appointed The board, in compliance with that provision, has fixed the limit of candidates at not less than four times the number of vacancies, and will not make any alteration of the regulation unless directed to do so by the Legislature. The Postmaster General was yesterday interviewed by Mr Langridge, MLA, and Mr Beazley, M L A., on the subject of the completion of the front of the Collingwood Post office, the work in connection with which, it was urged, should be carried out at as early a date as possible Mr Denham intimated that he would obtain an estimate of the cost, and would consider the advisability of proceeding with the completion of the structure when preparing the departmental estimates Mr G S Perrin, conservator of forests, has compiled a return showing the heights of giant trees of Australia Prior to 1888 the largest trees reported were one discovered at Mount Baw Bow by Mr G W. Robinson, Its height being stated at 430ft, and one 180ft. high reported to have been discovered by Mr Fergusson but the locality was not sped tied Since 1888 trees ranging from 20ft. to 22ft were measured at the head of the Yea River by Mr It W Puller, engineer. In May last, also, Mr Perrin measured trees in the Sassafras Gully, Dandenong, which varied in height from 23ft to 23ft 4in Intelligence has been received in Melbourne of the arrival in London in excellent condition of the consignment of apples recently sent as a test shipment by Mr O Neilson, curator of the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardens, Richmond The fruit was despatched by the Orient steamer Cuzco, and concurrently with ltB export Mr. Neilson forwarded to the secretary for Agriculture (Mr D Martin) a case of the fruit, which he asked him to place in Home cool part of the office until the arrival of the Cuzco in London was announced in the public press This has been done, and yesterday Mr Martin opened the case The apples were found to be packed in tissue paper, the interstices between them being filled in with paper shavings 'The fruit was in excellent condition and without a blemish Hope is expressed by the officers of the department that in view of the success of Mr Neilson's ex parliament a. considerable impulse will be given to the fruit trade between Victoria and the mother country It has been arranged that the Government steamer the Lady Loch shall shortly proceed to the South Western Coast for the purpose of conducting trawling operations At the meeting of the City Council yesterday the principal subject of discussion was the letting of the shops and stalls in the Western Market tenders had been invited from the present occupiers for a lease at five years, but the offers were not considered satisfactory. A private offer for the whole block of buildings considerably exceeded the aggregate of the offers by the tenants The market committee did not desire to accept this without inviting tenders publicly for the whole market, and they recommended that they should be authorised to call for tenders for I five years for one year, of the whole of the tenements. A deputation of the occupiers recently waited upon the Mayor and protested against the whole of the buildings being let to one person. After considerable discussion the recommendation of the committee was adopted the recommendation of the public works committee that a Shand and Mason are engine at ¬£888, to be taken charge of and maintained by the Fire Insurance Company's Brigade, was referred back to the committee, as an offer had been received of a Merryweather and Son engine at 6550 The health committee was empowered to endeavour to make arrangements with the Minister of Lands for the restoration of the northern part of the Carlton gardens destroyed by the Exhibition cconmieaioners The University Council, at its meeting yesterday, decided to ask the Government for funds to provide for the establishment of three additional lecturers in connection with the engineering school, namely, one on mechanical engineering, one on architecture, and one on hydraulic engineering, at a salary of ¬£250 each per annum. It had already been decided to ask for the sum of ¬£1,000 to estab- lish a chair of pathology in the medical school, and for ¬£1 BOO to create a new office of principal of the University, besides ¬£20,000 as a special building grant On the motion of Dr Morrison, it was decided that the practice of publishing examination results in batches of 60 should he discontinued, but that each examiner should still be required to send to the registrar each successive oO directly he completes it Ashore acreages limited competition among leading architects was called for by the Trinity College authorities for the new hostel which is intended to afford residential accommodation to ladies who are studying at the University The first portion of the building will be erected by Lady Clarke, who has generously given a donation of ¬£5,000 for this object 'the ladies' council having unanimously chosen the plan submitted by Mr D'Ebro a portion of the building will shortly be commenced The whole scheme embraces a large block of buildings to cost ¬£25,000 having dining-hall, reception rooms, gym radium, residential block tor matron and quarters and studies for SO students with all necessary sanitary arrangements. Principal Rainy delivered a lecture yesterday afternoon to the students at Ormond College on " Undergraduate Studies from the Christian Point of View ' Mr J H Mac Farland, the master of the college, occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance of students and visitors to hear the lecture Principal Rainy dwelt upon the advantages of an academic course of culture and in referring to the different subjects which it included said that though the students might not always see the connection between scientific and Christian truths they would find in the end that their belief in Christianity would be strengthened A vote of thanks was tendered to Principal Rainy, on the motion of Mr W Howieson, seconded by Mr 'I Cherry A dispute recently arose between the Victorian Society of Coopers and the firm of M'Cracken and Co, brewers, which threatened at one time to lead to serious difficulties By the advice of Mr T Humphries, secretary of the Employers' Union, who had received a formal letter from Mr Bennett, secretary of the Trades hall Council, a conference was arranged at which a representative of the Society of Coopers and a representative of the firm of M Cracker and Co were present, with the result that the points in dispute were amicably settled Mr Humphries yesterday received a letter from Mr Lynch, secretary of the Victorian Society of Coopers, thanking him for the careful and impartial manner in which he had acted in the matter. A quantity of meat preserved at Stawell on May 6 by what is known as the Barmen process was opened for inspection at the Australasian Mortgage and Agency Company B store yesterday The sample consisted of the cases of two sheep, treated by the dry process, and a cask of beef in Barmenit pickle The result was unfavourable, the mutton being far gone in decomposition The beef was sound, though it had a slight peculiar odour A leg of mutton that had been placed in the cask of beef was decomposed at the bone and had tainted the surrounding beef the result of this experiment was a great disappointment, as the reports of private trials during the hot weather in the Stawell district had led people to expect a very different result A suit for dissolution of marriage was tried in the Supreme Court yesterday before Mr Justice Hodges, in which one John Wm Jackson, a carpenter, was the petitioner, and his wife, Agnes Jackson, was the respondent.

The case for the plaintiff was that he was in the employment of the defendant on the 23rd October last, and that his thumb was then crushed by a machine and was so much hurt that he could not work for six months after wards, he was in the employment of the defendant for some time before the accident, and the defendant had, for about 20 months before then, deducted 3d per fortnight from the plaintiff a wages under an agreement to pay him two thirds of his wages each week in case he might become incapacitated for work through injury caused to him by any accident whilst he was employed by the defendant, provided the accident arose from any fault of the defendant or his machinery, 'The defence was that the 3d per fortnight was deducted on the understanding that the defendant should insure his men with the Employers' Union and Indemnity Company, so that they might receive two thirds of each weeks wages when out of employment through accidents occurring while at work that the defendant insured his mon with the company, that the plaintiff had sued the company named for damages, and had taken ¬£21 as satisfaction for all demands against them, and that he, therefore, had not any claim against the defendant His Honour Judge Casey, who heard the case, returned a verdict for the defendant with coats 'the sittings of the Melbourne Sessions Court were continued yesterday before his Honour Judge Worthington, Mr R Walsh prosecuting for the Crown Michael Hogan, a young man, was tried on a charge of stealing a watch and chain The evidence for the prosecution was that a man named Andrews who is a labourer, went into the Salvation Army barracks in Little Bourke-street on Saturday, 20th April, and be stayed there about 20 minutes When he left the barracks he found that he had been robbed of his watch and chain 'The watch was afterwards pawned at the shop of Mr J Mandelberg, in I Kilroy, and Mr Mandelberg identified the prisoner as the man who pawned it The defence was that the pawnbroker was miss taken in identifying the prisoner, and that he was not the man who pawned the watch The jury acquitted the prisoner, and he was discharged Thomas 'Terrill, a youth, was convicted of embezzling ¬£1 4s, the property of his employer George M'Gowan, of Hawthorn wood dealer 'The money had been given to the prisoner by a customer for Mr M Gowan, and the prisoner did not pay it over to him The prisoner was remanded for sentence George Wilson, who had been committed for trial on a charge of stealing from the person, and who had been admitted to bail, did not appear when called upon, and his recognisances were estreated and the bail forfeited Samuel I it patrick and Edward Woodruffe were arraigned on the charges of breaking into the house of John West, in Aided place, off Collins street, on the 18th ult, and stealing a watch and some jewellery of the value of about ¬£80 Mr, Arness defended the prisoners The case had only been partly heard when the Court adjourned until this morning We are requested to state that the gentlemen who have been summoned to attend as jurors this morning at the sittings of the Melbourne General Sessions Court will not be required, and therefore need not attend at the court The jurors already empanelled in the case of Fitzpatrick and Woodruffe, charged with housebreaking, which has been partly heard, will, of course, attend the court this morning to conclude the hearing of that case Since Baron Nordenskjold, eight years ago, circumnavigated the European and Asian Continent, solving by the way the ancient problem of the North East Passage, and a year or two later attempted to cross Green land, there have been frequent rumours as to his next great enterprise. An antarctic expedition and an attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land are two of the undertakings he has been credited with organising The truth is (says The Times) that Baron Nordenskjold has for several years been actively engaged in a very different kind of work. He has, indeed, been explor- ing, and that to some purpose ; but his ex pi orations have been in the museums and libraries of Europe, and the object of his search has been old maps. Instead of attempting to add further to our present knowledge of geography, be has been seeking to discover now much the ancients knew of the earth's surface and what care- graphical methods they adopted to exhibit that knowledge. Readers of the fascinating narrative of the Voyage of the Vega will remember that several old maps of Northern Europe and Asia are given in that work, and probably it was these maps which gave Baron Nordenskjold the desire to learn more about the cartography of the ancients At any rate, be has been absorbed in his search for several years, with abundant and instructive results which will shortly be given to the world in a magnificent volume, of atlas size, published simultaneously in Swedish and in English, and containing some 50 fac simile reproduction (many of them double folio) of the treasure he has found, on the scale, in many cases of the original maps These will be accompanied by text describ ing methods of map making from the time of Ptolemy downwards, and analysing in detail the contents of the various maps contained in the volume Baron Nordenskjold, during his many years eager search, has succeeded in forming a large and in some respects unrivalled private collection of old maps of the 15th and 16th centuries so far as editions of Ptolemy are concerned his collection Is probably unapproached. The results, as they will appear in his forthcoming work, will be somewhat novel " An ancient law, passed in the good old colony times, which has just been unearthed in New Jersey, must in its day, ' remarks the London Standard, " have brought fear and trembling to many female hearts. It enacts that if any woman impose upon, seduce, or betray into matrimony ' one of His Majesty subjects, she shall incur the penalty now in force against witchcraft and the like misdemeanours ' ' Scents, cosmetics washes, paints, artificial teeth, and high heeled shoes,' are specially forbidden by this Bull in repealed act, which probably dates from a time soon after Lord John Berkeley bad softly his share of the territory to a firm of Quakers, and Sir George Carteret had followed his example by disposing of the other moiety of the plantation to a society of the same religious persuasion At that period, or soon after, New Jersey was one of the most bigoted of all the American colonies The great majority of the people were Quakers, Presbyterians, and Anabaptists The Blue Laws of Connecticut,' some of which are still in force, have for ages been proverbial A man might not work, whistle, or kiss his wife on the Sunday, and profane swearing is to this day finale It is only right to say, however that many of the oft quoted clauses in the 'BlueLaws'are now believed to have been a forgery, the work of the Rev Samuel Peters But in Mass sachets the laws against witchcraft were carried out relentlessly by the clergy and the earth, and in New Jersey the dominant party were equally merciless The customary penalties for witchcraft were burning at the stake and drowning, so that the ladies of the Carteret Berkeley colony exercised their dangerous wiles at their peril What makes this ancient law most interesting to the student of bygone customs is the evidence it affords of marriage being unconsciously regarded, even as late as the reign of Charles II in the light of a mere commercial contract, and therefore coming under the head of any other bargain in which trickery was not to be tolerated At a still earlier date the woman was considered, as Petruchio looked upon Katherine, simply as a chattel, and if the law did not directly recognise the popular belief, it certainly winked at it. There was, for example the famous case of Sir John de Camoys, who formally leased his wife to Sir William de Payne- The lady not being a consenting party, the Courts on her appeal in against the validity of the transaction, declared it on that account null and void, which proves that in the Middle Ages the judges still held that such a villainous bargain was a matter for serious argument An extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Union Trustee Company of Australia Limited was held at the company s office, St James s buildings, at affairs street yesterday at noon. The meeting was held in accordance with a suggestion which was made at a meeting on the 27th of May A statement was then submitted showing that a sum of i 1,267 Sa 6d was available for division amongst the shareholders who formed the late Union Trustees, Executors, and Administrators Company Limited, and it was agreed to dispose of the amount by declaring a dividend of 2s has yet share, to award ¬£200 to the directors for their past services, and to give gratuities equivalent to six months' salary to the manager and accountant At yesterday s meeting Mr J Blyth presided and formal resolutions were passed to give effect to the proposal The first of the final season of the " Santley Concerts " will be given to night in the lawn hull.
