CLIPPINGS. For many weeks past (remarks the St. Petersburg correspondent of the London Times writing on December 4) the Russian press has never ceased to bewail the unexpeoted rise to predominance of England's influence at the expense of Russia in Teheran, This feeling has now produced a vigorous press attack on England, Persia, and the Russian Foreign Office, At first the Russian ambassador, Prinoe Dolgorouky, was censured for being absent from his post, thus giving Sir Henry Drummond Wolff an opening, Neither M, de (Hers nor Mi Zinovieff, who did bo much to es tablish Russian prestige in Persia, in conjunct tion with General Skobeloff, ia spared in the sweeping denunciation levelled against the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of its unsuccessful conduct of affairs with Persia. For three days in succession the NQVOQ Vremya has contained three columns on this theme, To-day it reprints a long letter from General Skobeloff to a Russian diplomatist, written in 1870, which was translated into the Times and other London newspapers in March, 1884, This political ghost of General Skobeloff is again brought before the directors of Russian diplo macy to warn them, in the words of the late hero, against the attempts sure to be made by England, " bearing at first a purely commercial character," but in reality constituting "indireot invasive aotion aimed against Russia's posses, sions in the Oauoasus and Central Asia, and against preponderating influence throughout Persia," The campaign opened in the Novoe Vremya against the diplomatists is evidently the work of its staff of military politicians and writers, In their opinion Sir H, Drummond Wolff has not only secured the navigation of the Karun, but has also instigated Persia's refusal to permit the residence of a Russian Consul at Meshed, emboldened the Shah's Government to prohibit the sale of wheat to the Russians at Lutfabad, and encouraged the Persians to shirk the construction of their half of the high road from ABkabad to Meshed. Both North and South Persia have suddenly fallen completely under the power of the British Ambassador, whose appointment was not so long ago hailed by Muscovite editors almost with derision -- ao absolutely confident were they of a monopoly of influence at Teheran, Sir H. Drummond Wolff's success is considered a national Russian disaster, equal to the failure of the first Akkal Tekkee expedi tion, Suoh ft collapse of ilussian asoendanoy is described as a " derailment of the diplomatic train," for which the Foreign Office and the whole system of Russian diplomacy are to blame, To obviate the evil effects of the catas trophe, concludes the Novae Vremya, Russia must uot only oounterbribe all the Persian Ministers, but take Btrong aotion direotly against the Shah for bis violation of a treaty in respeot of the reported prohibition of the sale of cereals over the JShorasan frontier. The proposed tunnel between Denmark and Sweden (saye an English contemporary) is not likely to be again heard of, for it has found a auoceaaor in the public favor, A project for throwing a bridge across thu Sound from Elsinore in Denmark to Helain berg in Sweden iB now in fashion j the dis tance across being 18,000ft., and the depth of water 70ft, The job will be rather a big one j and a glance at the map will serve to show that a steam ferry would better suit the locality, It is misleading to say that the bridge will connect Denmark and Sweden, for in reality it will connect Sweden with Island of Zeeiand-a muoh more formidable, un» bridgable gap, in the shape of the Great Belt, separating Zealand from continental Denmark. The traffic in such a locality cau never pay for either a bridge or a tunnel, There are 4,582 miles of Swedish railways, but they were conlstruoted with seven differ, ent gauges. There are 970 miles of rail in Norway j but not a single additional mile has been constructed since 1883, The length of the Danish railways is 1,249 mileB, There is not muoh room for further development in the three kingdoms, the united population of whioh is 8,034,000 j so that there is a mile of rail for every 1,209 inhabitants, a muoh larger allowance than iB found to be sufficient for Great Britain and Ireland. Latest American despatches state that James Wilson, of County Down, Ireland, has arrived there andis on exhibition, His normal chest measure ia 88in,, but he can expand his lungs BO that his ohest measures 58in,, and he oan snap a strong leather strap by the lung pressure, Such feats as holding a full grown man on his outstretched legs are easy to him, The American papers publish hiB portrait and biography. The dootors Bay that the expansive power of bis chest is marvellous j but prediots that he will fall dead from apoplexy if he persists in breaking BtrapB by hard breathing, Dr, Cooper, of Pittsburg (says the Pall Mall Gazette) has invented a process which he expects will supersede embalming and oremation, being muoh leas expensive than either. He subjects a dead body to hydraulic pressure and condenses it into a small solid blooki like veined marble, The body of a full- grown man oan, he olaims, he reduoed to a oubo of 12 inches. Dr. Cooper exhibits a small cross, apparently of marble. «»That," says he, «'is the body 0f a child, converted into a handsome ornament." The material ia tasteless, odorless, and seemingly imporish able, Cremntion costs £10: compression will cost only a fifth of that sum. The Shakers were founded by Ann Lee on her arrival from England about 100 years ago. Thoy believo that the present time is the milennium of 1000 years, and that a tenth part of it has passed already, During this time they will not marry nor give in marriage, but live together as brothers and Bisters-living lives of celibacy. Every member is bound to do some kind of work and to be due no man a farthing,
