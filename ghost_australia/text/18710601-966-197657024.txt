THE CASE OF DOUGLAS. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—You will of course allow me to reply. I don't know how " Shakspeare'e Ghost" gets his living; but if honestly, what more right haB he to be a newspaper correspondent or meddle with public affairs than I have? I reject his recommendation, and advise him not again to degrade Shakspeare's immortal lines on the quality of mercy. They •were addressed by Portia on behalf of an unfortunate _ but upright insolvent, and not in interceding for the perpetrator of a cowardly revolting murder. The Rev. Mr. Parsons has ~made out no case in favour of Douglas, who it seems did sit under his ministry, but did not profit by it, for he shortly afterwards committed murder. Mr. Parsons's description of me as being a pragmatical and egotistical individual will appear to any one reading his speech on the trumpery precedency questional uncommonly like a case of the devil rebuking sin. Already an aspirant after Douglas's fame has appeared in the Police Court for threatening to serve his wile as Douglas served his, and Mr. Parsons had better keep his powder dry for the coming occurrence. I am, Sir, &c.;, SAMUEL TOMKINSOK.
