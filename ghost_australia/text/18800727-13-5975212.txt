The speech which his Excellency will deliver at the opening of Parliament to day will have a value of its own It would be folly for Ministers to submit a formal programme for the session when power has passed away from them, but short as the speech must necessarily be, it may yet contain a statement of the work to which Parliament, no matter who may occupy the Treasury benches, will be compelled to address itself That work may be described in the two words " reform " and " finance " Reform is played out as a mere party question No populat leader can conjure with the name again, but it remains to be dealt with as a matter of practical legislation And finance, like Banquets ghost at the banquet, of trades itself, and will not be denied In the first place, we may assume that attention will be called to the state of the national finances, for without doubt this is the pressing question of the day. The position is much too serious to be trifled with or to permit of delay Events have shown that the expenditure of last year was based upon estimates of revenue altogether extravagant They were nothing like realised, and even if we indulge in the belief that the falling off was phenomenal in its extent, a complete recovery is not to be hoped for This fact is apparent when we take the more prominent items into consideration - 1870 80 La be mated Revenue Reef at Realised De Spirits, wine, to bacco, &c; Ad valorem and new duties Land Sales by auction Selectors payments Railway income £ 071,400 713,194 200,000 771 350 1,470 000 £ 035,704 404,002 111,327 581,542 1,420 000 £ 35,096 219,132 88,173 1897-98 45,000 Here is a deficiency of nearly £600,000 per annum, and the bulk of the falling off would seem to be permanent in character The business outlook is not so cheerful that we can anticipate any large immediate improvement at the Customs, to say nothing of the probability that the protective duties will yearly dwindle away The delusion that such duties can be called upon to bring in revenue as well as to subsidise industries must now be regarded as tolerably exposed by the inexorable logic of facts Taking last year's estimates as the standard, a falling off at the Customs of at least £200,000 has to be laced And so at the Lands department No one would advise the sale of country lands by auction in a market glutted by the operation of the free selection system, and to realise £200,000 per annum by the sale of town sites seems at the present juncture an impossibility Nor can we expect the selectors' payments to amount to the old sum of £800,000 per annum again The Land Act of 1879 has made an important difference in the financial position by substituting annual payments of 5s per acre for annual payments of 2s per acre 'The selectors who came in under the original act are now beginning to obtain their Crown grants, and then places will be taken by selectors who will only pay half the former price, and the revenue cannot but feel the change Again, the selectors have learned now that no Minister dare incur the odium of evicting an agricultural tenant for the non payment of rent Even the formal notice which used to be served upon the selectors who fell into arrears has been withdrawn, and under these circumstances it would hardly be wise to expect a return to the old system of punctual payments Above all, we have to face the circumstance that only a few million acres of agricultural land now remain to be disposed of and that consequently very soon selection must receive a check from which it is not possible that it should recover And as land is taken up, it follows that the receipts from pastoral leases, which have diminished in the past, must y> on still diminishing in the future in all probability our land revenue reached its highest point in the last few year, when it brought in the magnificent sum of £1,200,000 per annum, and now we shall have to submit to a gradual falling away Dealing with the situation as a whole, Ministers will have to announce that the country is in debt, and that the revenue is materially deficient, and they are justified in taking this last official opportunity of calling the attention of the House and of the country to the fact that a financial crisis exists, because, no doubt, the immediate danger is that the situation will not be fairly faced by their successors, and that we shall have more of the rash estimates and the blundering extravagance which have plunged us into the difficulty As two Parliaments in succession have been dissolved upon the reform queg tion, Ministers cannot possibly avoid a reference to the subject in the speech, and we may expect that they will express the hope that an Assembly fresh from the country will be able to deal with the much vexed issue In one sense the hope will possibly be realised The radical majority, we presume, will see the propriety of abandoning the mad crusade which they initiated two years ago, and will agree to accept some such measure for the improvement of the Council as any Ministry could have obtained any time for years past The great division between the constitutional and the radical parties as regards reform has been that the one has sought to strengthen the Council and the other has endeavoured to subordinate it, and the one measure that is now possible is a bill to popularise and improve the Upper House Plans for obviating deadlocks by mechanical means and for obtaining finality in legislation objects professedly dear to the radical mind must be abandoned, and a measure to we idea the electoral basis of the Upper House, to subdivide the provinces, and to shorten the tenure of office, must be parsed, or else reform must be altogether set aside, with an acknowledgment that the strife and bitterness of the past two years were altogether unnecessary, and that the country was convulsed for nothing A reform on the lines of the original measure of the Council, some measure similar to Part No 2 of the Service Bill, is, however, not only poa sil le, but is popularly demanded, and if the radicals can accept it the consti- tulionalists certainly can The dead lock danger would continue to exist, but the leaders of the Radical party would have the fear of a strong Council before their eyes, and would probably be more cautious than of yore, and of the old Adam should prove to be strong within them, if they persist in tacking, and in otherwise domineering over the Upper House, they would be more than ever likely to find out their mistake in common decency no Government can altogether shirk reform, and we are justified in assuming with confidence that any step which receives the assent of the two Houses must be favourable to the constitutional cause For the rest, the Governor will probably remind the Houses that there are non party measures which are await- ing the approval of Parliament A railway construction bill is required, because the fund borrowed to make railways with is still unapplied The interests of the selectors demand that the schemes of water conservation which have been prepared should be carried out And as the Land Act of 1869 expires this year, the question of pastoral occupation must be dealt with Short as the speech must be, it will thus refer to matters the satisfactory adjustment of which would earn for Parliament the gratitude of the country The energies of a wise Assembly would be taxed, and the hearty co-operation of the Council would be required to achieve successful results The commencement has been most inauspicious, but the poet writes On ' yet we trust that somehow good it will be the final goal of ill And patriotism will hope against hope that in performance the eleventh Parliament of Victoria may infinitely surp iss the promise of its birth Every day brings with it some fresh instance of that peculiar sort of moderation which we have been led to believe will henceforward characterise the proceedings of the "Berryite party We should have thought that up to Saturday last it had done quite sufficient to approve its newly adopted forbearance and self control in the sight of all men It had openly violated Patha mentary precedent, it had attempted to expel a Government by brute force, and bad wantonly insulted the representative of the Crown Seeing that it had accomplished all this in the short space of two days, it was surely in a position to pause for eight and forty hours before giving any more proofs of its temperance there was all the more reason why it should "rest and be thankful until today, because its revolution any proceedings had accomplished the main purpose they were intended to serve By the want of confidence motion carried on Friday His Ex no men had been formally notified that Gujlin or BURin not SnoRr or O Siivn way, was the Oppositions friend, and this having been made plain, the matter might have dropped but the leaders and advisers of the " Berry ite faction evidently could not view the matter in this limit Having gone so far has zing tasted and seen that the new sort of model which was just as pleasant as the old there ardently longed to give some further evidence of their conciliatory intentions Accordingly the chief " Berryite organ was moved to express an opinion to the effect that the outrage of 1 rid my should be followed up by some further indications of a meek and quiet spirit-some additional exemplifications of that law abiding, peaceful, and generous du position which in future is to animate the "Berryites in all then wanton or selfish aggressions upon law and decency 1a The duty of making further inroads I upon constitutional practice for no particular reason that we can see, except to arouse public time in worse than useless proceedings-was suggested by the organ aforesaid in a light and airy tray which cannot fail to reassure those poor souls who imagine that "Berryiam" must at all times and under all circumstances mean turmoil and agitation " It seems to us," said the journal alluded to in its issue of yesterday, that the Opposition are bound '. to take some course which shall of not be a retreat from the position >. they assumed on Friday, when they " brought forward and carried a vote of W want of confidence in the (Govern " ment' That is to say, that having flour one lawless and improper act, Mr Beeby: and his friends should not hesitate, in order to in like it as objectionable as possible, to supplement it by another The paragraph then goes on to admit that the members of the Opposition cannot prevent the Govt took from of coming down to the Council and read a. ing any speech which Mr. SERvice may put into his hands Not even, we suppose, if the wh >le force, Leaded by the valiant Mirams, armed Cfith that formidable umbrella which Wundi has made so familiar to the read ing public were to dispute his entrance But while it is admitted that the patriots cannot very well " bar out" His Excellency if he thinks fit to visit the Parliament buildings, it is asserted that the gentle creatures " would be perfectly justified if they interdicted the report 11 of the speech in the usual way to " the Assembly " Such a course, although unwary], might perhaps be pursued without a direct violation of Parliamentary law May says that as in the Commons the bill, '(to, any bill) " is only required to be read before the report of the Queen's Speech, fl and other business is constantly entered I upon before the reading of the bill, as " the issue of new writs the considera- *f tion of matters of privilege, the pro 'r sentation of papers and the usual f sessional orders and resolutions " Now "privilege" is a very elastic covering, and it is impossible to say what might or might not be done under its shadow But without waiting to consider whether the pro needing suggested would be in a cordance with precedent or not, we may safely take exception to the asser- tion that it could be justified," perfectly or imperfectly What justification could be urged for wasting valuable time in endeavouring to vindicate a line of action which those who adopted it know to have been unconstitutional and unwarranted ? In the present state of the finances the country really could not afford this sort of moderation In case " the party " should decide that having done badly it ought to do worse, a plan was drawn up for its guidance which certainly possesses the merit of being laughable It was suggested that in order to bring the Governor and his advisers to their knees Mr Bl duty should move name diately on the assembling of the 11 House, and before the Govern oil's " speech is reported, that this House 81 ' having passed a vote of want of con " ' fidence in the Government, decline "'to entertain any other business'" Supposing this were carried, what then] If the Go EiiNon stood firm and refused to take my notice of a resolution passed at an illegal sitting, and the Ministry, as in duty 1 c and, stood by him, we should have a very pretty little deadlock to commence with ills Lx fleecy, Living once taken up such a position in defence of the prerogative of the down could not give way, and the business of the country would probably be at a standstill until the death or deposition of Mr Berry, at the hands of ex- asperated supporters, kept waiting wearily for their "sugar," furnished a solution of the difficulty We need hardly say that there never was danger of " the party " being led into such a trap as that just referred to IS of doubt it would like very much to show its moderation by humiliating its opponents in the dust, but men whose principal object in life is to thrust their hands into the treasury chest are not likely to have much heart for other things until their purpose is accomplished When they In e grasped the coin they may turn aside to worry an antagonist or insult the representative of their Quite, but then motto is " Business first, pleasure afterwards " An amendment to the address will be moved to day by Mr Beeby in the ordinary form, and the natural consequences will follow in due course It is plain, however, that we owe this determination not to any regard for light or constitutional practice or common decency but simply to a conviction that the ordinary course of procedure is the shortest cut to place and pay Our only object in calling attention to the incendiary paragraph on which we have commented is to impress our readers with a sense of the dangers to which the community is exposed " Berryism ' is once more in the assert that, this time with hypocritical professions of moderation and willing less to compromise on its lips, but with the old malignity and insolence in its heart The idea that people who are not its disciples have legal rights to be respected is utterly abhorrent to its instincts Its first impulse on meeting with opposition of any sort is to ride i slashed over everything and everybody in its way It is not content with the successful assertion of its own will Its Happiness is not complete unless it can Jack its antagonists after knocking them down If "Berryite "moderation should continue to develop as i q idly as it has done since Thursday last, this ought to be a fine country for the working " man and everyone else - before long A peculiarity of the Radical party is that of reaping where it has not sown, and gathering where it has not thawed In Parliament last week Mr Dow and other members of the Left were emphatic in taking credit to themselves that they had shown their contempt for payment of members by voting against the Service Ministry in the late Parliament, and pro joking a dissolution Here they declare the country has evidence that it is not the pieces of gold which the represen games are concerned about, buC the principle, and here they river we have testimony that pecuniary considera- tions do not away hon. members We are asked to admire the heroism shown by the radical party in putting payment of members behind it and electing to do the right thing by voting against the Ministry All this would be very pretty were it only true, but, unfortunately, history reads the other way The fate of the Service Ministry hung in the balance so long as the fate of the Payment of Members Bill was un certain If the Government had taken up payment of members, there is a shrewd suspicion indeed, it is positively affirmed that a majority for the second reading of the Reform Bill could have been readily obtained This may or may not be the case, but without special items on possibilities, what the public is concerned with is the fact that when the radical as ty elected to vote solidly against the Reform Bill it had become palpable that without a change of Government there could be no payment of members. The Payment of Members Bill was practically lost when the Government declined to father it. It was very well known that with out the full weight of Ministerial influence behind the bill no such measure had a chance in the Council, and the patriots who desired to dip their hands into the Treasury were quick to realise the situation they took the position in at a glance They saw that the bill would be lost in the Upper House, and that the Service Government would not dream of the trek to the Yppropn its jn Bill and the consequent deadlock which Mr. B Fry has Buicc 01 only promised, and which, no doubt, was privately understood at the time T i keep the Ministry in office was to kill payment of members, and what remained for the patriots was to strain every nerve to eject the Government, and every nerve was strained not, however, with the intention of gowD to the country, but in the belief that a new Ministry, favourable to payment of members, would be obtained without imposing on hon. members that painful ordeal No doubt a dissolution had to be risked, bultho party preferred to run the list rather than to submit to the certainty of a deprivation of salary for three years. The hon members could not be worse off, and they might be better We are willing to confer isolate these hungry gentlemen upon the cu cumstance that their prospects hay of un proved, but to their self flattery that they played an independent part, careless of self, and thinking only of principle, the strongest objection must be taken They turned upon the leader who would not promise payment of members or a dead lock and they rallied round the leader who would and did make the promise The game they played, from first to last, was one of "grab Victorian protectionists are invited to regard as " a hopeful sign of the times that Mr H E Ki\o, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, has been giving a lecture at Brisbane on the general subject of protection Judging from the statements and arguments contained in his discourse, Mr King is not likely to prove a very valuable ally to the cause of monopoly and beauty He told his head as, for example, that By xxviii riiAMtLiN, who was supposed to know " something about political economy, was a protectionist, whereas these were the philosophers sentiments "It were to be wished that commerce were at " free between all the nations of the " world as between the several counties " of England, so would all, bymutualcom animation, obtain more enjoyment ' Mr King further informs us that " on " three occasions in the history of the " United States was a free trade tariff tried in 1810,1833, andl84G-and on " each occasion the experiment, for such it was in that country, was an utter " failure " To show the complete in accuracy of this gentleman, it is only necessary to mention that the first daily for protection was adopted in 1896 that the tariff of 1833 42, was a revenue tariff, that that of 1840 was of a similar character, and that, in the words of Colonel Grosvenor, Absolute free " trade this country has never tried The " lowest ad valorem tariffs have operated " to some extent as a tax upon all in dishes, and as an encouragement to " many Ever since our Government had " being, it has been making artificial " conditions for trade and industry Mr Kiï.0 further asserts that so terrible was the distress in the seven years from " 1846 to 1854 that it was a common " observation that free trade had brought " greater miseries than war ' Now, these were actually years of protection , so that the Queensland Speaker has been drawing right conclusions from wrong promises But the whole of his lecture is so replete with blunders of this kind that we can hardly avoid the suspicion that it was prepared for him by some free trader, who was either bent upon perpetrating a practical joke, or upon bringing protectionist principles into disrepute, by cramming them shallow and ignorant champion with " false facts ' In either case, we think the cause Mr King has espoused will not profit much by the championship of a gentleman who must be very ill informed upon the subject on the one hand, a very credulous on the other Parliament will be opened to day at 2 o'clock as already intimated His 1 delicacy was indisposed yesterday and unable to come to town but it is expected that he will be able to take part in the ceremony to day The speech which His 1 excellence will deliver will naturally under the circumstances boa very short one and in fact, will do little more than intimate that the finances of the country are more prompt consideration and express the hope that after the full discussion reform has received the House will find itself able to deal with the subject In the event of an amendment upon the address being carried Ministers will at once place their resignations in the li inda of His 1 Excellency We may add that the State ments which have appeared that Ministers were d vided upon the question of what action they should take with regard to the motion of Friday last are quite unfounded and can only be made to come in the failure of that proceeding Ministers have neither been embarrassed nor divided but have steadily adhered to their ordinal and in mi mous determination of meeting the House and of retiring so soon as a constitutional vote of no confidence is arrived at 1 he drift of political affairs is still towards the formation of a Government by Mr Berry from the ranks of the direct Opposition Strenuous efforts have been made by a section of the radical party to bring about the formation of a coalition Ministry in which Mr Bent and a const tutions le 11er y\ he would be either Mr Francis or Mr Murray Smith would name man and man and from which Sir John O'Shanassy should he excluded 1 here has been no v firm response from either side to these overtures If Mr Berry forms a Government he has now only three men to select out of the eight Monsters in the Assembly Messrs Berry V C Smith J B Patterson Dow an 1 le Richard son will form the body of the Ministry There must be two law officers and only one lay member will remain for selection In deference to the views of a section of his supporters Mr J Perry has put himself in common cation with Mr Wrixon who has been named as Attorney General but it is as yet uncertain whether that gentleman will take (the post Moreover Sir Boan 0 Lotlilcn s claims for either the position of Attorney General or of agent general are being strongly pressed Unless Sir Bryan 01 oghlen goes to London, it is said

The Opposition caucus yesterday was well attended Sir John O'Shanassy and friends were present. The leaders of t party have somewhat drawn back from the first position, and do not mean, as has be threatened, to compel the Governor directly recognise the validity of, ida). vote Instead, the constitutional course w be taken of moving an amendment upon the address in reply Mr Berry submitted the text of a motion, repeating last Friday declaration of no confidence and upon it great deal of discussion took place Sir John O'Shanassy strongly objected to one of its terms, but the member for the fast was not Supported, arm gave way in order to secure unanimity of action TI afternoon was spent in debating these point and the subject of the relation which S John O'Shanassy is to occupy with regard the new Ministry was not mooted M Berry moves the no confidence motion, an the present intention of the party is to avoid discussion and to come to a division ? once The appointment of the board to deal with the Lord charges has been delayed by cr cumstances over which the Government has no control It is intended however, t gazette the board to day and it will be con- vinced of Mr J Munro, chairman Mr o Warrington Rogers, Q.C., and Mr. J I31j the Mr Patterson, relieving officer has been appointed pro tem as clerk of courts c Avoca to fill the vacancy occasioned by the sudden death of Mr Will A few day before his death Mr Wall made application for a retiring allowance but he was no a classified servant, and the application could not be entertained Judge Hackett being still an invalid, his duties will be performed by Judge Nolan a Ballarat, Beaufort, and Smythesdale, on the 27th, 29th, and 30th mats and at Clunes and Creswick on the 3rd and 4th prox A special meeting of the Exhibition commissioners was held yesterday, to determine formally what the relations between the ore cutive committee and the special committee should be The report of the executive which substantially proposed that each special committee should have full power to arrange the exhibits in its own department subject to the approval of the executive was adopted in an amended form The committees were authorised to exercise their special knowledge, under the direction and control of the executive, in whom supreme control was vested, in order to prevent confusion and conflict of jurisdiction amongst the special! committees Mr Justice Higinbotham heard a number of summonses in chambers in the Supreme Court yesterday.

The numerous addresses which His Excellency received from both branches of the Legislature, the representative societies of the commercial and agricultural interests, and other public bodies, show that Sir G C Strahan had won the affection and esteem of all sections of the community during the four years of his governorship of the V Windward Islands On his arrival in Barbadoes the public mind was greatly facilitated by a variety of peculiar circumstances which had helped to render his predecessor, Mr (now Sir Pope Hennessy), very unpopular but Major Strahan, by the exercise of more than ordinary tact, judgment, and ability, and by his straightforward policy and evident desire to act for the good of the country, succeeded in restoring public order in inspiring a feeling of security, and contributing to harmonious relations between the two branches of the Legislature in their addresses the Legislative Council and Assembly cordially recognise the ability and tact displayed by the Governor, and state that they heard of his intending departure with unfeigned regret This regret is reciprocated by His Excellency, who, however, believes that his transference to another sphere of duty in a more temperate climate will be beneficial to him Speaking of His Excellency, the Went Indian remarks " Something more has been done during Major Strahan a administration than the maintenance of authority and order, and the restoration of quiet and confidence, important as this work was to give a basis for measures for the reform and improvement of the public institutions Amongst these two have been passed the want of which has long been felt one for the establishment of a general system of public education, and the other for the amendment of the laws relating to poor relief The passing of these two men sures especially the former, is enough to justify the claim of Major Sfciahans administration to be remembered as one of the most successful in the annals of Barbados But in addition to this we may observe Major Strahan took a personal interest in the progress of education Nor was the influence of the Governor a presence and encouragement felt only in the school, but also mother places where if they were not more welcome, they were not less beneficial-in visits to the gaols and asylums and in the supervision of the public departments Sir G C Strahan left Barbadoes for England by the mail steamer on May 28 A correspondent writes by the mail on June 17 -" All colonial cricketers who have had dealings with the Surrey veteran, James Southerton, who in his time has been batsman and fast and slow bowler, but who has made his mark in the latter department, will regret to hear of the Surrey professional side cease Southerton was in good health a few days ago but succumbed to the effects of the wretched weather, pleurisy and congestion of the lungs carrying him off A special service of thanksgiving for the arrival of the Right Rev Dr Pearson, who is on his way to take charge of the bishopric of Newcastle NSW, was held at All Saints Church, East St. Kilda, last night The Right Rev Dr Moorhouse, Bishop of Melbourne, the Right Rev Dr Thornton, Bishop of Ballarat and the Very Rev. the Dean of Melbourne were present and in response to the bishop's invitation about forty of the clergy of the diocese attended. The service was full choral The anthem selected was "Now we are ambassadors and How lovely are the measen gers, from Mendelssohn's St Paul The first lesson was read by the Bishop of Ballarat, and the second by the Bishop of Melbourne The sermon was preached by the Bishop of Newcastle, who selected as his text Romans mi 5, and preached a brief but impressive discourse He spoke grate full of the kind reception accorded to him viewing it not merely as evidence of kindly feeling to himself, but as an earnest of a desire on the part of churchmen in Victoria to rise above personal local, and diocesan interests, and extend their sympathies to the people among whom he was going no observed that if the new comer missed here those grand antiquities which centuries of Christian civilisation had left in England he saw on the other hand many cheering signs of Christian energy The bishop glanced cursorily at the growth of the colonies within the brief space of time that has elapsed since they comprised but an arch deaconate in the. bishopric of Calcutta and concluded with an earnest exhortation to his bearers to take courage from the past to rise above petty interests; Co avoid the men i pursuit of wealth and of selfish aims and to cultivate that feeling of brotherhood am . goodwill to their fellow churchmen here and everywhere which would enable them to. attain to a practical realisation of the mean urges the text, " We being many are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another " The English Nonconformist and Indepn do not June 10 gives some particulars as to circumstances under which the Rev.

Thomas Jones in Melbourne was consequently considered by the reverend gentleman as very opportune At the next meeting of the members of Clapton Park Church Mr Hebditch, with the approval of his deacons introduced the subject, and Sir Charles Reed moved the following resolution -"That the church has heard with deep regret the circumstances under which its beloved pastor is compelled to leave England for a lengthened season and most heartily sympathises with him and his family in the domestic anxiety which renders this step ne cessary Although the church deeply feels the temporary privation which it will thereby undergo it cannot but approve the course which has been resolved upon and therefore with much affection commits its dear friend to the keeping of God, earnestly praying that his voyage may be prosperous, that his ministry in the colony may be useful, and that he may return in due time to the people of his charge in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ, bringing with him Ina beloved f milly in health and safety line was seconded by Mr Henry Child, the senior deacon, and after addresses by the Revs S M'All, George Wilkins, Messrs M Young and Colley it was carried unanimously Mr Hebditch has been pastor of the Clapton park Church for eight years Every sitting in the spacious building has been filled under his ministry and a large number of persons had been waiting for a considerable time to find accommodation He is a passenger for Melbourne by the s.s.

The estate of Mr Y Y Bailliere of Collins street, publisher, was placed in the Insolvent Court yesterday The liabilities are set down in the schedule at £1,517 12s 3d , the assets at £339 10s and the deficiency at £1,178 2s 3d The principal creditors mentioned are as follow Mr Beaney, £220 for law costs, Aaron Waxman, money lender, £2 >0 , God free and Bullen, solicitors £130 for law costs L Brock, clerk, £130 forwards, J G Duffett, solicitor, £80, for law costs Mr James Lawrence was sued in the County Court yesterday by Edward Frank W alters for £150 damages for trespass and unlawful conversion of plaintiff s goods It appeared from the evidence that in April last the plaintiff rented a house in Young street from the defendant and then owed £11 rent, but defendant held a watch and chain as part security for the debt Da fendant sent word to the plaintiff that he must pay him £7 and leave the premises by the 20th April, and on that day the plaintiff moved from the house, about 100 yards away in Napier street, without paying what he owed Lawrence On the 6th May Lawrence s bailiff distrained on the goods of Walters in the house in Napier street, and removed some of them, which were sold by an auctioneer for between £10 and £11 Tor the I plaintiff it was submitted that defendant had no right to follow the goods but on the other hand, it was contended that under the third section of the Landlord and Tenants Statute the defendant could follow the goods and diagram on them within 30 days from the time they were removed from his house In reply to the latter argument, it was stated that a landlord could not follow goods unless they had been removed fraudulently or clan destiny and that they had not been so removed in this case His Honour Judge Cope left it to the jury of four who heard the case to decide as to whether or not the goods were removed in a fraudulent or clandestine manner and the jury after retiring for about half an hour, returned into court with a verdict for the defendant in order to encourage the regular attendance of children at the state schools under their control, the West Melbourne Board of Advice have decided after the next Christmas examinations to give a printed circular to each child who has attended a certain nurse, her of any s during the six or nine months previous to the examinations and a certificate to every child who obtains full passes at the results examinations during the year A person named Fairhurst who is periodically troubled with the wrongs under which the working men of Victoria suffer called a meeting of the unemployed yesterday to be held on the vacant piece of ground near the Supreme Court Though the contents of the meeting, in a harangue which lasted for nearly an hour, expressed himself ready to champion their cause, the unemployed did not seem to have much confidence in him, for there were never more than "50 persons present, and the majority of those who attended were attracted by curiosity The first resolution which declared that it was time the reform question was settled and that the meeting had faith in the scheme proposed by Mr Berry, was seconded and carried Mr E Fairhurst then moved the following resolution -"We believe the powers possessed by bankers, merchants, squatters, professional men, the press, land jobbers contractors, and others is such as to prevent any thing like just and equitable laws being obtained, to the great injury of the industrial classes ' for this resolution there was no seconder, though one person and he would second it if

by this time those present had become tired of his reading and the meeting broke up into groups and dispersed In view of the approaching election of councillors, the ratepayers of Collingwood held a meeting last night at the Londonderry Hotel to discuss the question of rates Mr L P Aumont was voted to the chair, and explained that the meeting was not called to condemn the members of the present council, but to enforce upon those about to be elected the importance of reducing the rates Mr Upton moved a resolution to the effect that the meeting was of opinion that the rate for the ensuing year should not exceed Is 01 in the £, and pledging itself to support only those candidates who would uphold that view He thought that a 13 ed rate was quite as much as the property in the district coal i pay, and mentioned that less public improv e ments had been made by the council with a Is 6d rate than formerly with a Is (id rate At present over £2,000 was in the bank, and half the last rate

The chair was occupied by Mr H Walker, the president of the club About 40 gentlemen sat down to an excellent dinner After the usual loyal toasts had been given the toast of kindred clubs and the officers of the Fitzroy Bowling Club were received with much cheering the company enjoyed a very pleasant evening many of the members enlivening" the proceedings with Burns excellent songs The kiddie I viewing Ne' i of Wednesday says -' The 10 escapees from the French convict settlement New Caledonia who were arrested in Queensland and forwarded to Sydney under warrant of extradition signed by the I lieutenant Governor (the Hon J I Bell) arrived early yesterday morning by the steamer Victoria and are now incarcerated in Darling hurst Gaol awaiting the departure of the next steamer for New Caledonia The prisoners represent two gangs of escapees of five each and they escaped from the convict settlement on the 4th and 7th or 8th of May last Upon arriving in Queensland they reported themselves to be communists but this has since been found to be a misrepresentation by the French consul in Sydney who has received official information of their being" 10 of the worst description of criminals Since the appro ' her sion of these casual eyes the French consul in Sydney has been advised of the escape of eight other notorious) criminals from New Caledonia It is considered probable that they have made for some part of Northern Australia and will if they arrive safely, describe themselves as communists as in the mv amiable custom of all 1 lives of criminals in escaping from the criminal settlement It may be of interest to state that since the decision of the Government of 1 rance to liberate all communists from transport unions in New Caledonia there now only remain some 200 of that class of prisoners on the island, and they will leave as soon as they are enabled to do so, nearly the whole of the number returning to France ' At a time when attention is being paid to the necessity which exists for the protection t Australian ports in case of war, the South At strahan Jicgutcr observes, the safety of the cable at Port Darwin is worthy of consideration At present it is entirely at the mercy of any hostile power for half a mile outside the station at that port it is not more than 3ft under water at high tides with its course plainly marked, whilst at low water it is quite bare, There is nothing to prevent its being destroyed, together with the bat tents and instruments, by a small party of armed men Not is the duplication of the cable any safeguard, as from the position of the second line it would be as easily rendered useless as the first. It is impossible to contemplate without dismay such an event as the severing of the electric communication between Australia and Europe Even in ordinary times the contingency is one to be dreaded, and in times of war it would assume the dimensions of a national disaster As we have not yet arrived at that satisfactory stage of affairs at which the electric telegraph lines will be secured by the operation of international law it is necessary that special measures for their protection should be taken Any system of colonial defence which leaves Port Darwin out of account must necessarily be defective And as every colony is equally interested with South Australia in maintaining communication with the outer world, the subject affords a fresh illustration of the need for joint colonial action We trust that in the steps which are now being taken to place the dependencies of the Empire in a position of defence countries curate with the gigantic interests at stake this matter will receive attention, and that the telegraph cable will be placed out of the way of temptation and beyond the reach of danger" Respecting the movements of the ex Empress 1 agent in South Africa, the Times of Natal writes -"Of the progress of the Empress in Zululand we can say little, on account of her well known desire to avoid publicity, but we learn that the sad duty which she had taken upon herself was performed with touching and impressive solemnity On arrival at Ityotyosi, on the 1st of June, the anniversary the death of the Prince, those of the Roman Catholic faith who accompanied the Empress were invited to join in a solemn service after which they retired and on the night of that day the Empress alone watched and prayed over the spot where her son had fallen Funereal papers together with the wreath of immortelles sent by the Queen and the Prince of Wales, were placed upon the spot, and the Empress also placed the like sacred emblems on the graves of the troopers and of the Basutos who fell with the Prince We are glad to learn that the Empress preserved her health throughout, and that no difficulties of a serious character were on countered The party visited many other places of note on their journey, and Sir Evelyn Wood caused the remains of an officer, which he discovered, to be interred A London correspondent sends us the following interesting particulars of a recent sale of music copy rights - At the sale just concluded by Messrs.

The sale occupied six days, and realised upwards of £10,000 Many persons who went to the opera last night were greatly disappointed at the announcement which met them before entering the theatre, stating that in consequence of the indisposition of Madame Boema Mozart's Don Giovanni could not be predicted and that in its stead Verdi's Rigoletto would be produced A great number turned away but nevertheless a numerous audience remained to witness the performance of Rigoletto, and had every reason to be satisfied with the entertainment provided for them The cast was the same as that which we have noticed quite recently and each singer was in good voice and well disposed towards the part of the work allotted The result was an effective ensemble in an opera of high class, but nevertheless one which is rarely witnessed, and to have seen and heard it played and sung as it was last night will be looked upon in future lime as amongst the valued recollections of the ever evinced Melbourne opera goer of his day Madame Hersee and Mr G Verdi the Gilda and Rigoletto respectively of the night received the honour of a double recall after the grand duet with which the third and concludeD Signor Coy was encored for singing ' La Donna e Mobile The quartett " Un di bi hear Pammenter was given irreproachable well and the audience generally were loud in their expressions of approval If this were the beginning instead of the end of a season, we would point out that the management of the stage lights during the storm scene in tins opera Rigoletto, was not artistic The managers assure us that Don Giovanni will be produced tonight and tomorrow night, and that with this performance the 1 resent attempt to provide grand operator the Melbourne public will come to an end.
