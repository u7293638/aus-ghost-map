POETRY. Vox Populi- When Uncle Joshua was struck with palsy unawares, He quietly give up tbe ghost an' left two sons an' hetrs; An' one was Jacob, short an' fat; Uriah was tbe lean 'un; They had, I reckon, something like ten thousand plunks bstween 'em. When Jacob got bis sheer, he tuk some of his wife B relation An' set 'em up in trade, an' wuz their gin'ral salvation; He left his latch-string hangin' out, an' all hands wue invited, An' every tramp just smacked his lips when Jacob's house was sighted. He started up a grocery store, an' all the poor he trusted ; An', lo'n' behold 1 the sheriff come, an' Jacob—he wuz busted ! Tbe people winked an' nudged theirselves, an' then the story started About the tarnal fool that from his money soon was parted. « * * » Uriah tuk his thousac's an 1 invested them in ile, An' it wuzn't many months afore he'd made a thunderin' pile; An'*he built a costly mansion on the highest hill in town, An' in many ways he tried to be a pueson of renown. He sent his boys to college, an' his girls acro3t tbe sea, An' spent s->me hundred dollars lookin' up his family tree. He contributed an organ to the 'Piscopalyum church— Fer a public sperriteder man you'd hev a lengthy search. But ih people all despised him fer his money an' his pride, An' when amid his luxuries he laid him down ai' died, The men who greeted him in life by takin' off their hats Thanked Heaven fer one lees of them in. fernal plutocrat*.
