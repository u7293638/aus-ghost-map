WIT AND HUMOR. A VERT NAKROW ESCAPE. All the ghost, murder, and explosion stories had been told, and thon a grizzly old captain took a fresh chew of tobacco and observed:— " The narrowest escape I ever saw was that of a man who came here in the hold' of a vessel loaded with pig iron.- He crept into the vessel when she was empty, and; went to sleep, and when they came to load 1 her they covered him up with iron, suppose there wasn't less than 600 tons of the stuff on top of him, and he was in that position for seven or eight days with, nothiog to eat or drink. When they got 1 down to him they took him out, and a more surprised lot of dock wollopers you never saw." " How did he work it ?" was asked. " Work what 1" " Why, how did he escape h crushed ?" " He was crusted. He was as flat and thin as that there sail." " I don't see where tho narrow 'scape, comes in, then," said the lineman. " Well, I do," continued the narrator, " and so would you if you had seen them just take, him out. through a seam in the side of the boat." •Then the meeting broke up.— Chicago Herald.
