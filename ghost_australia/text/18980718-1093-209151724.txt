TATTERSALL'S RACES. THE HANDICAP WON BY BERKS GATE. THE STEEPLECHASE ANNEXED BY STOCKINGS. GKASSMEKE KILLED. After the welcome fall of rain on Friday the committee of Tattersall's Club were put out of suspense and the chances of a postponement by the early appearance of Old Sol on Saturday morning. The couditiouof weather permit ting" had special significance in connection with the fixture, as the club has on two or three occa sions previously had to postpone their meeting on account o£ rain. Luckily on the present occasion the jjluvial discharge was just sufficient to place the running track in jgood going order, and for the jumping ; races nothing could have been better I than the soft yielding turf with hardly a par j tide of mud. The attendance was up to the | average of Tattersall's meetings, and £7,793 os. passed through the totalizator as com pared with 110, (if 5 ICS. last year. Two big dividends rewarded the followers of Stockings and Cigarette, the former paying £23 3s., and the latter £17 0s. The course looked very nice and attractive to the eye when the sun was brightening the mantle of green that now forms so strong a contrast to ; the long-prevailing brown bare hue that our ; park lands have worn for two or three seasons. j When the A.B.C. Grand Xational meeting; comes on for public attention the course will! be in first-dass going order, and nothing could be complained of as to the state of things on Saturday. Viceroyalty was represented by Captain Wallingtou, and the Ministry by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, whilst many ladies graced the grand stand reserve, and some nice costumes were noted as their wearers were promenading the lawn. The tedium of the intervals was re lieved by the Loco. Band, under con ductor Hopf, and luncheon and after noon tea, supplied by Mr. C. A. Marten, gave a refreshing break to the decorous dulness that prevails on our courses now, where the tongue of the layer of odds must not be heard. An English visitor who has witnessed racing in all parts of the world was particularly strong in his excla mations of surprise that at a meet ing held by the principal betting club in the colony a bookmaker was not allowed to open his mouth to a would-be client. The "racing afforded big fields and fair speculation. The Trial .Stakes opened with 13 runners. Orb being the favorite, I but the winner turned up in Mr. W. A. j Blackler's Gratuity, who won comfortably | from Louise and Muscadine, and paid a j dividend of £0 9s. The wiuner has been in ] private training by Mr. Blackler, and was ridden by Deveney. Being by Richmond— Gratitude she is a filly that will not be parted with, but is destined to ornament the Fulham Bark stud, and it will be remembered that her brother, Broken, Hill has an Australian Cup to his credit amongst other victories. The Hurdle Race saw 14 candidates face the starter with Albury Queen and Kronberg the pair most in demand, and the public were not wrong in their selection, as the representative of Patter son's stable went well and strong throughout and by the aid of T. Barnes scored Dr. Stewart a well-deserved victory, paying £55s. dividend, and having Little Martin and Barton as her nearest attendants in the places, Kronberg was fourth and The Bishop, who hit his stifle badly, was fifth. TatteraalTs Handicap was the next event on the card, when the fourteen colored sported silk, and Birksgate, Viking, and Goodwill were supported in the order named, and finished nearly as they were backed, expect that Goodwill beat Viking for second place. Birksgate had the services of Teddy Hodgkins, who rode a good race, and won it; paying a dividend of £3 13s. to the followers of Tom Kiely's stable, this being the third race in succession that Birksgate has won after many disappointing seconds and thirds. \ The Steeplehase produced a field of 13, and • Happy .Jack had the call in the market, ; Ensign being also well supported. Why j Stockings was overlooked was probably be- j cause it was supposed he was in pickle for the Grand National, and even j his rider, Alf Heed, did not think I much of his chance, Mr. Ryder's gelding, j however, simply spread-eagled his field and won as he liked from Happy Jack and I.X.L., i and paid the splendid dividend of £23 3s. I Father Confessor and Florida both fell, and . Grassmere came down so badly tbat he injured ! bis spine and had to be shot. The Federation I Handicap produced a field of eight runners, j with hurore a better favorite than j Cicero, but the latter cot home first, | and beat Louise and Tarsus for places. ! It was hard luck for her owner that Louise ; should have twice run into second place on the • same afternoon, especially as it was considered there was a Likelihoood of Mr. Crozier's horses I being scratched on Saturday'. Calloghan, j the boy on Louise, rode remarkably j well to get as near as he did j to Hodgkins, who rode the winner. ! The July Handicap brought a dozen starters j to tiie past with Gnullo a prime favorite, but j the ever dangerous Cigarette cropped up again f and by the aid of Burn in the saddle scored a ; win from Quiclcshot and Gnullo, paying the j very acceptable dividend of £17.!)s. j The following were the results :— I TRIAL STAKES.
