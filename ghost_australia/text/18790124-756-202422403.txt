Mqj, YE YEARS 1 " the ffhst of a feeling, . Tis but the ghost of a smile ; Gone us- the true light revealing This but a shadoio the while. Thus shall each rose-tinted vision Fade/as the leaves in the Fall, \- Leaving, it may he, derision Casting a gleam o'er the pall. Years glide along -without number (Svvift as a wind-driven wave), Hiding away in its slumber Much we would struggle to save. Taking the bloom from the roses, Taking the down from the peach ; Leaving the thorn from the posies, Leaving the ashes of each. Bringing the end of our dreaming, Bounding the sphere of our life ; Tinting with shades of new meaning Harshness of pain or of strife. "Waking our souls from delusion, Chasing-the shadows that throng ; Piercing the vale .of illusion, Sighting full many a wrong. Scattering the false that would cluster Only when fortune is fair ; ' Shrining with ever more lustre . Love that all danger would dare. , Testing the true from the faithless, Tearing the mask from deceit ; Leaving but fe w that are scathless, Few — but how preciously sweet ! Thanks, then, each year that unveileth Tenderness, courage, aud truth ; And for the rest — what availeth ? Take them, ye years, with our youth !
