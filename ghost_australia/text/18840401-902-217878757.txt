The lord of such vast treasures plundered on the high seas was fain to beg the Court to' let him have for his subsistence and defence £50 out of the money, which had been found upon him. That Kidd did at least on one occasion bury treasure in America is a fact beyond dispute. He landed at a place called Gardiner's Island, and requested Mrs. Gardiner, the wife of the proprietor of the island, to prepare a supper for himself and his comrades. The lady took great pains with the repast, and the bandit of the day was so pleased with his entertainment that, on his departure, he made Mrs. Gardiner a present of a coverlet of velvet, richly wrought with gold. A fragment of this coverlet is still in the Gardiner family. It was during another visit to the island that Kidd, in the presence of Mr. Gardiner, and after swearing him to secrecy, buried a casket containing 750 ounces weight of gold, in coins, dust, and bars ; 506 ounces of silver, and about 16 ounces of precious stones. When Kidd was arrested in New York in 1699, he made a discovery to Lord Bellamont, the Governor of the colony, of the place of concealment of this casket, which, was duly exhumed and surrendered to the Government. The re-- ceipt for it is extant. A prodigious treasure has been lying for more than 180 years at the bottom of Vigo Bay. The merest tyro in the study of English history is aware that on the 11th October, 1702, the French fleet and the Spanish galleons in the Port of Vigo were attacked by the combined English and Dutch fleets, under the gallant Admiral Sir George Rooke. Short work was made of the French fleet, commanded by Chatel- herault, and of the Spanish shore batteries by the Duke of Ormonde, who with 2,500 Grenadiers had landed about six miles from Vigo. The French, seeing the day was lost, burnt or ran ashore 10 of their ships to save them from capture ; but Rooke captured 10 of their war vessels and n Spanish galleons sent home from the Indies full to their poop lanterns of booty of war. Seven millions sterling worth of gold pieces of eight, pillar dollars, plate, and rich commodities fell into the hands of the victors ; but 14 millions sterling worth of treasure in six galleons went to the bottom. Rooke, being now joined by another ' old salt ' as heroic as himself, by the name of Sir Cloudesly Shovell, left that officer to dismantle the fortifications and bring home, the prizes, and sailed for Eng- land with his prize money, in triumph. Some of the vanished treasures may have been re- covered, but still the blue waters of the bay hide bullion enough to make hundreds of speculators rich beyond the dreams of avarice. The sea has a habit of holding its own very tightly indeed — whether its ' take ' be gold, silver, precious stones, ironclads, anchors, or dead men's bones.
