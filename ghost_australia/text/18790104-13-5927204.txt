in such a "way as to giittfy then suppoiteis " This is a consideiation which the " Colonial Societal), if he deals with " the mattei at all, should not ov er " look " But this is the -v ery kernel of the question, because the leal object of the Ministi) is to obtain absolute control of the geneial revenue and expon dituie of the colony, without any lestiaint on the palt of the Legislative Council on the one hand, 01 of "lgno " nnt ploughmen" and such like com mon taxpajeis on the othei Of cow se, when these stnctuies were watten m London, nothing could be know n of htei developments , such, for example, as the libeial piopositions foi a eompi omise submitted by the leadei of the Opposition m the Assembly, and the aiiml of Sir MICHAEL HICK.S BL \CH sdespatch,whichoughttohave put an extingiushci on the "embassy' pio ject, and would lme ddllo so if the eomimssioneis had not been so ob stinately bent upon having a costly holiday jaunt to England and back at the expense of the taxpajeis Neithei could the editoi» of The Times and the Tall Mall Get elie have possibly foie seen that all the Llustei about constitu tional îefoim wasutteilj insincere, and that upon the eve of " this new departuie " -this great step of going in the name " of this gi eat colony of Victona to the " Imperial Go\ eminent, as Mi BLRR\ giandiloquently phiased his fool s ei rand, he Ind publ ely announced that what he meant to ask the Colonial Secietaiy to do would be this, "to let the lands of " the colony como into the hands of the " vast majority of the people " In fact, English journalists fall into the not unnatural erior of assuming that w e ha'* e statesmen at the head of affairs in this colony, and if nothing else comes of Mr BMVRY'S journey, it will undoubtedly have the effect of unde ceivmg them in this respect-at any late, m so far as he is concerned Un fortunately the character of the colony suffers also in the person of its light headed îepresontative, who is regarded in England as coming thither on a fruitless oirand, as well as at an mop portuno time Tho interest of the general newa ka3 been pictt} well destroyed b) lato tele grams, and this remark

This fellow, who appears to be a brother of STEVE HART, the outlaw, was brought up at the police court charged with using threatening lan- guage. Taking up a position near the courthouse, he proclaimed that “ he did “ not care a —— for all the traps in “ Mansfield, and that if he were locked “ up he would, upon his liberation, join “ the Kellys ; that he was a friend “ of the outlaws, and sympathised with “ them.” He pleaded that he was drunk, and did not know what he was saying, but two constables swore that he was perfectly sober when arrested. The magistrates appear to have credited his story in preference to the sworn testimony of the police, for they imposed the paltry fine of 5s., or six hours’ imprisonment — a lighter penalty than a common drunkard swearing at large might expect to receive. He should at the least have been smartly fined, and required to obtain sureties for his good conduct for the next six months. The sequel is, according to the telegram received last night from our Mansfield correspondent that the fellow “ after doing his six hours’ imprisonment, went away on horseback,” with the intention apparently of carrying out his threat. He has been re-arrested with other supposed friends of the Kellys, and he is under strong suspicion as an accomplice of the gang. The events which have followed so quickly on the original proceedings throw into still stronger light the mis- guided leniency of the Bench, but their proceedings upon the facts originally brought before them must excite the gravest remonstrance. Considering the disturbed condition if the district, it is essential that all demonstrations in favour of the Kelly gang should be repressed in the sternest possible manner, and that the police in prosecuting ruffians of the Hart type, should have all the sympathy and support which magistrates can give. If society is to be menaced with impu- unity, Hart will not be without imitators, who will argue that the authorities hold them in dread, and will thus be en- couraged in giving to the outlaws that aid which is so valuable to them in eluding the pursuit of justice. The Mansfield magistrates, in dealing with HART, committed a grave error. We trust that should they ever have to deal with similar cases, they will be more alive to their duties and to the obligations they owe to society. ____________________________________ The submarine cable still leiiuuns inter rupted bejond Batavia and up to latent advices no Btcnwci had arrived with telo grams from Singapore Hie l'oit Darwin line was mteirupted last night north of lennnnt s Creels 'Hie 1 MS S Tanjore Caplnm \\\ V, rentimau, anchored in the baj at half past 8 o clock jesterday morning from Galle whence she sailed on the 1.1th ult with the mails from Lngland and the Last lhe lau jore rando a smart run lound of 3u hours fiom Glenelg to the Heute, and possibly from this aa well as from some other unexplained cause, it happened that there w as no intima- tion ¿hen of her having passed the signal stations at Cape Otway or Queeenscliff Had she been a Kuasinn causer ahe could not have been let more scierel) alono On approaching Cape Otwa) about li o clock on Thursday nicht, the usual signals were made, namely, show u\¿ a blue light for« aid and another aft four times at mtcrvala of live minutes and blowing the steam whistle, and the steamer waa within three miles and a halt of Cape Otu a) on pass nig it Again, the earliest information re ceiv ed at Vi llhamatown fiom Queenscliff with íegard to the Tanjorc was aftei half past 7 o tlocl in the morning by v» Inch time ahe w is in sight coming up from the South Channel Amongst the passcngeia bj the Tanjoie were Mesars I!
