The Wallsend Band was again presen»., j and provided sweet strains to while away the intervals between the different events. Betting was pretty brisk, and honors were ibout equally divided between backers and layers as a couple of surprises turned up for the latter. As a whole the racing was close, and reflected credit upon Mr. Qninton's handicapping. The offloials were again busily engaged at their posts, and gave every satis- faction. Dr. Nash is becoming proficient with the starter's flag, but he is not yet quick enough to take opportunities. Mr. Cowcher was secretary, and that is sufficient proof that everything went merrily and correctly. It was somewhat strange to see the usually popular Plattsburg Handicap only biing out three horses, one less that half of those nominated. The local representative Carlyle was made favourite, and after a lot of finessing Sir Ronald was in greater request than his companion Locksley, whose price showed that his chance was considered a poor one. However 'tis the unexpected which always happens : Carlyle cut up very badly, and the out- sider could not go slow enough for Sir Ronald, and won easily, without being asked. Seven horses went to the poat for the Disposal Plato, and the speedy Torrent was selected as a cut above the others and so he proved, for he won comfortably from Accident and Zenonia, who is a terrible jade. Then the Jockey Club Handicap came on for dis- cussion. The easy win of Sir Francis on Thursday paralysed betting to a certain extent, but still four or five of tho nine who answered the bell to go to the post were nibbled at. The groy horse followed his tactics of Thursday, and as soon as the flag fell he jumped off in front, and there he remained until the winning post was reached, Jack Roarty being second, and Drilldool third. At one time ;4- i"~i-j\\_ .* ii « ... lookottX as if the former would win, but the rac\ was never in danger, as the handsome grey ann of Chevalier and East Lynne had too much pace for any of his opponents. Not- j withstanding that the prize for the Prince of Wales Stakes was .£100, Mr. Mayo"was the only one who had the temerity to oppose the all-conquering l'orront, and that gentleman sent the voteran Erin to the post, and he went there favourite too, for his good deeds in the post were not forgotten. It looked any odds on Torrent during the first portion of the journey, but he stopped as if shot after reaching six furlongs, and Erin beat him in a canter. The last item on the programme was the Tramway Handicap, for which seven of the eleven on the card sported silk. Summerhill and If were the popular selections, but neither of them had a ghost of a show, and Adam won easily from Gesundheit and Malicho.
