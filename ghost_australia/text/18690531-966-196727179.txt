gwtrjj, (Prisma Mil MtM AGAIN. Oh, sweet and fair! oh, rich and rare! That day so long ago, The Autumn's sunshine everywhere, To heather all aglow; The ferns were clad in cloth of gold, The waves sang on the shore; Such suns will shine, such waves will sing, Forever, evermore. Oh, fit and few! oh, tried and true! The friends who meet that day, Each one the other's spirit knew; And so in earnest plav The hours flewpast, until at last The twilight kissed the shor ; We said, " Such days shall come again Forever, evermore.'" One day again, no cloud of pain A shadow o'er us cast. And vet we strove in vain—in vain To conjure up the past; Like, but unlike ths sun that shone, The waved that beat the shore, The words we said, the songs we sung, Like—unlike—evermore. For ghosts unseen crept in between, And, when our songs flowedfree, Sang discords in an undertone, And marred the harmony. "The past is ours, not yours," they said, "The waves that beat the shore, " Though like the same, are not the same, " Oh. never, nevermore!" —Eraser's Magazine.
