Whose Was tlie Hand? . . St Mies Braddoit, . . ? Jkatiute of 'Lady Audley'B Secret/' &c; CHAPTER XXL— {Coktindbd.} ~ CJSfa Arden felt' weighed down toy the sense at inexpreeeible Badness as she «at looking: out into the rfloonlit garden — that garden which she and 6%r first lover had found a, wilderness, and which he hifl made into a paradise for her sake. It was, hergiriipb. admiration of that old garden by the river vrhioh. had made Robert Hatrell eftger io Bosaessthe nlace. He had laid it a* her f&t; afl ig it were a bunch of rases, never counting the east of anything whieh pleased her. Had It been tea ttawf as costly a place he would have bought ft for her. Bis image was with her to-night more vividly than it had been for a long time. It was as if he himself were at hand; in all the warmth and energy, of -life, and that she had but to stretch -aut- her arms to beckon him- to her. And, .oh! with what a heart-riobneBs of longing and regret she turned towards that idoupea image ! B'a«e to faoe with the inexplicable gloom of Ambrose Arden'e temper, ahe recalled her fir ^t husband's happy nature, his joyous ?utlook, and keen delight in life. With him her days had jsef mod, one perpetual holiday. If she ever com* plaajied it had. been because that energetic temperament took lite and its enjoyments at a faster paoe than Buited her own reposeful temper. But how bright, how gay those days had been ; how frank and open her companion's face ; how expansive his speech and manner ! He had never hidden a oare from her. Were his thoughts light or heavy she shared them, and knew every desire of her. heart. ; Hut in this man, this cherished friend of many years,.- she had discovered mysteries. He hnd .griefs' which he would not share with her. He was angry with his only . eon ; they had parted within a few hour*, perhaps f «r all this life ; and be. would tell her nothing of the cause of their parting; be invited no sympathy. He sat by her side in melancholy silenoo, and she felt the bur den of unhappineEs which she was not allowed to share. ' If he would only talk of hia trouble, if lie would only let me comfort him, I should be twice as good a wife,' she thought despondingly. ' It is not my fault if our lives are growing farther apart.' After this night an emotionless mcnatooy marked Clara ArSea's days in the house whore hvr early married life had been so full of happi ness, and where her one great sorrow, the sorrow of a lifetime, had come upon her. The idea of going on the coatiaent for the autumn was net carried out. The scholar's book absorbed him wholly in- the waning of the year, and he pre ferred the quiet of Eivor Lawn to all the glory of. the Italian Lakes er all the art of Florence. He epent a good many hours Qf every day in ^i» old cottage study, while his wife and bar daughter lived very much as they had lived in Mrs. Hat rell'a widawhobd. ' Your sBCond marriage and my engagement to Cyril seam almost a dream, mother, when you and I are sitting here &1©»« together, and TJnele Ambrose is poring over his books on the other side pf the ro%d,' said Daisy, sw ate Bflt t»t ^'T moth^p'p fee*' in fhft n'Arniuer toom, pretending to nad J^ff* ^SPW under the Georges, but loekiag nn eveif tfm #cp thfitt to talk, ' I call Mm ^uife ft i&kf;&GSit;* \ Band in hia way— nSver i^flo^ witfriaap ! pUus, neyer grumb}in* a* hjfl ^Jn&ajr;, #*«?!* courteous aqd kind, attd ***djr fc- do wja*,i»ft u'ke'.^ ?'????

No one at IJiver Lawn knew anything about Cyril's whereabouts, unless it was his father. He had left Lamfprd within a few hours of his inter view with Daisy, taking with him only a single portmanteau, as Beatrice p,aardpn informed her friend, this young lady baying a hgbjt pf mee^jng every &y; that ever entered or departed from the village. 'rIfs no use you telling: me you haven't quar relled,' protested Beatrice, when Daisy denied all ill-feeling between Cyril and herself, ' I saw the poor dear fellow's white face as he drove by, acknowledging my bpw in the most distracted manner ? and I never saw such a change in any man. A few hours before he bad been the gayest pf us all on the tennis lawn, and now he looked positively like his own ghost. You must have had a dreadful row, Daisy?' 'We had no row, as you call \$. 'J¥e only agreed that it was better for us to part.' ' Poor Cyril ! I had no idea he was so despe rately in love with you. He used to take things so very easily,' remarked Beatrice, with all the freedom of friendship. ?? Of course I alwayp sus pected you of not caring a straw for him. You were not the least like an engaged girl. You didn't spoon him a little bit.' Daisy shuddered. ?3he *yas one of the few girls ?wihn are revolted bv euch forms of eneech as era rail in some girlish circles. Miss Bear'don affected a fast and slangy manner as a kind of perpetual protest against the dulness and mono tony of her life in a Bertshirp village. She wanted everybody to understand that there was nothing rustic or pastoral about her mind or her manners. ^ This was all that Daisy heard about Cyril's departure. He liad j-oiie to i;i» ^twtnDerg xuost likely, where he cpuld prap^r« »t his leisur* for that l«.ug voyage of which, he had talked. The greater part of his possessions, Id* bp?k« and guae, ^nd sporting taclle of all kinds wore in the Albany.

I can but be grateful to Providence that He has re leased me from a bond that could not have brought real happiness to either Cyril or me, and looking back now at the past I feel how cowardly I was in not daring all and telling him the truth about my own feelings. He was no coward. When the hour came in which he felt he ought to break with me, there was no hesitation or wavering on his side; and yet I believe* he loved me better in that parting hour than he kad ever loved me in-his life before. 3?«or Cyril — old friend and playfellow — I hope the young Australian will be kind and true, and that his life in that far ?world may be full of all good things; gold in monster nuggets, sheep in mighty nocks, horses that are not buckjumpers, woods of eucalyptus, groves of mimosa, birds of vivid plumage, and the most perfect thing in bungalows. I am really very sad about Uncle Ambrose. I think he fights against the gloom that gathers round him as a strong man stricken in the prime of life by some insidious malady might fight against disease ; and yet the gloom deepens. With him low spirits seem actually a disease ; and I tremble and turn cold sometimes at the thought that it may f orbode some mental malady which may darken all our days. My mother Beldom, if ever, sees him as I Bee him when she is not present. When she is with him I knew that he makes a stupendous effort to appear cheerful, to seem interested in the things she loves ; but when she leaveB him the mask drops, and I see him as he really is — a man weighed down by deep-rooted melancholy. I have talked to him of the boftks I used to read with him. the low-spirited school of meta physicians, and of Heine, who saw all things with the saddened eyes of a man -whose ' life was like Pope's, 'a long disease.' We have talked of theology, and I have discovered the hopelessness of his creed — that for him there is nothing beyond this life of ours, this poor brief life, in which there are so many chances of being miserable against a single chance of being happy. 'No, for him there is no beyond — for him the dead are verily dead. I told him yesterday that I believe not only in a world where we should meet ©ur loved and lost, and know them again, and live with them again in a better and loftier state of being ; but that I also believe in the influence of our beloved dead upon our thoughts and actions even while we are Q» this side of the veil that parts flesh and spirit. ** That influence is only memory,' lie said; ' it has no other source than your own mind — moved by your own loving heart.' I told him that it was something more than memory — something independent of my own mind or my own heart — an influence that flashed upon me when least I expected it — sudden, mysterious, full of suggestions of another world. . I told him that them were moments in which I could feel that my father was with me, that he was loving and pitying me in my weakness as a woman, just as he used to pity me when I was a foolish child. ' A delusion, Daisy/' he said, ' a delusion like the rest of our dreams. Science has made an end of all such deceptions, The belief in a apirit world was only possible while mankind remained densely ignorant of the world of sense.' ?' I know new why you grow sadder as life goes on,' I said. ' It must be s« hard to feel that you are treading a path that only leads to a dead wall. That there is no door in the great cruel wall, no beyond. Thank God, to me it is harder to believe in extinction than in a world to come — a chain of worlds, if you will — a gradual ascent from this life., with all its sin and misery, to the highest form of life conceivable. The most elabo rate ef thoEe systems which you call superstitions seems simpler and easier tor my understanding than the barren creed of the materialist.' ?' That is because you are young, Daisy, and full of enthusiasm, and because you know very little of the -world in which you are one happy atom — a joyous mote dancing in the sunshine. You think life is the gift o| a beneficent Creator, who holds in reserve future lives, fairer than this for those who believe, iu Him and obey i-figi. That pretty creed comes naturally enough to you wh»know life only at EiverLawn an-i inGrosvenor Square — but go and look at life in Whitecbapel, put yourself into the skin of the women you will see there, and then ask yourself about the beneficent Creator, the Eternal Wisdom, Who has made man in His own image. Your rose-water theories would hardly be strong enough to stand that atmosphere. A Bradlaugh's vitriol better suits the district.' I told him that it was an old, old argument that because there was so much misery in the world He who made it could not be a just God. ; or rather that there could be no directing mind above the universe, only unreasoning' matter working out its own destiny upon material and immutable laws— that the God who could be moved to pity was th_e God Qf children and visionaries only. ' You talk to me as if there had been no misery in my life,' I said. ' Do you forget what it was to me, in my happy childhppd, to see the father I loved go out of thiB house one morning, and never to see him again ? Do you forget what it was to me a year ago to hear the dreadful secret of his death. If I could rebel against the Power to which I have prayed ever since I knew what prayer meant, I should have rebelled then.' I could apt go on for the sobs that choked me at the thought of my father's cruel death. Uncle Ambrose melted in a moment, and toot me in his arms, just as he would have done years ago in one of my childish troubles, and pressed liis lipi 'inon my' forehead with a kiss that seemed like a blessing. \-- iipxxbve, my dearest, he said, 'keep always that unquestioning faith which iB the gift of the pure in spirit. It is a second sight, Daisy, ft ie a sixth sense. It is given to the chosen few, God's very elect. To them it is given to con ceive and understand the unseen. They are the children of light. Se always of that happy race Dai6y. My reason has nothing to offer in ex change for your clairvoyance. 8*iuember always that if I could not kelp you to believe — if I could not enter with you into the holy of holies, I never taught you to fiaubt.' 'No, no. , I have only known lately that you yourself were without the hope that has sus tained mother, and me in our dark hours.' 'A little hint of your mother's has helped me to guess your secret, Daisy,' he said, 'and I love you too well to blame your inconstancy. Your mother and I both think that Mr. Flores tan bad something to dp with the change in your sentiments.' ' Something to do with my finding out th« truth about my own heart/' I said, f'and the nature of my mistake. I did not love Cyril less after I had seen. Mr. Florestan, and found out spmehbw that he cared for me,. But I knew all at once'that my love for Cyril had never been the kind of lovp that would make me his happy wife. I found out that he could never be more to me than a dear and valued friend — never so much to me as you have been. He could never be the first; and one's husband ought to be the first; in pne'e heart anid mind,* ought he not, Uncle Ambrose, as mother's husband was 9' X felt so sorry for my thoughtless words when J. saw him wince at the mention pf my father's name. It was such a heartless thing to say. There was an awkward silence, and then Uncle Ambrose went on gravely and' qjaietly, 'w#h infi nite kindness— ~ ' I want my PUPU a&4 adopted daughter to be happy, even if she cannpt be bound any nearer to m» by a new tie. Don't be afraid to trust me, Daisy. Remember I was your first friend — after your father and mother, and that you used to tpll me all your tlifughjte and (ancipi.
