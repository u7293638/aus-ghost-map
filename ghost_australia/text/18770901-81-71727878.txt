Tho more I searched about, tho, less .. could,-my hands light on anything,' s'avo ' the sloppy earth. The voice, had quito , ceased now, so l bad rio guide from; that. ' ::-While I Stood trying to peer into thc '.

It wus ! ' dark nguiu in a moment, but I mado my way with unorring instinct. Sure enough, there lay a poor little child. Whether boy or girl I could not tell. It seemed to bo'three parts inseusiblo now, as I took it up, dripping with wot, from the sloppy earth. "My poor little thing 1" I said, as I hushed it ta me. "We'llgo and lind . Mammy. You aro all safe now." And in answer, tho child just put out . its feeble hand, moaned once, and nestled "1 close to mc. ;...'.' \<i With the child hushed to my breast, I rodo on.

Hardly daring to lift the' latch, while my poor tired horso stood still und mute outside,'I went slowly in, tho child iniiny arms esvored «ver with tho.' Hap bf 'my long coat. My wife was weeping . bitterly. , , " What's umiss ?" I asked in a faint voice. . And it seoined that a whole ... chorus of voices answered me. . ''.Dolly's lost." ' Dolly lost!
