Hints on Onions. I have, sown (says an American farmer); onion seed on the same land for eight years, and the - crop has improved every year. Spread on thick ly rotted .manure, plough, under,- pulverise .tho roughly, rake with an iron-tooth rake, and mark oil' the drills fifteen inches apart. Sow unleach ed wood ashes in drills at the rate of forty .bu shels, per acre. Sow seed on. the ashes ánd cover. I have no trouble .with wormst. or maggots. Uuleached wood ashes and onions'are great friends. Cultivate four or five, times, keep-, lng the soil loose and mellow, and'.free from weeds, and keep the soil well drawn up around the onions. In. planting large bulbs which bunch; or make a number of small bulbs, caro should be taken to put a handful of dirt in the middle of each bunch, as, they grow and spread apart, as they will do much better ánd grow larger. . _ A curious thing about a young duck is the ease with which it can be drowned by a heavy rain. Until.their feathers get started a hard rain will drown them, as soon as it will a chicken. When caught out in the rain, they will stand with their heads up and mouths open, and soon give-up tho ghost; After the feathers start there ls no dan ger from anything, of this kind. , .
