BY DONALD CAMERON Author of "Scripopolis," &c.;, &c.; No condition can be more terrible than that of a person who finds himself unknown unnoticed, uncared for, in a city where once he was the observed of all observers, . the worshipped of the worshippers.

For Flora, had not been epaxed- The "eentility" of Sydney (heaven ; save ns!) on hearing of the bursting of I the great bubble, had at once declared that ' they knew all nlonf? what wa* coming; < they hud prophesied it, and ihey only, marvelled how anyone could be m> stupid i as not to see what was tho matter. A blind man, they said, could have seen that the extravagance and display of Mrs. Leigh i must land her huabwd in the insolvent conrt or the gaol. All this Flora had i heard in her lodgings, irfccro she was ?a- : mown, and wheru iihe bad gives a falsi name — & name afterwards fatod to Ik? of great fame —Agatha Arden. And lira.
