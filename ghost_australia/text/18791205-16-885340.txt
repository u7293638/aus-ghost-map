Northern Lights. III. In trying to avoid a dry narratn e of travel over ground too well generally known to moko auy new description palatable reading to your sub- scribers, I am afraid that I have drifted about in an erratic and purposclosa fashion, going back- wards and forwards, just in the order of my " pen cillmgs by tlio way," without making any attempt whatever at consecutivo narration of tilinga acen or heard or impressions received I have not the faintest idea whore I last loft oft , hut, while waiting for the pilot Bchoonor to take mo from the steamer at Brook island-an arrangement by which, thanks to the courtesy of the authorities» I am able to Bave a week s valuable time-a good opportunity appears to offer of gi\ mg the results of an enquiry which I repeatedly made while in Cooktown as to the extent of tendency shown by tho Chinese to become porimuont cultivators of the soil I refer now not to the mero cabbage-garden work in which here as elsewhere in the colony they largely engage, but to crops which involve cousi lerable time to maturo, and require that tho land shall be held upon a secure and permuuent tenure The information obtained leaves no doubt that Chinese capital will in time be largely employed in developing the resources of our rich northern soils Ibey aro a people who keep their own counsel a good deal, behoving moro iu working than iu talking of what they are going to do, ind therefore the exact scope und extent of aome embryo pla hw Inch are in process of hatching is uuLuowu A merchant of Cooktown wie, hiw e\er, able to give mo all the partieuUra of one project, as he had been a party to the agreement f or c irrymg it out A firm or copartnership, with u capital of £2ÍO0, with moro available if wanted, has commenced operations upou 610 acres of rich land near Cairns Hem 1 may digress to say that both at Cairus and Port Doughs, and on the MosBUian and others rivers of those dtotneUî, there have been many sélections mideof rich bottom landa fit for, and winch will probably be ipi lied to, tho cultivntun of various tropical products What the eultu itors aro going to do for labor is not clear , but I have not the least belief that the wilderness of this part of Queensland ib not destined to be subdued by means of whitu labor UnleBB our go\ orniug men are prepared to see millions of acres of land of the higheBt capabilities going to waste iu thtso lnti tudes, the restrictions upon colored labor inuBt be mitigated, and I do not hesitate to express the opinion that there are many reasoiiB of public policy why they should bo relaxed, while thcro are no grounds of objection, eitlu r religious, soei ii, or moral, which could not bo roni ivod by wiae regulations It ia the certainty of sullieienc labor of the right kind, upon which ho eau de peud, whieh will give the Chinese capitalist tlio pull overourown moneyed men in cultivating the coast lands of these parts The pvrticular con- cern to which I am alluding has already (,ot iifty hands on the land, mid thirteen tons of e,oods, chiefly rice, have just followed The intention is to grow sugar and cotton , but my informant could not tell me how they proposu to manufac- ture their sugar, or upon v» lint tlioy base the expect »lion that cotton will ault tlio chmato The land 108 been selected by a naturalised Chinaman, in whoso name it stands, but how the interest of the other mombors is secured does not appear, although I have no doubt that there is somo code of honor or form of bond among tho Chinese wlneh secuies theBO people in that respect 1'hero aro a hunched shares in the concern, of the valuo of £21 each, but I could not learn by how many individuals the shares are held 'lhere appears to bo no doubt either m the Chinese or Luropeau mind that tho project will succeed, and I hope, both for the sake of the colony and of tho enterprising pioneers themaelves, that it may. Another evidence of permanent settlement is to be been lu a gaiden, about eight unka fiom Cooktown, belonging to one Lee Si and paitner 1 hanks to the good offices of an old frioud, I waa enabled not only to see this place, but to ovimiuo it thoroughly under the guidante of a \ery intelligent Chinaman, one of tlio pro- prietors The farm buildings compuso n commodious and clean dwelling, wlieie we were hospitably euteitained with tea, beor, blandy, and sundry fruits, sheds, stables, bain, and inon's huts, all Hiifli cieutly aubatantial to give an air of peiinanency to the place The total area of the land, the fee Biinplo of which is vested in one of the partners, is about 100 acres, of which 50 aro m a atute of high cultivation Tlioy grow bananas, which ira exported to Townsville, Itocklmmptoii, und Sydney-and very fino, indeed, they ure There are also large plots of pineapples and many hun- dreds of young orango trees BeaideB these, I saw cocoanut«, peaches, lemons, citrons, sweet potatoes, water melonB, sugar cane, ground nuts, tomatoes, ginger, aud maiyo The appearance of c\ery'lnug was healthy, and at the time of my visit they were harvesting a very good erop of corn I also saw some hundreds of bimbi In of ground nuts, the produce of the season s crop, bagged ready for the Palmer, where the trow ers find their chief market for this Chinese luxury The farm is prettily situated on the Lndeavour river, and constitutes one of the few pitches of good Boil near Cooktown The carnage is all done by water, and m this as in other pirticuhrs economy and good management seem to govern the whole concern Although I had nothing particular to do at Cardwell, it happened to suit mo to take that place eil route for the Lower Hprbert , and I am exceedingly glad that I did so The town con siats of a somewhat straggling clufter of houses, of which the chief are Government buildings-of the rem under not a few are empty, or put to other uses than those for which they wup built The ghosts of departed prosperous times are to be Been in legenda of all kinds over, and it the sides of, doors-whirk once gave admission to business depots 1 bus you see the names of men who have long left the place or are dead, and occupations described for which there is no longer room Cardwell ih now a quiet hamlet, of a little over a hundred inhabitants, with a certain air of sleepy hollow about it, but for all thal a charming little place Beuitifully situated upon»a sandy beach, open to every breath of the aea-bree/», it ia reputed a pleasiut and healthful place in which to live-a repute which is quite borne out by tho ap- pearance of the inhabitants Tho great drawback to its proapenty has been the tre mendous range of mountains which hem it in from the back country , and so when othet and easier approaches to the seaboard were dis covered Cardwell gradually subsided from a promising township to the peaceful Milage which it now is and bids fair to remain 'Hie one or two Btores partake largely of the charactei known as "marine," and it l8 difficult to undeistand how they are supported The same may be said of the one bank and one hotel of tho place , but as baukers and hotelkeepers least, of all traders like to keep open at a loss, it is presumable that business sufficient for their ambition comes to them The hotel at least deserves bucccph, for a more comfortable houso I have rarely stopped at In one, about the only good garden in the place, there was shown abundant evidence of the suit ableness of the climate for tropical horticulture The mango here is a giant shade tree, while around it may be seen in robust growth the Java almond, the alligator pear, the breadfruit, cashew nut, jujube, &c; The cocoanut also grows splendidly, and trees of all sizes from a foot high to specimens in full fruit are to be seen looking wonderfully at home But I must not dismiss Cardwell without a reference to the glorious groups of trees on the beach These These trees, which have no easier name by which to describe them than Calophyllum, are, and with great justice, among the notabilities of the place The tree is not purely a Queenslander, being found in some other tropical countries, but its habitat in Australia is very restricted, and it appears to be somewhat fanciful about adapting itself to other localities where the climatic con ditions are nearly similar The fact, however, that fresb water of the purest character is found a few feet from the surface, close down to the beach, may have something to do with this. The foliage is very large and of a glossy rich dark green ; and these conditions, iu conjunction with a remarkable spread of the branches, make the Calophyllum one of tho finest shade treea of the world. By actual measurement I found n soli- tary specimen to spread its branches 60ft. one way and 66ft. the other,' and, the foliage being very dense, your readers may picture to them- selves the glorious refuge thus provided from a tropical sun. I hope that the mouths of the few but valuable, colonists in the Moretons who lay themselves out for shade-tree growing will not water over my description- alas ! all too poor of this marvel of nature, as I regret to have to add that it would not look at their southern climate, and can therefore only be admired at a distance. Through the courtesy of the principal Govern- ment officer at Cardwell-and here let mo add, with grateful acknowledgments, that similar courtesy has been extended to me throughout my travels by all public servants with whom I have come in contact-a passage in the pilot cutter, which had business at Townsville, was placed at my disposal aa fur as DungoneSB. As the river ia necessniily governed in large measure by tho tide, it was past midday beforo wo weighed anchor ; and although we lind wind and tide in our favor we were compelled, when the latter failed us, to anchor for the night, reaching Dun- geness tho next day towards afternoon, after a dead boat from Haycock island. Tho channel lies the whole way between Hinchinbrook island and the mainland, and the passago ¡b one long succession of charming views and vistas. The frequont change of form, and the varying eleva- tion of the ranges and spurs of Hinchinbrook, present aoinethinj fresh for the eye to rcat upon at every fathom of progress; and it is hardly necessary to ndd that the tropical character of the foliage, its changeful color from tholighteatanil brightest green to au almost black effect, produced partly by foliage and partly by shade, strikingly intensify | the interest of i he scene. The effect« described aro confined to n comparatively narrow strip of undulating land near the water, anil they are again marvellously ouhuueed by n sternly rugged background of rocky mouutaiuous country, full of crags and precipice inacccssiblo even to a goat The grand ell'ects of the high land, in moro than one spot observable from the water, wero enlivened by considerable waterfalls tearing dowu the face of tho mountains, apparently by magic, iib they Bcemod to find their way to day- light from the very highest sumuiiU. follow- ing tho waterfalls with the eye until they lott themselves in the denso vegetation of the gorges and lower slopes, the scene waa clumped, as by the optical delusion of a dissolving view, into the Boft rich characteristics of palm foliage inter- spersed with vnriously.tiuted and all densely clothed trees and shrubs, many of them in full blossom, and curiously confused by the featooning habit of climbing plants innu- merable But for the inexorable demands of time and tide, and for the probability that the banks of the Herbert river, where I wau about to sojourn for some ilityB, would present similar foutui-os, the temptation to land would have boon irresistible. Dungeness for tho present, al- though I shall hnvo to revert to it, may be dis- missed with the remark tlint it consists of au inhospitablo sandspit, with a store, a wharf, and two dwelling-houses, none of which aro at all Becuro from possible demolition, or at least isola- tion, tho effects of flood und shifting Band. Having written the word " inhospitable," lot it remain to express what was intended, but the hospitality of the inhabitants of this dreary Bpot. was Btrikingly exemplified by a letter left for our party by one of them, in which, whilo npologising for his absence from home, ho told lia where hu had loft his keys, and placed bia house and cup- board unreservedly at our disposal. Fortunately for our kind friend, tlio resources of the cutter in the way of creature comforts had beou ample ; so, a boat mauued by stalwart islander« being in waiting, wo went on our way rejoicing, and in about three hours I was welcomed to a haven of peace and rost, where I soon rid uiyself of a condition of fatigue and uuwnshcduesa en- gendered by the almost uninterruptedly wakeful voyaging of the previous twenty-seven hours. Thoro is no bettor way of learning tho bad fit of a shoe Ullin by trying it on, and Retting one's own too pinched. Tho peoplo of tho Lowor Herbert nre either very unfortunately situated or vory badly used. With local política I have nothing to do, and do not meddle ; but I may observe that it must bo extremely tantalising to thom, and must heavily handicap tlioin in their business, that, while a weekly mail passes thoir door to Cairns, Poit Douglas, and Cooktown, thoy receivo their letters once ii fortnight only by ii branch lino from Townsville. As I write, I um conscious of tho pleasing fact that a batch of letters for myself, which it is of exceptional moment to me to get, arrived at Townsville to- day, where they will peacefully sojourn in tho poat olucc for one whole week beforo they nie forwarded, and cannot reach mo for nine dayH. It would seem as though the distriot wero with- out friends at headquarters,. for on the top of this manifest disadvantage under which they lie, compared with their neighbors north aud south, Dungeness is doomed as n port of entry, and the Herbert settlers will be forced to transact their Customs business at Cardwell at a largely in- creased outlay of time and money. But for the traditional interest of Cardwell, and its sub stantial Government buildings, it is obvious to the most cursory observation that the progrèss) of the colony and tho interests of the commerce of the coast would neither of thom bo affected if that exceedingly pretty spot wero again aban doned to the blackfellow and the alligator. Tub entomologist Iia3 become a recognised feature of the American agricultural syetom. But it was a long time beforo the results of his investigations attracted attention. Now, however, there is a very general disposition to take advan- tage of the knowledge he has acquired of the habits and modes of life of destructive insects, aud also to call in the aid of the mechanical genius to assist the farmer and gardener in clearing off the pesta that attnek vegetation. One of tho fiercest enemies of the American planter in former years waa the cotton moth, the pareut of a small caterpillar or grub that was fearfully mischievous. About twenty year» since this little pest caused vast stretches of cotton land in tho Carolinas and Georgia to be abandoned. So persistent aud destructive were its attacks that the land waB put under grass and grazing was attempted, but did not Biicceed, the soil being too sandy and light. Now, thanks to the labora of the entomologist, the peat ia kept under sufficiently to, allow cotton culture to proceed again. Tho cotton moth (Lmcania unipuncta), being a night flyer, ¡h readily attracted by light, and the following is the plan adopted for ita destruction ¡-Pans filled with molasses are set out upon poBts in the fields, and a light in a lantern is hung over each pan, or placed upon a piece of wood ur a brick set in the pan. The cotton moth and auother enemy, the AUtia, argyllucc'i, fly towards the light, and perish in shoals in the treacle. A correspondent informed readers of the Quccni/nnticr recently of a means of stopping the progress of travelling caterpillars (at times very destructive in this country) by opeuing furrows across the line of their march. Into these furrowa the invaders drop, and are destroyed either by covering them with a second furrow or by burning straw, brush, &c;, over them. An improvement upon this plan is suggested in the form of an oil-drum or other vessel of iron that would lit the furrow. A charcoal fire is kindled in tho thurn, which when sufficiently hot is dragged by a chain through the furrow, killing every living thing as it goes, and leaving the t-ides smooth for other victimato crawl in and bo similarly treated. To cope with the potato beetle, various devices are described, Paris green, though very effective, has been found dangerous to thoBe who applied it, and has consequently gone out of favor. A machine has lately been introduced which covers one or moro rows of potatoei, and travels upon wheels which run betweeu the rows. Over each row of pota- toes are arranged a series of revolving wispa or beaters, that knock off the beetles, which then fall into troughs set upon the machine and run- ning close into each side of the rows of potatoes The troughs are either filled with sticky matter to hold the beetles, or the insects are shaken backwards by the machine and crushed "to manure " between a pair of rollers. By the foregoi-g and other measures insects which at different times threatened to swamp great in- dustries are circumvented and destroyed ; the means adopted for their destruction being more or le=s based upon a knowledge of the habits of , the insects acquired by the observing entorno ogist.
