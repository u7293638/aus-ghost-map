The Storyteller. THE SPLENDID PORSENNA. CHAPTER XVIII.—(Continued.) By Mrs. HUGH ERASER. Author of "A Chapter of Accidents," "The Looms of Time." "A Diplomatist's Wife in Japan," &c.; Honora must have dozed in her weariness and hunger, for she jumped up with a start to find her sofa moved some seven or eight inches from the door, a bright light shining tbrougb, and an arm reaching in to lift the sofa still further. They were light to lift, she and the little one, and the man was strong and flushed with wine. In a moment he had entered, and stood over them, red-eyed, smiling loowly, but quite ci-ect and steady. " Homore, pretty little monkey, it's all right, isn't it ? You know you love me. Qome, give us a kiss, and let toyegones be byegones !" He stooped down, and his vinous breath touched her. In an instant she had bounded across the room, and was standing agahut the further wall, a fold of her skirt dragged •up round the child. What was he going to do ? He began to edge slowly round the room to where she etood. She moved on, and he moved faster, Suddenly be was at her side, with one hand pointing to the door, and the other holding a shining barrel to his child's head. She wheeled like lightning, and put her person between the child and the weapon. Then she felt the cold round mouth laid to the back of her neck, and the word of com mand vas in her ear.  " Walk to the church !" For herself ? Oh no, we have seen what tho poor, brave gin thought of death. But for tho little hands that were even, now beating weakly at her breast for food, for the little head that began to lie so heavy on her acbing bosom—for them she obeyed. Some chance salvation might meeTvher at a turn- Ing, at a doorway, 'but—oh, Mother of Mercy, let it -come before she reached the church ! She knew without knowing what waited for her there ; at this hour no soul would be near, there would be no escape. She tried to cheat him, tried to turn to the left instead of the right; and then the cold kiss of the barrel went a little deeper into her neck, and she thought of the child left alone to his rage, and she went on. Gerald had been both painfully and Joy fully surprised by a telegram which had reached him on the afternoon of the twentieth. Fortunately, as he said to him self, he was alone when it came, and that save him time to decide quietly what should be done. If deciding quietly meant writing a wild note to his aunt, saying that he was sud denly called away by unforeseen business affairs, would write at once, would return in a few days, and finally hoped that she. would not wait dinner for him, as he might be detained, then it was perhaps fortunate that quiet decisions did not come to be made every day. This one further caused him to put some money in his pocket, rush down to a livery stable where he had sometimes hired horses, and ask for anything that could carry him at once to Oliveto In Sablna. The telegram was a curious one, and ran thus : " Come to Oliveto alone; tell nobody.— H." What on earth did it mean ? He could not tell, but he knew it was Honora sending to him—Honora, the dearest and purest of women. So she had something for him, and bfm alone, to do. This was good, and life was worth bearing. He had never been in those hills, and chafed at the long ascent, at the hour given to resting the horses before the rise began. It hod been late when he started, and the last time he lighted a match and looked at Ids watch it was past 2^n the morning. Then the carriage rattled~over some rough stones, along a smoother Bpace, stopped, and some one turned the handle of the door. He leaped down, and felt, more than saw, for the night was exceeding dark, a woman's figure standing close to him. .There was the touch of costly fur in his hand, the well-remembered breath of violets on the air, and little fingers, heavy with rings, were laid on his lips for silence. Dark ness took the veiled face, but he doubted not that it was Honor, wrapped in her sable cloak, who had come down herself to meet him, and tell him why he was wanted. What should he do but obey ? Sbe led him, a hand on his sleeve, and still silent, under a low doorway in an Invisible building, through what seemed a fearfully cold, damp passage, and up a step, all In darkness. Then, whispering hurriedly, " Wait," left him. Was that a door that shut with a snap ? Was it jpossible that he heard a. bolt run home to the rocket T Honor might have said two words to him, surely, might have thanked ■him for coming so promptly. What a very odd smell ; and what was this touching his hand ? Oh, a table-cloth—rough—lace. Hte fingers travelled on, exploring. A long table, very high, with two steps up to it, a candlestick—two—a reading desk, a cross. Why, it was a cUapel, of course. What a etrange place for an interview ! Then be ■was aware of movement —of steps and voices. Where ? Ah, THere was a flicker of light, now a steady stream, and he sprang forward in amazement at the sight that met his eyeß. Honora, dear Honora, was walking straight towards him, with eyes that looked steadily, first to the right; and then to the left, eeeit iug for salvation still. Her face was paler than it had 'been on her marriage morn, and a tiny thing that moaned was clasped in her arms. She hung back at every step, trot Orazio had his left hand on her shoulder, and with the right held something behind her bead. The other, Ibe false Honora, dressed in her sables ana jewels and per fumes, held a bright lamp high that they might see their way. She had thrown back her muffling veils. It was Virginie. Ten yards off a heavy stone had been raised and partly pushed back from ils place in the floor, and left a yawning pit of black ness, whence death breathed chokingly on the living. Words are slow things. Gerald aaw, gave a cry that rang through the emptiness, and- sprang forward, all in one flash of time. Honora's answering cry came ns he struck his head and hands «gainsT a .heavy iron grating that shut ■him off from her- He had <been brought there to see the end. As Honora's voice rang bnok to him, he. saw hope and colour and life rush in a flood to her face. She had been beard ! But no, Orazlo's right hand changed its place, and brought the revolver round to where the child's head lay against her. Gerald was trying to tear down the dividing bars, to tear down the church itself to reach her, and did not hear Omiio's cold words : "If you scream once nsorej I kill the child." Tben she stood still and spoke, putting awey the barrel with her hand, and wrap ping the little one closer and closer with all her person, her head bent ltfw to shield its bead. " She is your own child, Orazio, and I wa3 and- am your true wife. There Is not the shadow of a wrong between us, except that you hate me, and sec ! I ask your pardon for that! It was all my fault; I was young and stupid. . . . Forgive me if I angered you. I know . . Ob, have pity on us ! What havo we done ?" Gerald caught her tones, and he stopped la his frantic efforts at liberty. The words reached him, clear and pleading, in the tender voice be knew so well. Ortuio lowered his weapon and spoke. '■ Done ? Oh, I forgot, I had better tell you. Nothing so very much, after all. Only taken that caged animal there (oh, he counot get out, don't hope it) for your lever ; only despised me and hated me, and then betrayed me. That is all. It is going to stop now, and I thought he might like to see you before the last. Kiss your hand to him, my dear !" Gerald had not gone mad yet, strange to say. He hurled the candlesticks, the missal, the cross Itself, through the bars in the hope of reaching Orazio ; but the ironwork interfered with their impetus, and they fell short. Orazio laughed, aud pushed his wife a little nearer to the grating ; and Virginie, at a sign from her master, raised the light so that it fell on Gerald's agonised face and bleeding hands tearing at the heavy iron work in vain. Then Honor recognised him, and sprang forward with a joyful cry, .holding" out the child, toping to reach the bars with it in time. Gerald would save it somehow. But it was torn from her by Orazio, aud aa she flung herself upon him, he threw It back 13 Virginie, who wrapped her stolen furs around it and moved away. She had seen enough—her part was played. Hoh ora's shrleka rent the air, and prevented the woman from hearing Gerald's mad promises. He was telling her she should have every thing he had in the world if she would let him out. Orazio struck hla wife once and twice on the mouth to silence her. Then she was suddenly still, «nd, writhing, turned and kissed him as he held her, and murmured overy endearing word that love can frame into hi 3 ear. What wa« perjury, or hell, or eternity, if he would but let her go to the child ? But it was too late for that. He hardly felt the warm sweet lips on his, did not hear her words, or ccc her beauty fawning on 'him in the last wild hope of touching his senses and weakening his grip on her exhausted body. The low lights of madness burnt in his eyes. She might as well have kissed a lion on the blood trail. While Gerald's heart froze in his breast, bis eyes, alone free to follow, saw Orazio lift his wife sud denly and run with her to where the pit yawned black in the marble floor, saw him etoop and lay her over it, saw him tear her hands with, a breaking sound from his neck. Then there wad one more cry, a short fall, a rending of drapery, and the stone came scraping back to its place by reluctant Inches, for it was heavy. The murderers were gone, and a dead, still ness reigned in the desecrated church, where the darkness lay, iblack as the pall over a new-made nun. Gerald strained every nerve, tried to stop the very beating of his heart, to listen for a sound : but none came, nothing "broke the intense web of silence. He struck a match, and tried to peer through the bars in the direction of that awful stone. Alas ! he had flung the altar candles at Ora zio, and they had rolled far out of reach on the marble floor ; tout he thought, oi^ hoped he'thought, that the stone still pro jected crookedly, had not gone home to its place in the floor. Another match, his last but one, Bhowed him that, as he had feared, his grating reached the ceiling above in a curve follow ing that of the arcb, and was flxed to the wall with heavy hinges that all his wild shaking and rattling had not begun to dta lodge, while three separate locKr of antique and ponderous workmanship fastened his prison from that side. The small door by whitb he had entered with. Virginie was blind, and so heavy that It would not even shake in answer to his blows. This was the Porscnnas' private chapel, rich in irarblc and preciouß btones ; and it bad been forti fied accordingly. .One more thing he had seeu before hid match died. There was a square slab in the middle of the floor, marked " Nobilissimn familia Porsenna," and there were two iron rings in it, lying flat -with the pavement. Was it possible to reach her that way ? In an instant be was on his knees, tearing at the rings with his bruised bands, first on one side, then on the other, then, with a little cigar-cutter that be found in his pocket, carefully, scraping along the seams of the stone, loosening the coarse plaster that seemed to hold it, pulling at the. rings again, despairing, hoping,, in heavy dark ness, hie torn hands «nd streaming brow mfoistening the stones as he worked. At last he thought there was a ehifting in the point of resistance. Ho tore off his tweed jacket, and made it in£o a kind of rope through one of the rings, planted his feet firmly, and, with a cry that was half a prayer, put all his young strength into a mighty wrench ; and the stono came up wita a jerk which threw him a couple of yards against the wall of the chapel. Ho was up in a moment, and, on hands and knees, reached the edge in the dark nets. Then, lying at full length on the floor, he stretched one arm. down to feel, If possible, for what lay below. As hiß heed hung over into the abyss, following h<s searching hand, the ghost of a sound crept into his ears, and made hia heart stand still for a minute as he listened. Would it come again ? Yes, there ! The faintest whisper of a sigh, and something that stir red, far off. Then he made sure that she li\e<l, and that he would find her ; and to make all safe for bringing hoi* up there, he dragged the three covers from the altar, tied them in firm knots with his upper garments, aud made one end of the etrange line fast to the inexorable railing, then slowly let himself down with the other. Thank God ! his feet touched ground in a moment. He could reach the edge of tbe hole with his hand as he stood, for but shal low was the vault of the " nobilissimi familia." But, whichever way he moved, hie feet struck against something—he must light a match to find his way to Honora. It spluttered and went out ; but he had seen, across a grim pile of coffins, a square of blacker darkness in the wall, which meant an opening. Then, among the dead, he called loud and clear. " Honora, Honora ! I am coming. It is I-Gerald !" No answer came, and agaiu be called. " Honor, dear, answer, that I may know where you are." And a wall came to him out of that dnky mouth beyond tbe dead.~ Wild with joy and hope, be scrambled over the grim piles, and, stooping, passed under the low archway. For a few yards hands and head felt their way along and under dank stone with nameless growths of darkness. Then he could stand upright, and his arms -were free to leave his sideß. W-hat was thde? Had the daylight come? A long stretch of level earth, with form less, loosely covered piles on either hand. Overhead vaulted stones that dripped slow tears; and at the end, against further black ness, white and lambent, an arch of flame playing softly above a rough deal coffin. With empty arms flung across the boards, and eyes wild with straining for the child, Honora prayed such prayers as annihilate the decrees of heaven. With a cry he was at her side, was rais ing her to liips and heart. "■My own, my own, It has not killed you!" he sobbed brokenly. "The poor kind dead have not killed me," she said slowly. " No, not the poor dead." Then, with a voice that rang high through those damp places, she cried, "The living, the living! Where have they taken my child?" CHAPTER XIX. Slow and stormy dawned the day over the-eas'crn hills, and cold were the winds in the steep forest roads leading up to Oli veto. A poorly- dressed man, * carrying a bundle in a large red1 handkerchief, plodded along beside a Capuchin monk over short Cuts, sbiny with mud and fallen leaves. The man, bent *nd yellow-pale with cavernou« eyes, was the " Agglusta St-poleri," the pro fessional tender of church crypts, going round betimes i» the cool weather to bank up the neglected dead with kind covering earth, ftnd to make all snug for the winter. The monk was Padre Oamiano, climbing up ■to the white convent on the rocks for a few weeks of rest and refreshment. They talked as they went, in a few abort words, as people do who have walked far. " Shall you be long in Ollveto ?" asked Padre Pamiano of his companion. "No, it haa been a healthy eea»on, ami I was there six months ago. Nobody has died since but a baby or two and- the sordo muto, they aay, and him they put in a wooden coffin, as if he had been a great gentleman ! What extravagauce !" " Well, it makes your work lighter," said Padre Damiano. ".To make up for last time, Padre mio," said the man. " I had a heavy Job then ! Three day* was I down there, wKh my wife to help me, and we did not *yen come up for our meals. They brougnt our food into the church. There had been a fever—what do I know ?" • " It is early," «ald Padre Damiano, " and here we are." They had reached the church door, and he tried it. His face lighted up when Ivj found that it yielded to his push. " They are expecting me," said the poor man* ' 1 sent my boy on to say they could get the stone up last night. It is always such a business, and makes me lose lime." A slow rain was falling, and the monk's sandals made wet marks on the pavement as he adjaiiced reverently into the church. The gray morning was creeping in through high dusty windows far overhead. The monk's foot struck against a metal thing that rolled from him ; he stooped and picked up a candlestick, then another, then stood still and looked round. More than one sacred object luy on the stones. The crypt-tender stopped behind the^gouk nnti crossed himself. " They have beelrat it again," he said hoarsely ; " it was my fault for having the stone taken up before I came." " What do you mean ?" whispered the monk. "The poor little dead. Padre mio. They won't lie 6till sometimes.'* " "What folly !" said the monk. "The thieves inuet have got in ; God forgive tbem !" Their steps, their w,hisp<:rs, had brought new hoots and new fears to those two under trelr feet, among bhe dead, but not of them. Honora had uttered Chat cry for her child Just a« the church door opened. Gerald's hurrleO whisper besought her to be eilent ; it raisin be Orarlo returning. Oraslo had toft the stone awry, and at Iwo of its corners gray shafts of ligbt be gan to sink like new-driven piles into their datfcness. fThe arcfh of flame had died when daylight airs rushed through the church on 'Padre (Dasniano's eninranoe. They were wanted, for tbe atmosphere was indescrib able. 3  <Wi« crypt-tender shook bis head, and pull ed the monk <wHh him nearer the atone. He knew much about the w>ys of the dead, and he did not like the look of things. 'ttielp me puU it ejway. Padre ntfo," he pleaded. "See, it is neiuher on nor off." They stooped, got a good hold of the four corner*, and, with a strong push, slipped k weM off the opening, which now yawned, black and square at their feet. The crypt-tender gave one look down, thon flew Cram Jhe spot, up the steps of bhe high altar, and sank there In a terrified heap. The monk a.ood firm, crossed .htniself, and then stooped to Bee more. The man and woman, standing there,, white with their death-vligll, he dbalned, and bleeding, holding iher wi'.h one arm, <w<hUe lihe wtlher was raised to strike a last Wow for her life, were .two humau beings in dttrest etraSta. lOriminals fleeing <frora jus tice, perhaps, (Padre Damiano thought; but he fcnel* on 'ibe edge, and held out bis haud with the cruciifl*.that dangled from his long rosary, and said, "Peace, my son. Come up. I will not hurt you." With the help of Mb strong hands anil 'his rope-girdle, Honora was brought up first, white and speechless, wjtJh hard-set face, and eyes that caw not, would not see, till ihey rested -on her ravished treasure. Her fall had been broken by her dress, wihtch had caught and then ioru in ?.he stones, and she was not conscious of hurt received. (A. moment aifter Gerald stood be side her. and the monk held an arm of each (for they staggered, drunk with th-e poieons of the crypt) and called to the crypl tender to fetch water or wine—-whatever he could And in the sacristy. 'Before he could return Honora had breathed in one long breath of tihe blessed cold air blowing in wet gusts through the open door, and had sped lUce a lost arrow to the passage stair which led up into '-he palace. On its first turning a woman shrank back -with a frightened cry. It war Vlr ginie. Honora put her two little bands round Virglnie'B iibroat, and u.t ©red one word only, while "her eyes seemed to burn through Chose of the miserable girl in their question. " Where ?" she cried. " The tower —straight up !" gasped the girl; and as Honora rushed past uer wiMi the odours of death on her gamtemts, she leaned back against the wall and covered her eyes with her hands, moaning that Bho never knew the dead casne back —never, never knew it. On and up sped Honora, on -feet that were wings, calling and crying a*t every step.. " Coming, sweet, coming! Mother's com ing !" (Her voice, clear and high, might reach the Ibalbe <before she could.—oh, would these stairs never end ? Would those dizzy sMts never stop showing her how far baby would fall, should she stir up there ? A wetness" on her face, a level stone un der her feet, and she was on her knees, clasping :i<he small, dumb thing, all drenched and cold, i'.o the miracle of her mother heart. 'Helpless fell the little hands, burn- Ing and purple was the anouth, but the eyes know, and the head turned feebly taome to her breast. When they who loved ther followed, just on human (feet, and not oo those moxher wings, they stumbled over a small, object that rang sharp against the stoneo. It was a little gold dagger that she had (been used to pin her belt with. I'adre Damiano reached her first, and saw, then turned and motioned Gerald back. The little one's lips were red, and red the stream that trickled on the enow where its head was pillowed. Love's fever ha<l run so high that its Trvers had ceased to flow, and Honora was moistening -her child's parched lips with her brave heart's blood.
