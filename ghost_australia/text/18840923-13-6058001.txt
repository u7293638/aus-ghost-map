THE OHÜROH ASSEMBLY. FIRST DAY.-Monday, Ski. 22.

Work comes to be estimated rather by its visible re ,ults than by ita essential quality Peoplo becomo more anxious for a good display than for a good conscience, and with conse- quences which are sometimes disastrous Anxiety for success is upt to put u perilous strain on truthfulness And if in the con- tinual eddy of temporary change there should appear in any given j car to be de time anti falling off, discouragement too readily degenerates into mdiAerence nnd relaxation of effort. Numbers ngnin ore sometimes extremely deceptive Wo huir at times, for instance, of tho mar- vellous success of some special mission to the intemperate, and if wo vvoro to believe the returns we might imagine that the passion for intoxicating drink lind been finall) quelled amongst the classes which are moat prone to its indulgence, Fifty thousand men have written their nainos down on a piece of paper -more than that, the magistrates m certain polico courts have suddenly lodt their occu- pation Society is regenerated A month or two afterwards, however, everjtlnng is tis bad as ever, until by renewed efforts the same magical results have been again attanud, only to end once more m the familiar und draus trous failure In time men get used to this kind of thin,?, anti so ut length pay no more heed to the brass binds, and torch light piocessions, and apuits of enthusiasm, and long lists of con verts, than if they were the signs of some recurrent disease through which men had to pass in the natural couise of things, as children pass tluough the mea- cs (Laughter.) For such reasons as these 1 con feas that tablea of returns, when they relate to temporary results, have ver) little tntcrest for me Unless they relate to periods long enough to test healthy und persistent work, 1 look upon them as almost without mean- ing, and expect their publication to do more hnrm than good Tor such reasons as this I have never asked for the tiistotmuy annual reports of numerical mid (inancial progress, and have taken no notice of their disclosures, even when 1 bad approximate knowledge of thur character CHURCH IllOOlltSd Tins jear, howover, a retum has been made-not by my direction-winch tends over ii period Hulhciently largo to mnkc its indications trust« orth) I shall therefore shoitly notice its most significant results.

But lot such persons drive into tho countr), go upon the clearings, talk to tho selectors, and acquaint themselves with the heavy charge pntailetl on small com- munities b) the unhappy divisions among lrotestant hollies, and the) will speedily change their opinion To send a special agent to pick up the gleanings of tho selectors' poverty for tho Bishop of Melbourne's li und would be to court failure-to incur an expenditure which could not possibly Becure nny adequate return What is wanted is more Christian s)mpathy among our town congregations, espe- cially those of Melbourne and ita suburbs there our principal wealth is to be lound lhere, were there true brotherly feeling in men s hearts, it could be given with scarcely .j0sense of self-sacrifice Thore aro two Melbourne parishes whero the organisation i _B ,BlanoP of Melbourne's _ und is a reality And does any one suppose that the inhabi- tants ot those purlshes feel themselves one whit the poorer tor what they contribute ' Let me exhort you, my brethren, in nil brotherly Kindness, to givo ii little more time and cure to this necessary work Let me ask the clergy to take tho initiative; and let me entreat churchwardens and vestrymen to rise above the jealous local leeling which cannot near to see money devoted to any but parochial objecta (Hear, hear ) If in n large, generous, and Christ like affection for ?ur. poorer brethren, we would but make that little effort which is involved in starting and maintaining etlicient parochial organisations, all the immediate wants of the diocese would be speedily supplied, while theveiy eilort would enrich those who made it, with larger measures, not only of spiritual life, but even of pecuniary resources. SUNDAY-SCHOOLS i would .bespeak your special attention to the vv ork of our Sunday school Association, i his is no meie society of energetic men who. taking interest in a particular branch of church work, ore a law unto themselves, but a society called into existence by the Church Assembly, and put under the restraint and direction of laws carefully fashioned by that great representative body. It is the Church's own organ for sustaining and improving one oi the most important branches of her work, we are all. therefore, bound to give it our Jntnest and enernetio support The claim of tau society does not, however, rest solely on the nature of Its constitution. It baa done B00 u *ni* ."'naming work, and it only ?waits the possession of increased means to exit ntl its wholesome influence to every lunn of Sunday school effort and to every parish in the diocese Very few ure uware of the great and urgent needs of oui Sunday schools.

Maps, black bonrds, and illustrated lessons formfants are cutlet entile!)' wanting, or very insufficiently supplied My recent inspection of some of the Melbourne Sunday schools has convinced me that in large buildings classes cannot be elli ciently taught without curtains supported on rods to separate the classes. (Ueai, hem ) How can volatile childi cn attend, whin with one glance of thu eye they can take ni nil the tcmpoiary causes ot disturbance in the whole building, and »hen the observations of their own mstructcr ure well nigh drovvnel by those of neighbouring loud voiced teachers In large schools curtains are an absolute necessity, and even in churches (when, unhappily, classes have to be held in churches) curtain rods might easily be alhxcd to detached utanda, which could bo removed on the dismissal of the school But how are poor parishes to provide such requisites or how is the Sunday school Association to give them aid while its annual income amounts to no more than £80? The association requires, ut the present time, in order to enable it to give that stimulus to Sunday school work which is needed, at least ¿.DOO u year What might not bo done if our association could offer to supply half the expense of books and appa latus to all poor schools in the country, if it had the power of paying a clerical inspector of our bunda) schools, und if it could extend its examination and prize organisations s > as to make their stimulus felt in every parish of the diocese? I iiyincn do not easily realise thu immense importance oi Sunday school work , they fail to see that it has become almost as nectssary n part of church organisa lion as the regular Sunday services and that ni a colon) vv Inch b imshes the Bible from its ila) schools the olu makeshift ways and slovenly methods of teaching aro nothing better than a blind for neglect of dutv (Cheers.) We need an immediate and de terminée! tflort to inciense the resouicea ot the Sunday school Association 1 he question ol the inspection of our Sunday schools has been rcterred to the rural deaneries of Melbourne and the reports which I have received irom the ruial deans disclose a great varict) of sentiment on this subject amongst the clerg) Some recognise the great value of inspection, and ure read) to welcome it Others fear that it might not be acceptable to the teachers or that it might be too inquisitorial or that the examiner might not respect justifiable susceptibilities t r that the method of appointing inspectors might be unsatisfactory I gather, howevei, from the repuita that, it we had the means ot pi) hil, ti clerical inspector, to be appointed bv the bishop nearly all

questions have arisen dunn" the pust)eai at some oí these meet ni"s-among them ihe query ho v fal we tun provide Sunda) instruction for the children ot tho wealthier classes The practical answer to this question involves giavc ililli culttcs, which it would be of little use hue to specify 1 et mc simply say that 1 onl) know two methods which arc likeIv tu be success ful Hie children our wealthier people niulit be gathered into a Sunday class to 1 c lull ni some private house mid taught by some well educated Christian man or vvomim Hie multiplication of such dusses might per haps be nuended by one great indirect ndvan tage It might induce some of our bcttei cdticitcd )oung people who now, alua ' givi but little ot then tuite to Christian work to pinclise that self Icmal lor Christs sake, which would do so much to hallow and ele vate then own character Better still how ever 1 think it would be if all tin chtl Iren of a p irish rich anti poor togetner, were usseiii ble 1 frequontl) m church on a Sunday alter noon to be utcchistd bj the eli rg) man Sh mid it be lound difficult for one person to command attention in our larger town parishes, I would suggest that a series of curtains on moveable stands should be set along the middle i f the church and that while the clergyman catechised tho children on one side ot the screen some highly etlu cated Christum lay in in might do the same office for those on the other side of it li) alternating the sections on successive Sun dil)», the clergjmaii could thus bring all the children of his parish within the reach of his own influence There is a very venerable pre cèdent for this method of teaching Some 300 years ago the saintly Charles Borromeo Archbishop of Milan, finding his diocese in a lamentable state of vice and ignorance instituted what may be called the first Sun day schools in his magnificent cathedral These schools still exist and their modui opitamh is described au follows by one who saw them nt work -' Hie south aisle of the cathedral, ita north aisle, and its south trun sept wcro curtained off In the first a large number of boys were being taught, in the second an immense crowd of women and girls, and m the third quite 100 men of all classes and ages from the lad of 16 to the white haired veteran The teachers some times sat m the midst of large circles ot listeners-sometimes used a movable pulpit If one may curtain oil «puces without loss of dignity in the vast marble minster of Lom bard), Mere can surely be no objection to rescuing to a mindai device in the humble parish churches ot Melbourne (Hear, near ) CONHHMATIOY I rejoice to know that the importance of the ute ot conlirination is being increasingly felt in this diocese I think however, that the liitunute relation between that rita and our bunda)- school system is not very gener ulli u cognise 1 It the teachers especial!) those in out higher classes, would moie con sciously and avowedly direct their lessons to the preparation of their scholars for confirm ntion they would lind this an admirable mellis not t ni) of securing attention and promoting solemnity ot thought and demean oui but also of securing the attachment t f their scholars to the school at the age when they are particularly tempted to iriegulurtt) or desertion, anti then how admirable an opportunity is furnished to tlio clerg) mun at the season of conlirination for sccuruiir edi clent Sunday school teachers 1 hen he gathers Ins young people into classes gives them systematic instruction seeks to deepen then devotional feeling and to prep ire them in t very way for that important onsis when thev make a public prolessi n of their faith in Christ. At what time, then, mu) he more reasonably hope to arouse in the more gifted of the candidates a desire to do work for dod ' Complaints ure sometimes made that too many ol those vv ho have been recentlv con linnet! become irregular in their attendance at church, und dually drift awuj into religious carelessness But why is this Mainly I believe because work of some lind is not provided for those of more active tempera ment Nothing so Ilxes nnd deepens our resolves nothing so effectually turns pro mise into performance, as generous und Bclf den) ing labour While, then )ou keep up youi evening institutes nnd cjmmunicants classes for the mass of j nr conllrniees let me urge jou, my clerical brethren to en dcavour to convert into Sunday school teachers all of them who show special fitness for this ofhec CHURCH MISSIOVS One word I would say on the present post tion of out missions to the Chiiu se and abo rigines 1 or some time past these missions have íeceived aver) inadequate measure ot public attention mid support. Peoplo havo the lmpiession that us the aborigines aro rapidly dying out, it is no longer a duty to contnbute to their support and instruction 1 his is a great mistake, ns a single glance at the report ot the church missions m \ ictoria will convince )ou But whntever view people mu) take respecting the wants of the nbon giucs ot the need of more active efforts for the ovan"clisation of the Chinese there can only be one opinion The Chinese in our mitist are the representatives ot the most numerous family of the human race None of them or very few of ti em, remain willingly to die amongst us It is their aim to return to their native land to enjoy the truits of their Victorian labours Now, if those going homo were in all or inmost cases well malmeted and well established Christians, they might do more to evangelise China than nil the 1 uropenn missionaries at present lal otinng m that countr) (Ap pi luse ) Why is it then, that this great opportunity is being allowed to slip bv unimproved or ut least very in ndeqnutely improved1» Main!), I believo because we cunnot afford to emplo) a 1 uro pean superintendent of our Chinese missions, who can speak fluently to both Chinese and 1 uiopeans. At present no one can thoroughly understand the reporla of the Chinese missionaries, nnd. worse still, no one can test the real character of their labours by direct communication with those who profess to be converts. Again our difllculty is a money difficulty Were wealthy men more generous, more heartily Christian, more capable ot perceiving the true relative value of the different objecta of their expenditure, our difficulties here, as else where, might vanish in a day I wish to judge no man, knowing how much I stand in need of . lenient judgment myself, but I cannot refrain from saying tlmt if some of our people compared tbo sums spent bv them m promoting the kingdom of God, with those wasted on race meetings and amuse- ments, they could hardly feel that they were acting us stewards of God in the distribution of their wealth. (Applause.) If the clergy were more willing to make collections on Mission Sunday on behalf of our home mis- sions to the heathen, the lack of private liberality would be less severely felt PRIMARY EDUCATION. The issue of the report of the Education Commission since wu last met demands some slight notice We neem to have got beyond that depressing time u hen it was necessary to convince Christian men that no morality could be secure or effective which was not based upon religion Professor Seeley does not even claim to be an orthodox, believer, but in his late work on the "Expansion of England," he says, "I always hold that re ligion is the great state-building principle These colonies (the American) could create a new state because they were already a church, since the church (so I hold) is the soul of the state. Where there is a church, a state grows up in time, but if you find a state which is not in some sense a church, you find a state which is not long for this world " (Cheers.) And why not long for thus world '' Because it has no motive at the centre of its life strong enough to be the basis of abiding righteous ness, strong enough to resist the disinte- grating forces of idleness, sensuality, cove tousness, and heartless egotism Of course to atheists and materialists, whose loftiest idea of man is that he is a lump of organic matter on its way to disorganisation, and of morality, that it is an attempt to make this course of change as pleasant as possible, all reference to an Eternal Father, and to the morality which is built upon the perception of our filial relation to Him, must seem vain and foolish But then, thank God, atheistic materialists are an insignificant minority amongst us (Cheers) And nothing so filled mu with amazement when I first came to th s colony us to see men calling themselves Christian allowing themselves to be made, on one flimsy pretext or another, the tools of an atheistic propaganda. (Applause), Surelv they must know that their Master's morality depends wholly on the affirmation that in Him God is the Father of all mankind Suppress that truth, and Christian morality is destroyed How enn 1 love my neighbour as my brother, it we have nu common Father, and if there be no spiritual family, of winch we all are members? You mav trifle and conjure with m ords au you please, but if you suppress in our suite schools the truth that bud is in Christ the 1 ather of the whole human race, j ou maka them at a blow uu Christian, nnd so tar as the truining of the chaiactei is con- cerned all but useless.

Ot this number 11 -b3 resided in Melbourne, leaviug only 10,030 for ali tho other towns und townships of the colony No fewer than 142 of tho boards reported that there was no religious instruction in their district I will not say that a very de. termined effort might not improve this reBult, but I am sure that no voluntary effort could improve it greatly. The number of lay- men able and willing to give religious instruc- tion on week days ib much smaller than any one imagines. We are bo busy a people, and there are so few hands to do the necessary work of our lives, that we cannot hope to find a large class in our midit with leisure and culturo for such a work for man) )cars to come In the country bucIi a class is ab- solutely non einteilt. It has been suggested that the religious bodies might combine, ahd raise a fund for the payment of religious teachers. Such ii écheme would involve an outlay winch is utterly be) omi the means of these bodies, if even the mitiul dilhculties of combination and administration had been overcome. I am entirely in favour of push- ing on the voluntary movement to the utmost of our power. I think that it we fail to do so, Government may fairly question the sincerity with which we object to purely secular instruction But theie is nothing of which 1 am more certain than of this Thnt our utmost efforts, unless supple- mented by those of the wliolo body of state school teachers, will be inadequate to the task which we are attempting If, however, we are to obtain the aid of the state school teachers, there must be Bome moditlcation of the act, and if uny be marte, the question naturally arises, how far shall it go ' I think it would bo of very little use to permit state school teachers to volunteer to add to their labours without any corresponding remunera tion. Tiley have often been kind enough to keep order by their presence.

It is only m the last of these recommenda- tions that I should propo e a slight alteration Instead of moiely permitting teachers to give religiouB instruction, 1 would requuo all to give it who did not allege a conscientious ob jection Untier the former condition it mun might refuse to teach simply because he did not care to take the trouble to do so, wlnle under the latter he could onl) claim cxemp turn on the ground that he did not believe what he was asked to teach The supply of substitutes for the latter class of objectors would not be, 1 believe, bc)ond the power ot the religious denoininitiuns Kemember, my mends, that the ucommendations above specihed have been adopted uiiiuiunousl) by a commission of representative la)men, ol different chuiehes anti ver) various opinions, after an exhaustive inquir) into the whole subject Are vv e to sa) that the trouble and expense ot the commission have been utteil) wasted, and that the onl) use of thou riport is to furnish material tor lighting lires' If not, then some action should be taken upon it Government should be pressed to give effect io its lccoinmenda tions, and Cluistian men especiall) should bestir themsclv e3 to obtain a distinct exprès »Ifji of public opinion upon the subject Thu true fneilds of the Kdueation Act ot Victoria are not those who light blindly for thereten tion ot ita one pernicious piovision, but those rather who endeavoui to insure its per niunency by removing ita delects (Ap plause ) SALVATION AH1U I must say to )0u a le« words about a spiritual organisation winch is working vigorously m our midst, und which, by the tremendous power ot its enthusiasm, is sure to allect all our woik lor gootl or ill The Salvation Ann) has, I think, a special mission Ita avowed object is a very large one-to make every man love Cod Practically, however, its labour is con lined almost exclusively to the lowest classes in our cities and places of considerable popu- lation All its methods of appeal are shaped with a view to reaching those classes, win- ning their interests, una bringing thein into the kingdom ol dod I cannot believe that its religious paton!, its military ritualism, its noise, and tliscouccituig familiarity eau ever be made tolerable to men ol thought, culture, and largely developed religious reveience It 1 had to judge this movement b) its adapta turn to any classes but to those who ure lowest in culture und intelligence, I should pronounce ita huge mistake, and say it was destined to disastrous lailure But I do not judge it thus. 1 look upon it as an eil ort to I win classes which tile Christian churches liuve not won And so considered, it must bo judged very differently, its means must be estimated with reference to the object which the) aie intended to attain And now I mut>t say of the Salvation Army, ill the lirst place, that I believe it to bo inspired by the noblest impulse which can direct human energies-by the desire to make sinful men love and follow Christ. (Applause ) 1 see in its leading ministers and agents a holy sell denying enthusiasm, which, on the large scale, is nowhere equalled at the present time When 1 read ot the bold assaults which they make on the very strongholds of vice in this city—of delicate women risking insult and braving disease that they may rescue their fallen sisters from the grasp of loathsome vice and reckless violence—I feel my heait go out to them m love and admira tion (Applause.)

The firmness and lulness with which it insists upon holiness of heart and lite ure most cheering Autiuoinianism as a doctrine is, I should say, impossible in the Salvation Arm). It is refreshing to see with what trenchant common sense Mr. Booth de- molishes the idea that a man can be living a twofold life-the one pertectly holy, and the other utterly ffeshl) It was also somewhat of a surprise to me lind that this authorita- tive boole repudiates the doctrine of sinless perlection It is true that we still find in it the claim of " entire stiuctilication,' not only as un aim, but as a realised fact. But when we cjmo to ask what is meant by ''entire Bauctilication," we lind a meaning attached to tho words which is different from that which the) natuiully come) It is a kind of sanctihcalion, we arc told, which admits of growth, and which answers to the pulling up ol weeds m a gulden, m order that the more prohtable jilunts therein may make better and moielruitiulgrowth Theieis.ofcourse,agreat deal of contusion in this repiesentation The gieat weed is bcllisliuess-the good plant is love Selfishness cannot be entirely plucked up while love is yet imperfect, lortlie only thing which hinders the perlection of love is thu picsence ot aellishnesa We must be prepared, however, in a popular movement like this for some confusion of thought anti expression If the A ran/ Manual would only adopt some leas misleading words than " entire sauctihcuiion " to describe its mean ing, there woultl be little to quarrel with upon this point But I fear the kind of people tor vv boin tne book is written will not easily distinguish between the " sinless per- fection,' which it condemns and the " entire sanctilication ' which it affirms. 'Ulereare again some excellent practical directions in the book for the conduct ot mission services umongat the poor What can be better than the reminder that " anything will be pardoned by the mob rather than dulness ' ' Or what butter directions could be given lor the uvoitlence of dulness than such as these - " Short, sharp speaking, full of facts and il- lustrations " "Plenty of lively, sharp singing to plaintive or merry tunes-song tunes for preierence." " Plent) of music Music al wa) s means lifo and interest, and never loses its charm " " Never practise nor allow tomfooler) ' Might not someof ourrubnewor slnppers study with advantage such directions as these when la) ing their plans to get hold of the less educated classes ? (Continued ap- plause ) Nothing, to my mind, can be better than our ordinary services, judicially shortened and varied, for people of education and reverent character. But these services are entirely out of place when an effort is made to get at the rougher dusses of our alienated home heathen. (Hear, hear ) Use the church's services at the times appointed for thom, by all means. But what is to pre- vent any of us from having short, sharp speaking, lively singing, and plenty of music ut mission services, out ot the ordinary hours. (Cheers) There ia full liberty of prophes)ing for the clergy, full liberty of singing for the people, and ii any one should think lumselt restricted as to prayeis by the clergyman's promise that "in public prayer and administration ot the sac- raments he will use the form m the said book prescribed, and none other, except so far as Bhall be ordered by lawful authority," I shall be glad to authorise suitable prayers to be said out of canonical hours, as far as I may. Of course, there is much in this book of the Salvation Army of which no English churchman can approve. There is a great deal of nairow asceticism. There is a cop. tempt for the results of honest and reverent thought which ia nothing less than amazing Unless I had read it, I would not have be- lieved that an intelligent man conloi bare ad vised his officers never to read the news- papers or an v thing connected with secular and religious literature, but to confine them themselves to the study of the Bible, the Salvation Iljmn Book, the general orders of the nrmy, und the Ha» Ciy (Continued laughter) Again, what can nnjone ei peuonce but sorrow and lecoil ut such suggestions us the following, in re- spect to bills and poster. After the recommendation of glaring colours, and so forth, it is suggested "they can bo carried about on an umbrella, on a man's hat, round his person like a church bell, with his head out at the top and his feet at the bottom (laughter)-or in ten thousand different lorms " And then, after these precious sug gestions, it ia added, to stir tho imagination und stimulate ingenuicj, "Invent for j our- selves " (Laughter ) Could the man who wrote those words have had in his mind his own excellent rule, '"I here must lie nothing which would not bein perfect harmony with the feelings of Jesus Christ, if He were present with jou m the llesh " Can anyone imagine Jesus Christ sending his apostles through Jerusalem so bedizened, or tolerating; the kind of testimonies and the scenes ot uproar which are permitted, and even en- couraged, at many meetings of the armj » -hut. is just what repels mc I can make great allowances when I remember tho mental inertness, the rude vulgarity, the gross animalism of the classes principally addressed But I cannot believe that much which is done at army meetings in "in agreement with the feelings of Jesus Christ, and 1 grieve to see noble men and women, whom I love and admire for their work's sake, condescending to such unworthy vulgarities for any cause whatever I fear tuut instead of lilting what they call "the mob" to Jesus Christ's level, they will in time let the mob pull them down to its own One thing moro I must say bus astonished and painod me in the doctrine of the Salva tion Army-the manner in which it deals with the sacraments 01 the Christian Church bennty enough surely is the ritual which our Lord appbinted, and how those whose pro- ceedings ure thr /ughout so ritualistic can treat their Master's appointment in this par- ticular with such contemptuous disregard I um unable to conceive The ques- tion is asked in the manual, " Docs the army conaid.r baptism as a duty which must be performed ' " And the answer is, " Decidedly not" But who wns it then who a lid, " Go into all the world and make disciples of all initions, baptising them into tile name of tue lather, and of the bon, and of the liol) Ghost, and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com- manded jou'" Jesus Christ says, make mi n disciples by baptising and by teaching J he army sajs teaching is enough, bap- tising is not ticcessurj '1 he quibbling inter- pretations by which tile manual seeks to evade this dilemma show, I feur, something worse thuu ignorance 'I lie question is asked, " Was not baptism by water quite a common rite among the early Christians '' ' And the almost incredible îeply is given, " Yes , and so was circumcision, shaving the head, washing the ieet ol the saints, and many other Jewish ceremonies " Surely the thought must lune suggested itselt to the composer of this outrageous sentence-" Did Jesus Christ command His Apostles to mako disciples of all men by circumcising them or shaving their heads ?" Nay, were not the Gentiles iorbidden to practise circumcision by the samu Apostle, who declares "all we, who were baptised into Jesus Christ were baptised into His death, und ugaiii " us many of jou as wero baptised into blirist did put on Christ ' ' Such disingenuous trifling is simply amazing Lven worse, and more inexcusable is the slipshod sentence vi Inch unswers the question, " What is the teaching of the army on the subject of the Lord's supper ?' "When such un ordinance," replies this astounding teacher, " is helpful to the faith of our soldiers we recommend its udoption " bo that evcrjonc is to judge for himself whether he will obej the Lord's plain commund, " Do this in lemembrunce of Me, ' and also whether he will seek that great _ ,t which is covered bj the words " 'lins is Alj body ,this is Aly blood " How could u man like Mr Booth, one naturally exclaims, give utterance to such foolish and pernicious dnections iib these We may be quite sure that mistakes of such gravity denote Borne great oversight, some lamentable omission of essential truth And that I believe is the fact in the present case lu answering the question, "What did our baviour do lor us' the At my Manual replies-(1 ) He made known his fathers will (2) He set lurtha perlect example lor our meditation (3 ) ile mude an atonement for our sins bj Ins death 'lhus Jesus Christ's connexion with us would seem to cease with Ins death Not one word is sind about that vital union with Christ which lollows belief, or about our continual communion in his lite, and all which lollows from this The Divine life ma mau h soul seems to be conceived of us an in- dependent gift ol God It is not once hinted that the Holy Spirit only gives to us what Christ has gullied and stored up for us m his ne* humumtj And jet theNew'lestument, and especially the hpistles of St Paul, me full of this A man is a Christian because he is "in Christ, ' because he is related to Him us the brunch to the vine, or as the member of a body to the head, so that, except a mun ' cat tile llesh of Ch-ist and drink his blood," he bus no life in lum. This essential truth, the Armu Manual drops out of its system, a circumstance all the more remarkable because it bus so close a connexion and alhnity with unother truth on which tile Manual delights to eiputiate the personal sanctilicution of the believer. The result is twofold-(1) a mechanical doctrine of the Ati nemeu t, and (2) a mc chanical, or at least unexplained doctrine of the Holy Spirit I believe that all the Army's offensively materialistic talk about " blood and lire" is caused by this fatal omission No one, of course, can deny that St Paul continually speaks of Christ's death us a sacrifice for the bins of the world. But m what sense' Does any spnitual Christian believe that there was Borne magical charm in the mere bodily accident of Christ's death, or that m any literal sense Christ's blood will be sprinkled on his conscience ? It not, then it may be asked whj so much Btress is laid m Scripture on the blood and death of Christ f First, because it wus by His deatli that Christ completed that sacrifice of Hia own will to God's, which was required in the representative of sinful humanity, and, secondly, because He could only prepare for us thut new lile which He came to bestow by passing through death Before our whole humanity can be effectively sanctified, the life of Jesus, consecrated for us in His own person, must pass really, however mystically, into the several individuals who compose the race Now, Christ's death was simply the most critical and decisive step towards that consummation That step taken, all the rest must surely follow. From death He would pass to hie aguin through the resurrec tion , alter the resurrection, He would go from earth to heaven , that, becoming wholly "inspirited," He might shed forth the glorious gilt of Pentecost Luch of these great events was a decisive step in the grand procession by which the Christ without passed on to become the Christ within- bj which the Babe of Bethlehem passed on through the streets ot Nurareth, and the ways of Culdee, and tim courts of the Temple, and the Garden of Agony, and the pains of death, and the kingdom of the shades, and the golden streets of u recovered l'uiudise, into the destined sanctuarj ot the human ami to purge it and sanctity it for God (Applause ) Lach of these was a step , but the critical, the decisive step, that winch ended the period of trial, and insured all the rest, was the aw lui ble sed death on Calvarj Just, then as the maitj r s death is said to buj all tho pol'ttcal und religious results thcreoi, so is the death, the cross, the blood ot Jesus declured to be the means of our re demption and utoneim nt with God on the one side, and of our sanctification on the other -sou, that is what the Army has never seen And hence its vague, aimless and sometimes irreverent talk about blood and its ellicacy Hence, too, its prevailing idea that the office ot Chust is conlincd to the giving of pardon, and that after conversion the soul is committed to the nnnistiy of the Holy Spirit, considered as an independent source of grace Hence the loss of that ieehng (the deepest and most fruitful of any in the Apostolic church) that at every instant the soul ism living union with the living Redeemer , and that it is in linn and from Him that tho Spirit ministers to us the gifts und graces ot the new lite And hence, also, tint disduintul depreciation winch we deplore of the signs ot all this in the sacra- ments appointed by our Lord to be ot per- petual and universal observance Like two great pillars set at the entrance of the Div ine Temple of Truth, stand the two Christian sacraments in the New Testament, and upon them severally are these two inscriptions, "The life of God begins by union with Christ," nnd "the life of God continue s mid grows by main- taining our union with Christ" (Applause ) If, then, the fuct itselt ot this vital union be iguorcd, vv hut wonder that the signs and means ol it are depreciated ? You will see that I have here marked a grave deficiency in the doctrinal system of the Salvation Army. It is right for our own warning und instruc- tion thut wu should note it Other- wise we might suffer our people to fall into views which mutilate the fair system of Christian truth, and into ways winch may lend to the perilous neglect of plain Christian duties. But do not think that I have made these observations in the spirit of antago- nism Very readily do I admit that it would be difficult to lind a Christian church which is not obnoxious to criticism ; and even more readily that our own comparative coldness, formality, and want of elasticity are shamed by the enthusiasm and practical resource oí the Salvation Army. (Cheers.) The men of it I must needs love for their love of Christ, and for their valiant and devoted self-sacri- fice. Not the len, however, yea, rather all the mote, to it necessary to notice any capital defects In a new system ; for nothing Is more common or more dangerous than to let the äoodness of a man cover the defects of his octrine. I am not even without hope, so evident is the honest intention, so marked ia the good sense of the compiler or com- pilers of the Army 'Manual, that some of the errors which I have pointed out may be amended, and a grand effort of Christian love be made all the grander and more powerful, all the more secure und moro useful, by conforming more closely to the -dud of Christ PURITY. I have been credited by some with making a suggestion, founded on my own large ob- servation of the physical characteristics of our northern territory, which may not be without its influence on our material pros- perity I will now make another, which goes, I believe very much nearer to the secret of our national and individual well being It is that every true friend of Australia shall bend his utmost energies, in this formative period of our history, to the maintenance of social purity The life of the nation depends on the life of the home, and that of the home depends on the purity of the individual. The world is full of signs that the struggle for purity is to be the great struggle of our age Have any of you been driven by the sense of duty to read one or more of the terribly realistic sketches of the most famous of modern French story tellers ? It you have, perhaps you have thrown them down after reading a dozen pages, in impatient disgust. I do not wonder if it were so. Sometimes, however, one is not permitted to yield to the first righteous instinct And, knowing as I do, that one at least ot those stories is the simple exhibition of facts in Parisian life, laboriously collected and thoroughly re liable, I overcame my disgust, and read to the end that book is the real record of French decadence I do not wish to make too much of it I know that there are pure populations in French villages, and I would lam hope that the future of a noble race is not to be determined by the life of its cities But should that hope be vain, then I feel that I know the end of the French nation as certainly as if I had seen it arrive—in blood shed, poverty, and shame. It is not, how ever, in Paris alone that the fleshly school is lifting its brazen face, and inviting men in the outraged name of nature to de- vote all the energies of their spiritual being to the indulgence of animal passion, and the glorification of carnal luxury There is u fleshly school of poetry and art in England , and many, alas ! of the so called leaders of society are making themselves (unwittingly it may be) the tools of an æstheticism which has for its heart the heart of a beast (Hear, hear) The apostles of that cult have visited our own land, and taking advantage of the temptations of a life, free, bright, prosperous, and lived under an ardent sun, have sought to justify or excuse that amongst us which is our deepest shame. It is our bounden duty to look this evil straight in the face, to tear the mask off its painted features mid to overcome our shame in talking about that which is shameful, lest taking refuge in its foulness, this vile gospel of the flesh should burrow unseen in the hearts of our young people, and only then reveal itself when it is too powerful to be overcome (Hear, hear) Its common subterfuge is that it is calling men to be natural. Let us see, then, if that be so. Man has a body and bodily instincts, like the lower animal. As we see in those animals it is the purpose of the instinctive passions to secure the preservation and con- tinuance of the species. In the lower animals those instincts operate beneficially, because they are followed in blind unconsciousness They come into active exercise only with tho presence of their appointed stimulants With us it is otherwise. Superimposed upon our animal nature is one of higher kind and finer quality, that conscious the of intellect, con science, and will which is the sole preroga tive of man Our higher faculties have their appointed objects—the wonders of, Gods wisdom in nature, the complicated relations of man in society, the great august realities of the supersensible sphere of religion and worship, the history of the wonderful past, the prevision ot the more wonderful future. When our higher faculties go forth to their proper objects, and find a worthy exercise in their predestined sphere the instinctive passions are left untormented to perform their beneficent purpose in man as in the lower creatures. It is possible, however in an unbelieving materialistic age so to discredit some of the loftiest objects of human thought, and be to neglect others, as to draw down all the glorious powers of our human nature into the low province of sense, and to bid them find their only exercise in connexion with the pleasures and interests which meet them there. What, then, follows ? That the whole force of man a conscious life, of his far reaching intellect, of his potently creative imagination, of his masterful will, and of tho culture which comes from memory and association, are exerted to enlarge, in tensily, and diversify the pleasures which belong to his lowly instincts. But these poor impulses were never designed to bear such a strain. They and their purposes are essen- tially simple. So pressed and strained beyond their capacity, they are driven into irritation and monstrosity. They become the fruitful source of bodily disease, mental dis quiet, and emotional torment. They drag own the loftiest faculties of the soul into the mire of their unnatural debasement. And at length by this horrible process, man, made in the image of God, is reduced to the image of a beast possessed by the soul of a fiend a creature without sense of duty, thought of God, power of self control, or capacity for self denial (Applause) Then the individual and national ruin is consummated then it a pestilence like the cholera makes its up pearance, it finds a nation of cowards whose only thought is to escape the natural death, which is their uttermost idea of evil. Then tho attack of a horde of savages, once no more to them than that of so many wild beasts, becomes a terror and a danger. No man will suffer for his fellow —no man will run risks for his fellow Society is ground down into a collection of selfish, non-coher ing atoms, and, resolved thus into its ele ments, perishes. It is useless to deny that this young society of ours is threatened with such disaster, for the elements of danger lie all around us, and on the very surface of our life. Immigrants bring them from Europe, criminals bring them from New Cale- donia, literature brings them some times openly displayed, sometimes subtly hidden in stories, reviews, and even philosophies. And these fruitful germs of evil fall on no uncongenial soil. They find in a city like Melbourne a rampant larri- kinism, impudent, irreligious, idle, self indulgent, capable of forms of brutal vice and crime which make the blood run cold ; they find a system of prostitution so hideous that its facts have to be hidden away from decent eyes in Parliamentary blue books ; they find, too I fear, in some quarters prac- tices of immorality which, if less infamous, are scarcely less pernicious than these, the existence of which no one affects to doubt but those whose interest it is to conceal them. What, then, are we to do in this strait? I answer at once—organise resistance to the evil. It is not enough that we indivi- dually hate and avoid it. If we are to resist it effectually, to drive it back, and to deliver our children and the future race of this great and glorious country from ruin, we must create a public opinion which will not tolerate it—which will smite with the whip of public shame and reprobation any man, no matter how rich or great, who lends to it his countenance or the support of his example (Cheers ) Law can do something for us by prohibiting and punish- ing the vilest forms of the evil. But law can never grapple effectually with a spiritual influence. Thoughts are things of too subtle a mould to be grasped by the hand of a police man. Impurity is a thing too secret and intangible to be set at the bar of a court. You may have a city as gay, as brilliant, as orderly as Paris, and have at the same time (as Pere Hyacinthe says is the case now) 150,000 harlots in its houses. A spiritual force like this must be met and encountered by a spiritual antagonist—one which knows and seeks its enemy, which meets him at every point of social life, and will tolerate his presence nowhere. It is this conviction which has led to the formation of a white cross union in our church. We refused to adopt any badge, thinking that on such a subject as this, at least, our efforts must be as silent and unob- trusive as they are real and efficient. We refused to call ourselves an army, dreading the intrusion of that military slang, and of those mock military titles which sooner or later make the best movements grotesque. We have a definite object—to resist the growth of impurity—and we adopt a definite means nf resisting it, tho power of the cross of Christ. These things we have indicated in our white cross, and beyond that in the way of symbolism we do not intend to go. The society hopes to gain its members among our young men. While, therefore, urging the clergy to push it forward in their parishes let me give to young men a few reasons for enrolling themselves in its ranks. The best it should be the all sufficient reason—is fur- nished by the natural relation which God has established between the man and the women. Man is the stronger creature—stronger in his physical development, stronger in his intel- lectual grasp, and stronger, far stronger, in his force of will. Now, why has God made this inequality of the sexes a natural ordinance? We know that in many species of the lower creatures the female is the stronger and more formidable animal. Why, then, was it not so ordered in the human species ? It is rash to attempt to specify final causes, but we can not go wrong, in looking for an answer to such a question, in the direction of the faculties which are peculiar to the human race. Man alone among earthly creatures has a moral consciousness, and it is upon obedience to the imperative dictates of this consciousness that his worth and happiness mainly depend. What, then is the secret of moral health and greatness? It is the subordination of the selfish to the altruistic impulses. Let a human being forget self in devoted service to what is weaker than self, and he is already on the highroad to moral nobility. For woman, the natural stimulus to such self forgetfulness is furnished by the relation of the mother to the child, for man, by the natural weakness and clinging dependence of the woman. Why is the weaker appointed to bear the pain and helplessness of maternity—why is she for so large a part of her life, especially in civilised communities, absolutely de- pendent on man for subsistence and protection? Why is her nature set to the law of these natural conditions, so that, with out effort or sense of disharmony, she can accept a position of dependence and trustful love, feeling it her greatest joy to give herself to her beloved? That she may be to the man what her child is to her, and that thus our whole wondrous human life may become one great school of virtue. The equality of mere atomism is simply a school ot selfishness, a provocation of strife, an organisation of egotism and discord. Harmony, love, moral development, implies distinction and grada tions of functions and powers. And there- fore is such distinction and gradation made a part of our very nature. We look for a time when sickness, poverty, and misery shall be indefinitely diminished. If, therefore, the altruistic and sympathetic instincts depended on the mere service and relief of suffering, it would seem as if men must become less moral as the race grew happier. But this is as far as possible from being the case. If sickness, destitution, and sorrow were banished from the world to morrow, the helplessness of the child would still call for the self devotion of the mother, the weak- ness of the woman for the chivalrous and knightly devotion of the man. Still, and for ever, the Christian law of unselfish service is the law of the noble life; still, and forever, the cross of self sacrifice is the symbol of a great and gentle nature. Can we say, then, on the warrant of nature, not less than on that of Scripture, that the man is the head of tho woman? Then, it follows that the man is bound to serve the woman, and to use his utmost strength to guard her from scath and wrong (Applause.) Feel tenderly to every woman—the humblest and plainest—feel that it is unworthy of your manhood to abuse her divinely implanted trust in you, and readi- ness to sacrifice herself for you—feel that it is as much the action of a cur and a blackguard to wrong a woman as it would be to oppress a child, and then your manhood will grow, your courage,your self control, your chivalrous gentleness, and it will be with more right than the proud Douglases of old that you will write upon your shield "Tender and true" (Applause.) Who are the strong men, the bold men, the men of such high knightly character that all look to them for leading, and lean on them in danger? They are the pure hearted men, the men who look on women as sacred beings, made sacred by their weakness and trustfulness, and, above all, by their holy functions as priestesses of the home. If man be the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, the natural fount of those holier and tenderer feelings which are too often dulled or dried up in the hard conflicts and selfish interests of his life. That is why it is a liberal education to live with a pure, high minded woman. She elevates a man's motives, stimulates his imagination, purifies his feelings, and adds tenfold to his moral force and influence, whether in tho church or the state (Ap plause ) Woe to him, then, if in his passion- ate selfishness he corrupts his heart, and abuses a weakness which was associated with his life to call out its noblest and most chivalrous impulses. Careful observers of human life have often been surprised at the subtle, wide-reaching degeneration of character which attends sins of impurity. Their influence seems to reach to the distant recesses of the spirit, and to have a power of breaking down and deteriorating every moral impulse, which is like nothing so much as that which is excited by certain subtle poisons upon the bodily tissues. Whence then, it has been asked, does this sin derive its tremendously noxious and far reaching power? I think I have already answered that question. From its intrinsic baseness , from the continually hardening force of selfishness which is required to shut the ears to that voice of woman's suffering, which, as the sin developes its consequences, pleads so mightily to man's natural pity, above all, from the extinction of that divinely appointed stimulus of man's sympathetic impulses which is furnished by the pure relation of husband and wife, of youth and betrothed maiden. Trample on woman, and you trample on your own moral nature. Re spect woman, care for her, work for her, give her knightly shelter and protection from the human beasts who would wring a moment's pleasure from her ruin, and with continually accelerating force, in secret unconscious ways of which we can give no account, you shall find the loftier emotions gaining sway in your heart, and touching your life to finer issues. Believe me, the maintenance of purity in the relations of the sexes is vital to national greatness and prosperity. (Applause ) For in the relation of husband to wife, of parent to child, through long gradations of mutual tenderness and support, each is bound to each and all "with golden chains about the feet of God." Break once those golden links of loving help and service, and all the strong bonds of civilised society will be weakened and loosed ; men will be driven asunder into selfish atomism, and the whole firm structure of the commonwealth fall into ruin (Ap pluuse ) Resolve then, that whatever be the temptations which assail you, you will resist them in the might of Christ, that never by any act or word of yours will you become guilty of the murder of a woman's body and soul, that if you see some conscienceless wretch stealthily weaving the web of seduction round a helpless maiden's feet, you will with all your strength rend it in pieces and take the consequences (Applause) Fight down the ape within you. Trust in the might of Him who is greater than the world. Be vigi- lant—be confident. ' So nigh to glory Is our dust, So nigh is God to man, When duty whispers low, Thou must, The soul replies, I can. " And by way of strengthening this resistance of your individual will, take measures to create a public opinion which shall be a terror to every evil door. Law, as I have said, can do but little, but public opinion can overawe and bridle the mightiest trans- gressors in the world. Organise yourselves, therefore, into a vast white cross union, the members of which shall be pledged to stand together, to seek the life of the King of Purity in Holy Communion and to strike with all their collective force against the dark fiend of social corruption. You not only double your strength, you increase it a myriad fold by association. You gain thus the force of sympathy, the conscious ness that a thousand minds are perfecting your plans. A thousand hands are sustain ing your work, a thousand voices are swell mg your prayers. You will thus create a literature, a propaganda of purity ; above all, a banded might of righteous opinion before which the boldest libertine will shrink and falter (Continued applause) Oh ! whether you be young or old, think, I pray you, of the holy names of sister, wife, and mother, think of all the holy influences which stream forth upon an evil world from the relations which those sacred names represent, and resolve one and all, that under no sky from which the sun shines down, shall those names have a holier, tenderer meaning, than in this fair land of our birth or adoption. Do much and dare much in this blessed cause, resolving that if you cannot conquer at once at least you will do what in you lies to prepare the victory for a coming generation. Remember what the poet has said about that glorious de feat which is the pledge and condition of ultimate victory— ' They outtalked thee hiss'd thee tore thee— Better men fared thus before thee; Fired their ringing shot and passed, Hotly charged and sank at last. Charge once more then and be dumb ! Let the victors when they come, When the forts of folly fall. Find the body by the wall!" THE CLERGY One word to the clergy, and I have done lor a whole gcneiation the ministers of religion have been prosecuting their work under the picsure of crippling disabilities From a past full of mistakes and short comings they inherited a populnr distrust which ¡denuded them with the party of privilege and reaction Again, without any lault ot their own, they lound themselves confronted by a parasitic philosophy, which, winding its poisonous and strang ling arms about the healthy trunk of modern science, craftily identified itself with that which it concealed, and created the pretended conflict between religious and scientific truth Once more, as it these diffi culties were not enough to test then courage and resource, Christian ministers in these southern lands have had to contend with all the disadvantages of division, competition, poverty, exhausting toil, and the thousand privations attendant on the rough and ever changing circumstances of a new settlement Iheir life has been a hard one, and if at times oppressed and weary, battling des perately with adverse ínfluences and de pressed by indifference or contempt, they have felt as though their efforts were hope less, who amongst us is entitled to question their fidelity, or to stand apart and Bay, 1 am holler than thou ' It has been a weary fight for many But take courage my beloved brethren Hie clouds are lifting, the stum bung blocks are being rolled away. He whom we have served in the darkness is visibl) coming out of His place to honour his faith ful servants and to prove to them once again that He is the Lord ot mans heart, and that not one of his words of promise shall fail of its fulfilment Be it ours then to cast away every theory, however venerable, which is more or other than His words will justify, to affirm boldly everything which He baa taught us, however apparently para- doxical or opposed to powerful interesta, to set Him forth fully as th« Friend of the poor, the Saviour of the sinful, the Divine Founder of that Kingdom of God, in which strength is to be the servant of weakness, lovo the destruction of privilege, and the brotherhood of man the crowning glory of the Gospel ot the Fatherhood of God ; and then, sooner, perhnps, than wo have ventured to hope, and in secret marvellous ways past mona finding out, the heart of the woild shall be opened to receive our message, to rejoice with ua in its blessedness, and to cherish it as the truth und the power of God.
