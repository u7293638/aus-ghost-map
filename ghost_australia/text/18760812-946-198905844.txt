The Fakir of Oolu.— Our old friend Dr. Sylvester, the Fakir of Oolu, has recently opened a'ine'w season at St. George's Hall, Melbourne, which promises to be verjJ suc cessful. The hall lids been newly fitted up land decorated, and tho leading attraction is :a sensational melodrama, ' The Hdurited Castle, or- tho Great Wager of ^500,' the special worK or mruarnec vvaicn, tno-weu known literary secretary of tho AthentPum. :The piece- is -altogether one of the' most remarkable that has ever been produced in this part of the world, as the dramatis personct :is made up almost entirely of supernatural 'characters— denizens of that world hitnerto ' confined to tho limits of children's 'story books. The plot' 13 simplicity itself. iMajor Shrapnell, an English otllcer, wagers ?'£500 with some of- his sporting friends that 'he will sleep a night in:; an old ghost- haunted, deserted, and ruined ?ca3tle.- 'Arriving at the castlo, ho lays' -;oufc ihis1 pist'ols ?'?? arid s^yord,? takes leave of' his guide -f roriv thP ; nearest habitation, fully a niiloidway. Ho settles himself down to road: 'one of the' best anecdotes told of Artemus- Ward;1' but gets to tho second '.lino only, when he is interrupted by sundry conscience«3tricken bats, who' flit across tho chambor. ? Finally, after 'several 'futile : n fforriTifd t.n Tnnrl- Ilia- pnndlpa nrn rtvfiti giiished, ;ftnd tho next thing!the audience sees is the flame of the candle floating; about in the 'air. Not the candle, but orily.the flame. Matters ? dro getting ? decidedly ?uncomfortable for the major, when suddenly he is Confronted by the apparition1 of a ?monk, who solemnly abjures the bold' mortal to leave while ho is1 safe. Tho majbr'says he will 'see the ghost of the holy ' friar far enough first, and then tho apparition suddenly changes into a- furious Mephisto ? pheles; whb! makes'sevoral heathenish pro posals and vanishes, after he has beeu- run through by the major's sword. Then came a sprite, in charge of the orthodox chests of gold . ; 'then the ghosts of the' love-sick miudeii and her ;lov.er,'aU o£ whom '.were '.perfectly invulnerable to steel | and! lead. .'Th.01, inajor's hair assumed a perpendicularity ' qdlte'foreigri to its' habit, but, undaunted, 'he sticks. to, his self-imposed task, and, finally his .'ghostly; visitors all pass away, arid tho major wins his wager. The dialogue is well written! : but the. illusions are bpWild'eririg, dazzling, maddening. The .entranced Lady, 1 the.
