(Applause.) He was not sur- prised a», the clapping, as nil present wero henrty .uppottors of tho Association. Ho would, befnro making any remark«, read a note which lind been ?#? handed to him, and which ho believed tho writer had intended should be modo public-it was as follows : " To TUB CHAIRMAN OP THE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY, " GRAFTON. m ' " Grafton, 18th March. " Stn,-Being a warm supporter of the Institution, I wish to call -your attention tOj, the charge of one shilling for entrance, which I believe is detrimental to the best interest of the Association. My viow of the position of the Society is, thaUtho exhibitors should deposit their exhibits, and the public should have free entronco to inspect the same after the Judges' inspection. I regret I cannot at this, your third anni- versary, bo present at your dinner. " I am, Sir, yours truly, I * "J- S.,DnEw." This was quite a novel suggestion, and a new track altogether, OB ho believed it, was customary at all similar exhibitions to charge an admission fee to non members, as if it wero not so, how could tho Asso- ciation be supported, as to admit the general public not subscribers to the Institution-nee, would, in his opinion, be detrimental rather than otherwise. .Though Mr. Drew, who vvns a Biipporter of tho Asso- ciation, ho felt sure was .actuated by the best of motives in submitting his suggestion. True, on the present occasion, they had not been so fortunate with their shillings, as just about the time for admission that day, when largo numbers would have attended, there was a regular down-pour of rain, and thus their takings at the gate had only amounted to about £17, which under moro fav ourable circumstance«, he felt certain would not have been ICBS than £30-(hear, hoar)-though tho officers of the Association were very thankful for the general support of the public, as vi hen the storm abated, ho vi as surprised to see eo largo on attendance 1 he prizes paid over to success- ful competitors amounted to about £10fi-being about £80 short of what was offered b) the Associa- tion for competition Many thinps for which prizes were announced, ought to have boen exhibited, as there v

stock and exhibits that would be satisfactory aliko to the exhibitors as well ns to tho Society, and tivvards which there would b* a balance in hand, and though not so much as £50, ne ho had mentioned

wish to mention, to dis- prove what had boen remarked by one or two that the show was poor and paltry Now he found that tho entries of live stock were no le«s than 213-and in addition to that number twenty-six others competed for special prizes , whilst in the products and manu- facturing classes there were 2^5 entries-making in all nearly SOO exhibits for the judge» to examine lins )car thev had

skill nnd competenc}, and they hod a right to regard thom as honest men In giving their decisions the) might possibl), in some instances, bo mistaken in their judgment, but no exhibitor lind n right to question the decisions, but should ncccpt the same, and still regard the judges ns having been honest and conscientious in their nwnrd (Hear, hear) If an) of the judges thought that by their

connected with its management were knocked up-and there must in future bo a division of labour, and a regular set of officers, as this v\ as not a charitable Institution, but an Association, the establishment of which was for the benefit of tho whola district During tho present year, the committee would have to toko possession of tho land, and devise means for tho fencing in of the ground nnd the erection of sheds, &c-;£100 at least would be required to bo so expended, and then next ) ear tho Association could hold their fourth Exhibition on their own ground, which would bo moro pleasant,

At tho present time ho held two ofHcos-that of President and Treasurer of tho Association-the duties of which offices ought not to go together. Tho President bhould not havo much, to do-their should, ns their worthy soorctary romarked"-bo a greater division of labour. Ho did not think it was the duty of a Presidont to be ongaged running about tacking up cards, though he did not mention this for the sako of grumbling, out ho thought others ought to fall in, and do a share of . tho work. By appointing some one clso to the office of President, it would givo a greater impetus- to the Association, as whether an officer or only a humble member, ho should continuo to do his utmost to advance tho-Association and district. Tho President then alluded to special prizes hnvingbeen given during tho last two years, and hoped that tile example of then-VIce-Prcsident, and Mr.Thomas Small, in follow- ing thiscoursowould induco others to comoforvvaid and offer special prizes, as was tho case in other parts of tho colony. For many exhibits tho prize offered by the Association was not large, but by tho schedule boing supplemented in this woy, many moro might be induced to exhibit. Bcfuru sitting down there was a toast, which should have boen given boforo his, it was that of " The Judges." Ho was quite suro theio ivan no one, who in their hearts felt but that the Judges had dono their duty, midgi von their decisions conciontiously -fair and honest as botween tho Exhibitors themselves nnd between tho Exhibitors und the Association, and ho hoped thoy would not hear any complaints, as if BO, it only relleetod\ipon themselves, as the election of thb^juogos rested with the members of lho Associ ation,-and'.if thoy Jaft\ii tqj'ono or two to do, they ought not to complntifcnltcrivntd«, though ho would prefer to see a larger attendance of members at the meetings when the schedule was being prepared, and and the judges appointed.
