TURF QUOTA TIONS. • Of the immediate future only the Bracelet Race receives attention, their being, at the time our report closed, no business on the Avoca races, which commenced to-day. For the first-named event Mr Wbittingham's nominations seem most in favor. All three horses, Larpent, Nautilus, and Rooftree, are backed, though not sufficiently to select any one as the favorite. Of the others, King's Head, the Ghost, Belladrum, Transferred, and-Rhea are all moderately supported. For the Derby and Cup, the two Allanders and the two Golden Butterflies continue in request. The latter especially is sought after, and a large commission in the market is only partly executed. We quote the following prices:—The Ladies' Trophy—14 to I agst Larpent, 15 to 1 Nautilus, 16 to 1 King's Head, 16 to 1 The Ghost, 18 to 1 Rooftree, 18 to 1 Liberator, 20 to 1 Tumult, 20 to 1 Transferred, 20 to 1 Khea, 20 to 25 to 1 othera.—H erald.
