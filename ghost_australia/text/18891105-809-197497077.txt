THE RACING CARNIVAL. ; THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CUP. One of the sights connected with the great racing festivities which Australians are cele brating this week is tho appearance of the city on tho night beforo the Cup. Though tho faces of many strangers, aud also many straugo faces, are to bo seen in tho metropolis upon Derby day, it is not until the night before the Cup is run that tho city receives its full complement of visi tors. Tho trains arriving yestorday from different parts of tlio country, and tho overland trains nnd intercolonial steamers, were crowded with ardent sightseers, who, liko another vast ormy of Goths, annually take possession of Melbourne, rejoicing tho hearts of hotel and coffee palace proprietors no less than lodging houso keepers. Accommodation, even of the scantiest description, for either man or beast during " Cup "Weok" runs to n famine premium. Tho untravellcd visitor who hns omitted to peg out bis " diggings " some days beforehand often finds himself in tho nwkwnrd predicament of having to put up with a Bhake down upon a billiard table, and bo thankful that he is not asked to try anil snatch a few hours of fitful slumber stretched on an 18-inch pine board balanced upon a couple of chairs. Very many persons from inland towns find tho diffi culties of obtaining moderately comfortable quarters in tlio city so great at this time of tho year that they only pay a llying visit to the metropolis by an early morning train, nnd return again to their comfortable homes at the conclu sion of tlio day's racing. Upon the day beforo the great race visitors concentrate themselves in CollinB-street, which IS t.lu fuahiulmbiu piuliieliuue, lliuugii " the block " lias sadly decayed, having become a moro ghost of the days that are no. more, when the "clmppies" and bright eyed' maidens were accustomed to dawdle away the golden hours every afternoon upon tlio two blocks that wore then dedicated to the rank and fashion of the Aus tralian world. Collins-street yesterday afternoon however, wns as crowded as at any time in its short eventful history. But the great sight in tho city, apart from the Cap day itself, is Eourke-street after nightfall. Thousands upon tliousauds then fiock to Tattersall's Club and to tiie betting rooms, nnd overflow on to tho pave ment in front of the Opera House, and on to tiie roadway, causing an almost total suspension of traffic. These are the en thusiastic patrons of the turf, that largo army of sheep wliioh every year walk with dulcet gentleness into the nico little pens prepared for them by the bookmakers, who ruth lessly fleece them by means of tempting offers to lay 2 to 1 bar 20 for tlio great event. Your average sportsman would no more enjoy attending a rnco meeting without having a nice little double in his betting book, or a score of " straight out wagers, " than lie would relish going to a racecourse without the inovitnblo cigar. It is one naif of his delight to elbow his way through the crowd in Bourke-Btreet, and pick up tho current gossip about what horses are expected to run next day ; what mounts certain jockeys are to have ; what betting hns taken place ; to hear the very latest tittle tattle from the stables ; to discover the man who was present at the last trial gallop of the favorite ; to run to earth the safest of safe tips, so that next day he may go on the course and use it. Here all sorts of " flash " gentry nro to be seen, with- redolent locks and large flashing dia mond rings, eager to "lay a wnger, sir." Most of these mysteriously disappear after the Cup is over. But they turn up again at the same time next year, and make another "little book." "Where do they vanish to ia the interval ? Where do they come from? These are questions not polite to answer, being decidedly personal. Of course it is only tho small fry among bookmakers that plies Its vocation on tho kerbstone. The bookmaker of recognised status handles his pencil in the club rooms, where the' heavy betting is done. Far into the night does tho crowd keep vigil in the street and talk horse. Some of the visitors turn their attention to tho theatres, as offering metal more attractive, and not a few show valor in the bubbling wine cup, over which they become eloquent upon tho past glories of a Fishhook, a Barb or a Grand Flaneur. But all aliko dedicato a restless night to the probable winner of tho Cup, whipccupics their last waking .thoughts, then rides roughshod through their dreams, until in the pale dawn of the eventful day they awake from sleep just as somo delusive vision of a race fades away past an imaginary winning post, and tho happy dreamer of racing dreams rises be times to mako liis final wager upon the colors he saw carried first past tho judge's box. It was unanimously agreed by visitors to Flcmington on Saturday that a more interesting day's racing had never been witnessed on tbe course, but the character of to-day's programme suggests a probability of the enjoyment of sport of an equally ' high order, as tho fiolds in most of the events bid fair to be unusually strong both in quantity and' quality. Tlio Hurdle Race, with which the day's racing will commence at 1 o'clock, 1ms 14 com petitors left in, Cory thus heading the list' with 13 st. The prosenoo of tlio Now South Wales representatives, Drilldool arid Bellringer, will in vest tliis event with an intercolonial significance which must add materially to its interest in tho eyes of tlio public, as oach of the pair lias shown excellent form over the little jumps nt Rnnd- wiek on recent occasions. In Sluggard, South Australia possesses a capable and well tried hurdle . racer ; and although Chandler lias become the property of a Victorian sportsman, Tasmania will, in the event of his victory be justified in olaiming credit for having bred tho winner. There nro no less than 50 candidates for backers to select from in the Railway Hnndicap, of six furlongs, including a largo proportion of well accredited fliers who have lately displayed the possession of pace, nnd the selection of the winner from such a list suggests a problem difficult to solve. The Kensington Stakes will probably bo contested by a good field of 2-year-olds ; and tlio next item in the programme is the Melbourno Cup, in which pnblio interest will bo centred, and" the start for which is to take place at 4 o'clock. Tlio gront spring handicap, gradually growing in importance year after year, has this season assumed colossal proportions, the sweep stake being 50 sovs. each and the money added by the club 5000 sovs., in addition to which the winner will receive a trophy value 150 sovs. The field lias been reduced- to 22, the latest withdrawal being that of Lonsdale, who wus scratched yesterday in consequence, it is understood, of having strained himself in a gal lop. Tlio retirement of Lonsdale is a severe blow to a host of backers, tlio liorso having beeu strongly supported during the lust fortnight. The comparative sinallucss of the field for tho groat event, so far from being a disappointment, is really a matter of congratulation, and this for very obvious reasons. It was at one time feared that a number of horses witli no possible cbauco of winning would bo started in the interests of persons holding them in tho mam moth sweep promoted in Sydney, but as this was not drawn at tho time the second forfeits were due, tho undosjrablo presenoo of such animals lias fortunately beeu averted. The field therefore has become thoroughly select, consistingly solely of horses whose business will be to win if possible, and 'first class animals Xiossessiug a fair chance of appropriating the valuablo prize will, in consequence, run less risk of interference than- their owners and trainers feared might bo tlieir fate, as it was that of Chicago last year. Since the running for the Caulfield Cup specula tion lias been carried on merrily, several horse? having been backed to win very large stakes, notably Signapore, Antreus, Melts, Chicago, Cardigan, Knight of the Gaiter and Bravo. The public have suah sted- fast confidence in Carbine and liis owner that public money at one time made the ft'mous New Zcalander as good a favorite as anything, despite his crushing impost of 10 st., a' weight which lias never been carried to viotiry in a Melbourne Cup siuce tbe famous Artier of old won his second Cup in 1862, carry/ng 10 st. 2 lb. Last Saturday's result) hav however, weakened both Carbine and Shgapore in the market, whilst the phenomonalrnn made by Melos at tho finish of the Melbourne Stakes, has placed him firmly at tho head of the quo tations, and he will probably/ seo the post to-day as red hot a fauirito as ever carried publio confidence in ihe contest for tlio Melbourne Cup. After mo Caulfield Cup meeting Bravo fell lame and great liberties were taken with him by cortain Juyers of odds, who have however since had reason to bitterly regret their temerity, as tlio Ballarat representative camo again with a rattle in the market yesterday, and wns supported in a manner which left little room for- supposing that his condition was at all critical. ' Antaius, who was a firm first favorite lost week, lost many friends by dying away after leading at a great pace for a mile in tho Melbourne Stakes. No 3-year-old could, however, have been expected to main tain sucli a rato of speed from end to end and as it- is not probable that similar tactics will bo pursued in a race liko tlio Melbourne Cup, backers of tbe handsome son of Sir Modrcd need -not consider their hope a forlorn one by any means. Chicago, who was notoriously knocked about most shame fully in tho race last year hns been in strong favor during the last few days, and will doubtless start one of tho warmest favorites, and tho . powerful party behind Knight of tho Garter, notwithstanding his moderato cre dentials on public form declare tlint tiie race is all over but shouting. Bcnzou is another borso with a numerous nnd sanguino body of supporters, whilst Mr. "Whito's gelding Rudolph has gained many friends since he led the field such a dance in the Derby on Saturday. As usual on the eve of the great contest, outside backers on the look out for an investment at long odds wero busily engaged yesterday in endeavor ing to select the best of the " long shots,'! tho most popular choice apparently being BInienose (a 4-year-old brother to tha famous maro Brown and Rose), whose weight ii only 6 st. 10 lb. Correze, who so sadly dis appointed his backers in the Maribyrnong Plate, heads the list for the Nursery Handicap, on level terms with The Admiral, who won that event, the number of competitors being 38, which should ensure a great race over -the straight five furlong course. To-day's racing will conclude with the Yan Yean Stakes, in FLEMINCtON ANTICIPATIONS. By JAVELIN. Hurdle Race.— Cortthus, 1 ; Slcccard, 2. Railway Handicap. — Traveller, 1; Prat >. tlkr, 2.
