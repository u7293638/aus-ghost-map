IN the House of Commons on Fridayy night Sir GEORGE CAMPBELL, on a formal motion, raised the question of conceding to Western Australia re sponsible government, and with it the absolute confciol of a laige temtory The debate which followed was inte resting, inasmuch as the lines upon which it was earned new to the Imperial Pniliauient Hitheito, at any rate so far .is Australia is con cei ned, extent of temtory has haidly been taken into account. As instances of this, a nieie handful of people settled in and about Sydney were fieely invested with at least nominal sovereignty over a vast tract of country extending from the extreme southern, to the extreme not them latitude of Austnha Litei still, a far less numeious community, the headquaiters of which were in Adelaide, was cheerfully endowed with political and commercial contiol ovei that wide section of Austiaha which stretchesunbioken ftom oipe Northern berlaud to Torres Straits. There is little doubt that, only for better infoimation and unimpeachable ma sons to the tcontiary, the great tein tory of West Australia—winch is aibi tranly divided fiom the rest of the continent by a meridian of longitude, a temtory gieatei than that of any othei piovince in the group, and compnsing a very great variety of conditions of climate and soil—vv ould have been made over to the absolute political ovvnei ship of the voiy small, and in many respectsunimpoitint, community which has congregated on the hanks of the Swan Rivet This little community had grown somewhat in size, and also In i ...1.ii0u. Tlicic followeu ilieusuvl demand that it should be emaiicip vted from the leading strings of a Ciowu colony, and authonsed to set up foi~U self as the youngest, but by no means the least important province in tins gieat group of self-governing colonies It was rightly assumed that, to the petition foi locil Government per se there would be little objection from the Impel lal party to the question It was also assumed, piematurely as it seems, that no objection would be taken to investing this little community of 40,000 souls 01 so, most of whom* ai e congregated 1n the south western comer of the nominal colony, with sovereign rights over the whole area which is included between the parallels of 13* and 45 south, md takes in all the Australian continent which lies to the westward of the 129th mendian of east longitude. The terntoiy thus outlined is teisely described as bounded on the east by an imaginary line, on the north and west by the Indun Ocean, and on the south by the South Pacific Ocean. It is about 1300 miles from north to south, 800 miles fiom east to west, and contains an aiea of oyer one million square miles The oiiginal demand of the West Australian colonists was, as we have said, for dominant power over the whole of this vast territory, or, more accurately, they demanded the concession of self government with the obvious under standing that they would, as a matter of couise, be endowed with that power. Yery early in the case, a demuner was entered by some British politicians, who took the very reasonable ground that 640,000,000 acres of country was rather much to devise absolutely to a community of 40,000 people Tins objection being manifestly sound it was pioposed to cut the terutory in two by an imaginary line following a paiallel of latitude, and reserve the northern poition to be dealt with when and how the Imperial Got eminent saw fit The ambitious politicians of Peith objected, mainly, it was suggested, because a vast extent of valuible pastoral coun try in the noithwest would, under such an airangement, be placed out of leach of their speculative enterprise. Now, and before matters have been settled one way oi anothei, theie comes a distinct expiession of opinion from the House of Commons, that responsible Government should be gianted to West Austiaha only undei seveial bioad conditions, chief among which is a icserve, on the part of the Imperial authorities, of the light to define the conditions relating to emi giation, and the mode of dealing with the unoccupied lands of the colony. The leason for this condition is plain enough Whether rightly oi wrongly, it has become a belief with many leading men at home that over popu lation of the Bntish islands is a glowing evil which must be grappled with, and that the only tiue way to re duce it is by a hbeial scheme of erni giation. Suitable aieas for emigiant colonies are already few, and aie be coming fewer. It was pointed out in the Commons debate that self governed colonies, as a rule, discouiage State aided emigration, and are prone to re gard all the land within their holders as an endowment for themselves and then natuial heiis And it was hinted that such would assuiedly be the case in West Australia, that, in fact, the clamor 'oi self government aiises really from a desire to have un limited power of commeicial entei prise over a teintoiy where such entei pnse, if slnewdly conducted, would be enormously profitable. The aigument of Sn Geoige Trevelyan and those who agree with him is, that the pos session of terntoiy which may be utilized foi occupation by the surplus population of Brit un is of high, almost vital necessity to the welfaie of the empne, and that, this being so, any such terutory ought not to be alien ited fiom the Impel ial Ciovvn. The Times, according to a telegiam m yesteiday’s Star, charges Loid Knutsford with having no definite policy as to the disposal of the Impel ial patrimony, and with being piepared to yield to pressure from any quaifcer Peihaps the tiuth is thatLoid Eadtsford does not realise the commercial and political value of the unsettled Australian ter ntoiy, and theiefoie sees no reason agunst allotting it according to the Wish of those who assert a claim to it But it seems likely that the Impeiial Paihament will lefuse to agtee to the Embhngßill pioposed to be In ought in for the puipose of coufening self government on West Australia, unless it includes a proviso leservmg to the Butish Ciovvn all the lands not undei bona fide oixupition iurinn. die nairowing or cue issn» between the Phoenix Foundry Pro pnetaiy and then employes, as nar i ited at length in yesterdiys Star, the belief became general th it this most unfoi tunate complica tion was on the point of being cleated aw ly. The directois of the Foundiy have conceded all the essential points, and, in fact, now express their readi ness to agree to terms almost identical with those which were accepted as fully satisfactoiy by the employes of Messis Hickvvn and Cowley This intelligence conies as a welcome relief to the citizens of Ballarat, and ilso, we presume, to the non.voikers’ assistants and theit families Neither puty had anything to gam by peisist mg in the fight, while both parties to it had much to lose. And then the reputition of B illarat, as well as the reasonable interests of its commercial community, ought to have counted for something, as no doubt they did. The ironwoikers’ assistants moved for a certain minimum day’s wage, and a ceitain scheduled allowance for overtime. Both these points have been conceded The dnec tois undei take to lecogmse the locil ti ides’ union, on condition that any further dispute or guevance be first 10 fei red to the Ballarat Tiadc and Laboui Council, at winch both sides will be en titled to a heai mg We do not see what more they could do in tins way. One of the mistakes made by the non woikers’ assistants was in taking up arms on theii own account, without having fust submitted their griev ance to the council for recognition or otherwise Both sides will be in a sounder position if it be thoroughly undei stood tliat any future difficulty' will be lefeired first of all to the Council of the Ti ides’ Hall Asa fuither concession, the duectors engage to employ heieafter none but union men So fai all is plain sailing, but the duec tors consideied themselves bound to arid ono ot two tliunu Minch aie fiaidly so popular. One is tint they will retain all the non union men at piesent employed, and who vveie, of couiae, taken on when theie seemed little chance of early settlement The other is that the manager in fill ing his vacmeies will make 1m own selection amongst the union men. The first is not so awkward a thing as it looks The w hole mimbei of non unionists employed is 24, vnd most of these ate undeistood to rank as laboiers. But the management plead that they aie under agreement to keep these men employed, and see no sufficient reason foi break ing that agieeraent Well, m a crowd of some hundreds of vvoikmen these 24 may well p.iss muster, but they miy leive of their own accord, or teinunate their engagement by some bieach of agieement, or they may join the union, in either of which cases the difficulty will disappear. The directois hav e conceded a great deal, no doubt with a view r to early settlement, and the men on strike hav e evidently recog nised the spirit in which they have been met by the directors. The struggle has been happily terminated by the unanimous acceptance, on the part of the Ironvvorkeis Assistants’ Union, of the terms offered by the Phoenix Foundry Company. We hear tily congratulate both sides on the satisfactory termination of the dispute, and doubtless the news of the settle ment will be leceived with equal satis faction by the public. The strike at the Phcemx Foundry has now been practically brought to a termination, and work w ill be resumed at the foundry to morrow morning under conditions somewhat similar to those which existed previous to the dispute The terms submitted from the conference between the directors of the Foundry and the Tr ides’ Council concilia tion committee were fully cmsideied vesterdiy at the meetings of the vinous societies interested, «ho were called toge ther for the purpose. A meeting of the executive committee of the Ironworkers’ Assist mts’ Union was held yesterd ly morn mg, vinen it was decided to recommend the gem nil meeting to accept the terms offered A t tlie mectingsof the Moulders, Bofieunak-rs, ina Engineers’ Societies, held in the evening, it was also resolved to strongly recommend the assistants to accept the proposals The latter bodj met at 10 o’clock, and uuaui inou-dy adopted the recommendations from their executive The result was reported by the president of the Assistants Union to the ■trades’ Hill Cjimeil, who congratu I ited the assistants ou their decision, Mr J L Anderson (president of the counc 1) and Mr T. Porter were ap pointed to meet the directors to day and draw up an agreement. On the con elusion of the pioceedings the men assembled in front of the Trades’ Hall gave hearty cheers for the various bodies interested, for the trades’ Council, and the press An ad journment was subsequently nude to Pub joy s Unicorn hotel, where Mr Sheldon, pusident of the Ironworkers’ Assistants’ Union, proposed the health of the president of the Trades’ Hall Council. Mr Anderson suitibly replied Meetings of the various trades will bo held during to day’.
