THE KINGDOM OF GOD. ' The kingdom of God is within you,' saith the Lord. Turn yourself with all your heart to the Lord, and nnfix your iffections from this sinful world, and you shall find rest for your soul. Learn to think little of external things, and to give your thoughts to things internal, and you will find that tho kingdom of God will enter into you. For the kingdom of God is riglietousness, peace, and joy in the' Holy Ghost, and this is not given to the unholy. Christ will come to you, giving you his own consolation, if you prepare him a worthy mansion within. All His glory and honour are from within, and there it pleaseth him to dwell. He who frequently entertains Christ will have sweet discourse with him, comfort and consolation, much peace, a friendship too wonderful for the heart of man. to have conceived. â€” Thomas a Kempis.
