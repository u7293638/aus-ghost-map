DR. PORTER ON GLUTTONY. In- the Petersham Baptist Chinch, on Sunday night, the Rev. Dr. Porter sfioke strongly against the sin of glut tony, which ho avers to lie prevalent. Speaking on the same matter, he said the Apostle Paul had used lan- guage which had been fo misinterpreted as to lend form mul r force to certain injuries misconeeplicns. When Paul said, "There is a sin which is a sin- unto death," he meant the death of the body and not the death of Hie soul. Gluttony was one of the primary varieties of sin unto death in Paul's sense — a common, grievous sin. People paid that long voyages helped them, sea-sickness did them good. That was so— but not. quite in th-» sense intended. Some jiwplc's stomachs never got a rest, except when they were at sen. Their bodies, as Chris tians, were temples of the Iloly Ghost, and he bade them bewaru ol specific bodily rins. Many generally good incn and women did not live out their allotted span of days because they committed the sin unto death by the abuse of their own bodies. Men over-ate, and heennio overheated. Then their tortured bodies rebelled, their brains became blood-congested, and they eolhqised; while other people talked sagely of "flt«." Fits of that kind would be far fewer if people had to live on dumper and mutton. The doctor said nothing relative to ill© counties victims of Australian cookery— which is commonly ex ecrable; but he had a large subject, and some points necessarily passed untouched.
