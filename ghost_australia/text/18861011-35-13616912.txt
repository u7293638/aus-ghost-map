THE MAGAZINES FOR SEPTEMBER FiRST NOTICE. Mr. Walter Besant, in his "Children of Gideon," which continues to be the chief attraction of one-man s Nagannc, is working out the problem of heredity, which he dimly implicated in the earlier chapters of his story He has made the child co of an honest sober woman and a depraved burglar all excellent specimens of society after their several kinds and now he has confronted them with their reprobate father, out on a ticket-of-leave The situation is now and most powerful THIS IS how the father speaks to the son a follow of Trinay, and a barrister - "'look vo, Clivudo,' he said, with a full, round, and sonorous oath, ' you may keep your trade to yourself if you please, you're afraid of mv getting a hand in it I suppose But you won't keep your old father out of your rooms I shall come here for company and for drink-I shall come here will never choose It's rather lonely where I've put in pith and they're a low lot about mm, compared with the old pills, and there, not many of the new men that I came to know AA h there was a n on last night pretended I never to have heard of the great Jim Carey The profession has gone down it's gone very low indeed Any man i calls himself a burglar whom he's once learned to crack a crib and to carry a revolver in case he's heard upon the stairs As if I over waited pistols' as if I was ever heard as if anybody ever heard or caught me in a house I Ah ' claude, it was a great misfortune for v on when your father was lagged "i You'll never understand with them prejudices of yours what a misfortune it was You've got a quick eye, and a light trend, and clean fingers You would have equalled your father almost, yon couldn't surpass him And I'd always made up my mind that to do with you And now it is come to this-a black coat and a tall hot-tall like a swell lodging among the la wiora-ortiiullj among the lawyers my own ton-Jim Corey's son-among the lawyers'-and tonic thing pointed! in the bookmaking line Well, on 1 W H »aying-this bottle's most e spry, go and get me another It's cool stuff and caines a man along better than brand As I was saying, the profession in clean ruined by revolvers, it's getting low, there's no place in a neat job But there, nothing good ever came from America jet I am getting old now, and I doubt if I shall ever do much more, my boy. but it's heart-breaking to find yourself forgotten after all that's been done As for work, why should I work any more, when I've a beautiful, dutiful, affectionate wife to ket p me, not to speak of a wife and two daughters, and two other sons even one of whom desires nothing so much as to welcome back the fond father they have lost He is a ticket-of-leave man he is repentant, and is open to the tender influences of awakening grace, and understands at lost the Christian virtues and has cast off the works of darkness The good chaplain was s so, and the chaplain ought to know 1 oeauM) he's always convening such a lot of wicked sinners and a-giving of 'em the best of characters It's a contrite spirit-oh'-and a broken heart!' " *' Mine Enemy " will be read with interest in Australia. It is a story of the old convict times a little melodramatic and over sentimental perhaps, but very exciting Another good paper is "J orly Newspaper Sketches," and "The Prima' gives one quite new ideas of the faculties and courage of that little known animal All the verve goes out of the political article in Jîîaci.iioexi when a Liberal Government out of office It is like the " paddle back after a great boatrace triumphant, but rather unmeaning Yet this month's article is not an amusing The gist of the advice given is that the Tory magnates should at least plotted to consult the people, and be less like the " debilitated cousin in " Bleak House " "The ones, who have what is called position,' must meet the voters and their families, and get to know them in a public fashion, at their forefathers knew the limited circle of their political supporters individually Those who are now the rank and file of the party must meet the lenders local and national leaders from time to time the leaders must stimulate the energy of the followers by being among them, during their enthusiasm, and inspecting, and thus encouraging, their work The new rule must feel that those who are by the turn of wheel placed above them in the social scale and in sympathy with them in the work they have to do, which can be no longer the work of individuals, but must be that of the many inspired by the few Inactivity can no longer be masterly To be inactive is to abandon the position And there never was a time when the abandonment of the position meant such ignominy as now." This is all very true and most refreshing but it has a certain air of condescending patronage that betrays the Tory pure and simple Mrs Marian Crawfords 3 Sraracinfca " is a story of the old Roman nobility It is powerful in plot and full of incident but a little too much removed from English ways and thoughts to be attractive to the general reader "Coincidences " is one of the ghost stones for which Blackwood used to be famous. This particular ghost story, however, does not compel bol of as a decent ghost story should, and has too much the air of making up The Century is worth its full page to musical people for the single article on Liszt with its two exquisite portraits The second his ment of "The Casting Away of Mrs. Leeks and Mrs Aleshtno" is as full of peculiarly subtle American humour as the first. The humour is not discernible at once but after reading the story one gipglcB at intervals for a day or two " Balloon Experiences of a Timid Photographer" is another capital paper, and the whole number is above the average American girls are so dainty and pretty that one wonders why American artists always draw vulgar and commonplace women 'This at once strikes one in the illustrations to Our Pilgrimage '' in Harper's Maqa style On the other hand, ' Shorthorn Cattle " is beautifully illustrated, and the texture of the costs is a real triumph of engraving skill Working Men in the British Parliament why will Americans perpetuate the vulgar error of " British," for " English is a readable article, but on the whole the literary matter of this month's number is by no means remarkable In the Cornhill Mr. Haggard in bringing " Jess " nearer to the time of the Boer uprising in South Africa and the story is becoming very exciting "A Prodigal Son' is a modern "version of the Scriptural parable and "The Blue Curtains" is founded on the old theme of the cold hearted girl who marries for money and drives her poor lover to despair Both these stones show Some good literary craftsmanship but the art of writing short stories is not flourishing now a-days. Of the remaining papers the description of the queer combination of civilisation and utter barbarism the American " Cow Pox," is the best. The Magazine of Art for September is a good number It contains, inter alia, illustrated articles on " Paul Baudoy," the French decorative painter, on " Current Art," on the " Old Charter House," and on " Cullercoats," a Northumbrian village. ' Mr. Grant Allen, in "In All Shades," the serial running in Chambers' Journal, has now introduced his readers to the awful scenes of bloodshed and savagery which characterised the rising of the West Indian negroes. Whether such scenes fall within the province of legitimate art may be doubted, but there is no question about Mr. Grant Allen's power of exciting our horror. Of the miscellaneous articles, " Winds of Heaven," by Mr. Richard Jefferies, and "Jewel and Gom Rogueries" are the best. The Illustrated, Naval and Military response is full of papers which must interest officers of the two services. It contains the clearest, and, we may add, the most damnatory, history of the Ordnance scandals that has yet appeared. We have to acknowledge the Girl's Own Paper, the Boy's Own Paper, Leisure Hour, The Sunday at Home, Little Folks, The Quiver, and Cassell's Family Magazine. Of those, special attention should be called to Little Folks, which is really the best children's periodical news published, Roumania is making praiseworthy efforts to show her flag at sea, The training ship Marion, with a crew of 100 of whom 50 are boys, after cruising in the Black Sea and visiting the Russian and Turkish ports, passed through the straits recently on her way to the Archipelago, to cruise among the Greek islands and along the coast of Asia Minor, after which she returns to the Danube, Tile Mirica is being fitted with an auxiliary engine of British build.- She is a fine vessel, most creditably officered and I managed as a school of practical navigation.-Jfiwiil forces'
