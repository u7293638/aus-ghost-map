fflMscellaneous. Grandmother Gray. BY MBS. M. L. BATHE. I THINK Tommy Gray fully appreciated, the fact that his bread was buttered on both sides for when he got into a street riot with Charlie Wilson, who threatened to tell Tommy's father and get him an "all-fired lickin'," Master Tommy just ran off saying: " Dassn't! I've got a grandmother tew home." Tommy's grandmother was the kind ,of a woman who is all fire and flame in youth and all asheB-of-rose in old age. She had been a beauty once, but there was nothing to show for it but " the tender grace of a day that was dead." Wrinkles had taken the place of dimples, her eyes had burned themselves out, her cheeks were shrivelled, and as for teeth she had Only two in her head. " But, thank the Lord, they are opposite t'each other," said Grandmother Gray. She had a lapftfor the children, too—most grandmothers don't have any lap—and she sung them to sleep every night. Tommy had made her promise in an unguarded moment that she would rock him to sleep until he was 21\. She seemed in a fair way to do it, but she reposed his overgrown feet and limbs on a chair and fondled the curly head till he had just " awakeness" left, after his grand matin vespers, to enable him to steer straight to bed. The Bongs she suifg were very funny ones, or very sorrowful. They were either of the " tirooral- to-loo" order, or like " HarkTfrom the tombs a doleful sound." What Tommy liked most was the Scotch ministrelsy. He never tired of " Over the water and over the lea, And over the water to Charley. Oh, Charley loves good ale and wine And Charley loves good brandy, And Charley loves to kiss the girls As" 8weet as sugar candy." Tpmmy thought there was an educational difference between him and Charley, but be made no comment fftr fear of being deprived of the music. On Sundays she sang: " I'm wearin' awa, Jean, Like snaw wreath in thaw,'dean, I'm wearin' awa To the land o' the led." " An' what is 1 the leal,' grandmother ? " Tommy would ask. And the aged woman would fix her sad, tired, patient eyes on the blue beyond and make answer in her low, quavering voice: "It's aye to be true, ma boy, true to your king, true to your God, and ower true to yoursel'." The old lady had some quaint ways; ' One of these was always to attend the grandest church in the parish, where a celebrated divine preached in the modern vernacular of amended theology. " Why do you go to hear so difficult a preacher ? someone asked the old lady. " Do you understand him ? " " Na," she answered, " I dinna hear a word that he says." " Then what pleasure can you "get out of his sermons." "ChildI" answered the old lady re verently, " can't I see the holy wag of his head?" . " Is there a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, grandmother ? " that graceless Tommy would ask. " Aye, child." " And does anybody find it ? " "Aye, many. And they.go far first. It's not in the fleshyou'll findwhat lies hid at the end of the rainbow." She-could tell time by the flowersand the sun. She had seen a ghost. She could find Job's coffin in the sky. She had a charm for bruises and cuts. It was like entertaining an angel unawares to have this dear old lady with them, for, under her little superstitions, lay a grand soul. One day she counted her years and said— " I'm getting old." - " Nonsense, mother," they laughed at her. " You are only a girl of 80." " I remember when I was 18, and had roses on my cheeks," she said. " I wonder when they will ever be there again." One night the children went into her room to be rocked. She sat in the twilight, and tbe lamp was uiilit. She sent them away, first kissing them all around. She kissed Tommy twice; he looked like his grandfather whose likeness she had worn in a breastpin for forty years. " I'm expectin' company," she said to them. " Gang your ways, and God's blessing go with ye." - It was Tommy who jumped up in the night from a fearful dream and ran into grandmother's room for comfort. She still Bat in the window. At least her figurewas there, but Grandmother Gray had gone away with her company.
