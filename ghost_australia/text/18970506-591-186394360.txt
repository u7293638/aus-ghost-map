A CORRECTION. TO THK EfilTOH OF THE LEADEIl. .SIR.—IN your report of the welcome social to Rev. James Lowe I am rejires.uiited as having Kttid that "I was sui-ry for the displ ace of Home who were Episcopidly oi-daiiiod," and that "I prayed that our ministers might never become Episcopalians." 1 said no such thing ; but what I did say was this—We Methodists think a great deal of our ministers, but we were told the other day in one of our papers that we had no ii;-'lit to call our ministers clergymen because they were not Episcopally ordained. We carecl little for that; what's in a name ? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet! We eared not what name our minister was called so long as he had the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost given unto him. We maintain that Methodist ministers arc in the Apostolic succession, because they can show Apostolic results ; and if the laying on of the hands of a bishop were responsible for the intolerance we read about, and the uncharitableness that we have seen not one hundred miles from Numurkah, then we will ever pray that our ministers lie saved from Episcopal ordination."—Yours etc., ' S. G.
