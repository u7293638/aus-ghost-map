Topographical Tips in Proverbial Philosophy. (Dedicated, without permission, by our past (i)randial poet, to the Ghost of Martin Tupper.) I. Similia similibus curantur.— Hahnemann. |H| HERE was an ©Id man of Seringa- III patam, l!" Who lived upon nothing but Cran- JL, berry jam. One year Cranberries failed. And the poor old man ailed ; But they cured him with powders, and very fat ham. II. The gods are just, and of our pleasant yices, Make instruments to plague us .-Shakeepere. An idle young lady of Reading Her needle was constantly threading; But of work was there fit To be seen deuce a bit : — So they quietly put off her wedding. III. La donna e nobile.— Victor Hugo. A plaguey fine widow of Chergavenny Behaved just like ice, when rich suitors were many ; But when they were few, You could not only view, But quite bask in her smiles, and yet pay ne'er a penny. IV. Discretion, the best part of valour.— Beaumont and Fletcher. A courageous young man of Hyde Park Once determined to tame a grey shark. As food, Mr. Babbage Suggested red cabbage, Well pickled, and kept in the dark. It was cooked by the dynamo-spark, And they offered a plateful to shark. Rut the wily old sinner Just glanced at his dinner, And ate — the young man of Hyde Park. Thus — Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.- Pope.
