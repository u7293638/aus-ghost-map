THE BOARD AND THE MINING DEPARTMENT. The Chairman stated the steps which he, and the sub-committee appointed for the purpose, had taken in protesting against the action of the Mining Department in attempting to deprive the Board of its right to exercise patronage in the matter of appointing Mining Registrars and Surveyors. The protest arose upon the action of the Department in reference to the Blue Mountain Rush, in which the Board defended their officer (Mr Surveyor Turner, of Taradale.) He (the Chairman) had drawn up a lengthy re- monstrance, but the sub-committee (represented by Messrs Bagshawe and Wilson) had rejected that and substituted a brief protest, which in his (the Chairman's) opinion failed in stating those points which it was most necessary should be prominently placed before the Department. This being the case, he had postponed forward ing the brief protest, thinking it better to submit it, together with the lengthy remonstrance which he had himself drawn up, to the whole Board, leaving it for them to deal with the matter. Mr Wilson moved, That the remonstrance drawn up by himself and Mr Bagshawe be adopted. Mr Bagshawe seconded the motion, urging that brevity was a great virtue in such affairs. Mr Baird demurred to the tone assumed by Messrs Wilson and Bagshawe, in the face of the able and. elaborate protest drawn up by the Chairman. The protest was made against the system of departmental interference ; it was not directed against the political head, but against the permanent head of the Mining Department. He therefore moved as an amendment the adoption of the Chairman's pro test. Mr Edwards seconded the amendment, con- sidering that it was highly necessary to vindi cate the right of the Board to exercise patron age, and protest against the undue interference of the Department with the working miners in the locality in question. After further remarks from various members, in support of the amendment Mr Wilson re- plied. On the votes being taken the amendment was carried. : ' /yandoit / gold.-fields' : ' common," l'j /Mr/Edinfrds introduced/Mr; /Naiiriij Tone of 'tho Managers of this Common, -who desired thq assistance of the Bbdrd'ia obtaining an extension of its /boundaries.

The Chairman stated that ' the Minister for Mines objected to the extent of tho area pro posed in section 2 ; if tho urea were reduced to about 5 or 8 acres the Government would not object, but they certainly, would objoct to grant ing 21 acres, or the result of that would bo to reduce tho revenue, us the number of miners' rights taken out would be still less than at pro- sent.' The question of the labour basis wns quito anothor one, with which the Board must deal. But it wutfforrthc Mining-Department to veto the ? extension ))or diminution of the 'Mi? Baird said he had no objection to a reduc tion of the area from that originally proposed by him ; he attached more importance to the re duction of the labour basis. Mr Wilson here - introduced Messrs. Colling nnd Landey as a deputation from tho miners ot Strntliloddon, to protest against section 2 of Mr Landey acted as spokesman, remarking that they came boforo tho Board to protest- against tho bye-law, believing tliat_ if it become law It would lDIllCu U OWIUUD miners of the district. He proceeded to stato tho reasons for the objections as follows:— That the former bye-law No. 15 has answered all the requirements. of the minor and capitalist. That such a sweeping chango in our mining legislation should have been brought boforo tho miners at the annual election of members of the Mining Board, so' as to have a full and free expression of opinion. (Hear, hear.) Such not being, the ease, it seems .covert , conduct, in a member to, bp his first get lifter election,. no alteration of cir cumstances occurring in the meantime.
