NEWCASTLE. j at jjTtoM ona connBsroynENT.I * . JULY 15 -The recent bad weather appears to have taken off, but the sky still remains cloudy and dull. The news of the massacres of the unfortunate population of the outlying districts of New Caledonia has awakened a deep feeling of sympathy for the suffering inhabitants of that colony, in the minds of the people of the district, and no doubt it will afford some consolation to the distressed to hear that the feeling has taken a practical turn amongst the principal people of this city, as elsewhere throughout the colony, where mans will admit of it, and that subventions are being asked for and freely tendered, in order that the unfortunate people may be removed in the hour of their distress The matter of collecting funds in aid of this deserv- ing charity is in the hands hero of the Vice-Consul for France (Mr George Tully) and Mr Henry Bonnard and those gentlemen have already succeeded in raising a considerable sum for the purpose. If instances were wanting of the popularity of his Excellency Sir Hercules Robinson throughout the colony, the nation of the people of New castle may be cited as a pleasing example The news was received here to-day that the term of office of his Excellency, as Governor of the colony, had been extended, and, on the matter becoming known, the sentiments of the people were given vent to in a requisition to his Worship the Mayor, signed by the principal inhabitants of the city, asking that a public meeting be forthwith called, in order that the action of the Home Government in thus responding to the general wish of the colony might be thus approved of An application has been made to the police magistrate for the use of the Court-house on the occasion, and a monster meeting is anticipated Mr ThiToiaÂ» Hungerford, M L A. for the county of Northumberland, appeared before his constituents at the Protestant Hall, Plattsburg, on Saturday afternoon last, and delivered a lengthy address upon his course of action in the Assembly during the late session, and on political matters generally. Mr Hungerford had most attentive hearing throughout, and on the conclusion of his address, WAS awarded a cordial vote of thanks by the large audience which had assembled on the occasion in the way of amusement in the city, we have at present Sam HovviraVa Company still attracting good houses at the Victoria Theatre and our old friend, James Ram- ford, at the Protestant Hall with the Ghost show.
