The^atc Dr. Adolph Saphir, calling to mindt&#-?ourse of Ms early conversion iroin. Judaism* to the- faith, -and service. i*» the Lord Jearaa Ghrisfc, .used; the ?? f ol-' ?owing1 words : ' J was brought - -up in *ny childhood in the synagogue, and was taught that there waa-one God, infin i fte, incomprehensible/ ? holy-Spirit, high' above us and omnipresent.' .?-Much.1 stress -was laid on the unity and-unicity,. of God. But this bare, vague, and^ab-; strict -monotheism leaveB the mind in darkness, while the heart as chilly ?*. and desolate. There -was another, and better current -which-- .then, influenced, me. It-was the national history. There I -was met by no abstractidea of unicity but. by a loving God. who appeared -to. Abraham and' apoke to him ; and after,; ?when I thoughts? the friendly, con-' crete, kind, and human way in which the Lord. Go4.- .thus appeared unto His people,an-l dwelt with- th em, I wonder ed; ?why HeTrasnot now with., us, known, loved,-;«nd .? followed. One day I was looking at some books, and the title, of. one- arrested my eye. It was Die mensch toerdung Gofies-r-rGod becoming. . man. The » thought went through ?. my. mind like a .flash- of lightning ; it thrilled 2iy soul- with a most joyous solemnity. Oh ! I . said, this would be ? the inost beautiful tiling, t it' God ? i were^ to, become, man and visit us 1. Nofe many years after I heard about- Jesus, and read the gospels. I felt here Vthe same presence, the same loving,;con ''descending, redeeming, and -sanctifying God that appeared unto the .fathers:* .1 felt that here was Jehovah, that; all darkness had disappeared, and that '.the grand bat ?? inconceivable ? glory - here shone upon usin the perfectj peaceful; and .holy countenance of the .

The disciples had been thinking that '?He which should redeem Israel'.' had left them to themselves. In successive ippearances the risen Lord ahowed them ;hat,thpugh they saw Him not, as form '??-sriy, every day and, if thay wanted,' all She day long, yet they were not for Bakenby, Him. He was producing in them a fai};h. needful to prepare them lor the tim.e approaching when He WouM discover Himself to their bodily eyesno more— the faith, that, if invisible. He was. not absent. Let them be sure that He would still keep as near to them as 'when they looked upon His moving lips.and listened to His human -voice.
