The Appealito Harold.* Haro I Harol Judge now betwixt this woman and me, Haro I She leaves me bound, who found mefree. Ol love and hope she hath drained me dry Yea, barren as a drought-struck sky; She hath not left me tears for weeping, Nor will my eyelids close in sleepming. I have gathered all my life's-blood up Haro I She hath drunk and thrown aside the cup. Shall she not give me back my days? Haro i I made them perfect for her praise. There was no flewer in all the brake I found not fairer for her sake; There was no sweet thought I did not fashion For aid and servant to my passion. Labor and learning worthless were, Haro I Save that I made them gifts for her. Shall she not give me back my nights ? Haro ! Give me sweet sleep for brief delights? Lo I in the night's wan mid I lie, And ghosts of hours that are dead go by: Hours of a love that died unshriven; Of a love in change for my honor given: She caressed and slew my soul's white truth, Haro I Shall she not give me back my youth? eHaro ! Hare I Tell thou me not of a greater judge, Hare . It is he who hath my sin in grudge. Yea, from God I appeal to thee; God hath not part or place for me. Thou who hast sinned, judge thou my sin ning; Ihave staked my life for a woman's winning. She hath etripped me of all save remember ing Haroe ! Right thou me, right thou me, Harold the Kingl -H. C.
