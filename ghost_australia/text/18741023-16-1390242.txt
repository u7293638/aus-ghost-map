rJ?elegi*a,pliic Sydney. lUTvrnui^ tssocituD mess] October 22 Till: Government have received a telegram from London stating that Sir Charles Cowper, the Agent-General, is seriously ill. The shipowners are projecting the establishment of a Mutual Marine Insurance Company. The Jessie Kelly, schooner, which arrived from Noumea yesterday, reports that the natives of the Santa Cruz group had seized the Lapwing, cutter, hailing from Auckland, murdered all hands, and burned the vessel. HILL. schooner Sand By was also attacked by the natives while lying becalmed off Santa Cruz. The crew successfully resisted the attack, and the breeze freshening, the safety of the vessel was secured. At the wool sales to-day a large business was again done ; parcels of greasy sold from 9d. to 11d. per lb. Arrived : City of Brisbane, s., from Brisbane. melbourne. [weatherman associated rains.] October 22. In the Legislative Assembly this afternoon the adjourned debate on Air. Woods' motion, to authorise the opening of museums and other public institutions on Sundays, was resumed. The resolutions are not likely to be carried. Sales of wheat at 5s. d. to 5s. 2d. per bushel. Two cargoes of maize changed hands at prices ranging from 5s. 6d. to 3s. 8d. per bushel. Eight hundred boxes of candles sold at 8d, per lb., and a parcel of Eleme raisins at 63d. per lb., in bond. SEVERNE, contributions of interest have lately been made to the Brisbane Museum, which is gaining in importance, and also, sportingly, in favor with the general public. Amongst the donations made during the past mouth is a bas- relief map of the south-east portion of England, specially intended to show the geological formations likely to be met with in the construction of the projected under-sea railway between England and France. The proposed line, as marked on the map, is from the South Foreland to a point near Calais. The map was presented by Mr. Daintree. Mr Davidson, chemist, of Stanthorpe, has forwarded a specimen of a death adder, two feet six inches in length, with fangs of nearly half an inch, and is one of the largest of this description of reptile. Another interesting item is a collection of fossils, from the lower chalk formation at the head of the Walsh River. This contribution was made by Mr. Barron, and, together with a similar dona- tion made by Mr. G. Bonnett, jim., from the well-known fossils of Gowrie Creek, will be found worthy of inspection by persons of scientific tastes. Mr. Bray, of the Tweed River, has Xirosonted specimens of a blind snake or worm (not venomous), two scorpions, two lizards, and a centipede ; while Mr. Churchouso has", added to the museum quite a number of Maori curiosities, amongst which the story of a model canoe, and a snare for catching pigeons, are deserving of notice. This latter is an extremely simple and apparently easily constructed contrivance, and we should say, judging from an experiment made, very effective in its operation. Several other contributions of an interesting nature have lately been made, and it is obvious that the dimensions of the present building are far too small for the increasing demands upon its space As showing the increased attention which is being paid to the institution by the public, we give the numbers of visitors who have attended during the past four months June, 400 ; July, 770 ; August, 1221 ; September, 1673. The Government have decided on making certain paper many changes in the Dei artment of Lands Hitherto, a great want of co-operation between the sea near races under the Minister has existed, and the late enquiry by the Commission appointed to consider the method of keeping the public accounts elicited informs tion, showing that a certain amount of intago msm very prejudicial to efficiency ousted be til been the v ii ions independent branches It has now been detet Time I to centre all administer a as of authority in the Under Sec start the Sur fever General bolac, charged only with the management of sm i boys and the custody of plans The two branches lull therefor the amalgamated, the Sun es or General being subordinate to the Under Secretary Ali Geo Huntley at present chief clerk in the Survey Office, will be transferred to the administrative branch, taking rank as senior clerk Thl seemingly ever present English mail is again a source of irritation to our business men.

seemed from a collection (and possibly f i ora experience) not altogether acceptable to certain of the white residents even when it came to them with the comfort table assurance that it was impossible to leave the islands to themselves the enormous debt of Â£87 000 was deemed a comparatively small matter in view of the interests involved, of the fertility of the group to be annexed, and of the greatness, and wealth of the nation by which this annexation was to be brought about-but almost every respectable white resident here seems to have been utterly astonished and confounded at the antecedent proposition laid down by the Minister, that if the cession of the islands is to be accepted and it would appeal to be taken for granted that the Fijian authorities are to have no option but to cede the Bia tish Crown must have a light of preemption in all the lands This weighty condition that the and must follow the rule which has been adopted elsewhere, and grants be all made from the Crown has acted like a douche of cold water upon the sides of the most eager and influential of the annexa- coasts and it proved unquestionably the cause of the absolute failure of the public meeting here on Wednesday last week On that occasion, the 16th instant, the meeting of planters called for at M'Cnllums Comment cud Reading rooms, for the purpose of arranging present series for i planters address to His Excellency Sir Hercules Robinson, wished thinly attended There were, says the Tyr 'fines, 'only ten or twelve planted s present, and consequently nothing it is done The severe down colony type, and the proposed arrangements as to the titles for land, have proved to be most unwelcome conditions to both of the two classes of white west dents-those whose opinions and interests should be most anxiously consulted, and those who will use or be disposed to have very for vent admiration for any kind of Government, least of all one of severe Crown type So that we necessarily remained for several days after the late important news of an apathetic (not to say sullen) state, waiting, like Mr Micawber, to see what would turn up next A LETTER is published in the Lyttelton Press of October 2, from a man named H E M Smythe, stating that he captured two in of areas at Brown mg s Pass on September 20 Smythe says, when he was near the top of the saddle his dogs suddenly set off at a great pace, and commenced barking furiously He followed, and after going a short distance, to his inexpressible astonishment saw two large birds, one of % gigantic height, and one smaller On seeing the dogs getting the worst of the fight, he ran back and cooeyed" to his mate, after which he got a tether rope, and under shelter of a small patch of bush 30s behind the largest budgeted it at first, when he took a turn round a birch tree with the rope Contrary to expectation the large bud did not show fight to any great extent, and the smaller one remained quietly by After this he had little trouble to secure the legs of the large bird, and left it fastened to a tree for two cups, the young one making no effort to leave its mother On the following Thursday, with the assistance of Frampton's shepherds, he took the old bird to the camp, the young one following The old bird is 8ft. high, and the "young one 5ft The former appears reconciled to captivity
