THE ALBUM. My photograph album T Certainly. Yon can look, if you wish, my dear ; To mo it is just like a graveyard, Though I go through it once a year. Any new faces T No, indeed. No, I stopped collecting some years ago. And yet, Jeanette, look well at the book, It ia full of histories strance : The faces are just an index, dear, To stories of pitiful change — Drama and poem and tragedy, Which I alone have the power to see. Ah ! I thought you would pause at that lacs ; She was fair as a poet's lay. The sweet rose of her English home ; Yet she perished far, far away, In the black massacre at Cawnpore She suffered and died — we know no more. And that? Ah, yes, 'tis a noble head 1 Soul sits on the clear, lofty brow ; She was my friend in the days gone by. And she is my enemy now. Mistake, and wrong, and sorrow — alas 1 One of life's tragedies— let it pass. This face ? He was my lover, Jeanette, And perchance he remembers to-day Thepassionate wrong that wrecked ns both When he sailed in his anger away. Heart-sick and hopeless through weary years, At length I forgot him— despite these tears. That handsome fellow? He loved me too, And he vowed he would die, my dear, When I told him ' No !' 'tis long ago : He married the very next year. That one I liked a little, but he Cared much for my gold, nothing for me. Brides and bridegrooms together, dear, And most of them parted to-day ; Some famous men that are quite forgot, Some beauties faded and grey. Close the book, for 'tis just aa I said Full of pile ghosts from a life that's dead. —ffar/Kr', Weekly.
