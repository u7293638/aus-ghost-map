request) the prcsbj tcry expresses tho hope that tliH discussion «111 bo overrule 1 for the maintenance of that purity of doctrino set forth In our standards which we have all pledged ourselves to maintain and defend Ile said that if he had choseu ho would have been able to say a great deal about Hegel and Schliermacher and Baur, but he did not feel it necessary to do so He did not regret what had been said respecting those writers or their teachings, but ho believed the presbytery had had quite enough of that line of talk, and that as they were settling this question before practical people, they should now as practical men try to arrive at a finding that would be satisfactory to all parties With that view he would refrain from quoting from a most searching article m the New ZmUui I Pretbiiterian of thiB month on the present case '1 he Rev M Macdonald hadBtated his view of the case exhaustively, and on the other hand Mr Stobbs m Ins speech had grappled with the subject in a masterly manner, and therefore he (the Rev W G I raser) thought the presbytery could now dispense with long analytic speeches on the position m which they found them selves I hey hld got into a diflicult position and the question before the court was, now were they to r,et out of it honourably, and come to a finding as a couit of Christ s Church ' The Rev M Macdonald 8 motion proposed at the commencement of it that they Bhould approve generally of the report of the committee which he (the Rev W G I raBer) could not do, because if he had felt what the committee appeared to have felt he would have been bound to go much further than they proposed '1 he »rat part of the finding said Mr Strong seemed to ?view the subject from the standpoint of those who ignored the miraculous facts of the gospel and supernatural divine revela tion and if he had felt Mr Strong did ao, lie would hive said the conclusion of the committee waa a very lame one an J he would certainly have proceeded to libel Mr Strong After stating that he could not sup port all the matter in the motion and iimendments which had been proposed 1 efore his own amendment wag fciven in he Bald that he thought tho time for asking Mr Stron" for an explanation was now past If Mr Strong hid given a few avorda of explanation at fir3t ho believed they would hive been all agreed now, and have had tho matter Bettled, but that remark com polled him to go back to the introduction of the -vhole matter into tho presbytery In doing bo he would sav nothing about private meetings held on the subject Hie matter carne before the presbytery on"iuatly as a proposal for a conference Now he never jet hcird of a proposai to go into conference beint, made and being followed by plunging | immediately into the merits of the case In this ciee however, on the proposal for i con ference the Rev Mr M1 ichran and the Rev Mr Hamilton read long papera on the merits and he (the Rev W O I raser) thought there was a wrong done to Tr Strong in that course-that he was publicly impeached on a proposal for a conference ïhat w13 un fortunate, because Mr Strong had been forced as it were, into a corner, und now end, ' You have allon ed the accuäa tioiiB to to forth over the length and breadth of the country, j ou have done mo a wrong and therefore 5 ou must prove 3 ou are right, or condemn me Mr Strong hld taken up that position and it ?nia impossible as it Boomed to him (the Ret 1\ C I raatr) to dislodge him from it It waB not right therefore for the presbjtery f o íibk Mr Strong to explain, and he (the R«v V, G 1 raser) felt that there waa no likeli hood of his doing so, as he might at any htage of the discussion hitherto have got up mid dont so By the papers of the Rev Mr M 1 athrin and the Rev R Hamilton which he (the lev W G1 raser) bad referred to ind which were made public, Mr Strong was \irtually au accused man Uhe Rev C Si ron 0-A condemned criminal 'lue Rev Vf GitousDWvTEit ratSLii con tinned -Ho could not for the reasons he had stated agree to the other amendments pro posed but as some part of his own amendment agreed with part of the motion of the Rev 31 Macdonald, and with the amendment of the Rev S Robinson of St Kilda, he thought they might come to some agreement so that they could adopt one motion to settle the question They were discussing this matter before a practical public and the public asked what was the use of all the talk about Hegel and Schliermacher and Baur, when they had not told them what the systems of these men were Now he wanted to make known what their standards were and to state them plainly, so that all might know the position the church took up He would fight for those standards, which were far more liberal than were some of those who pretended to have signed them lhere was a rumour that the committee had actually discarded the speeches of Mr M'Eachran and Mr Ilamil ton which he had mentioned, and bad framed their report irrespective of them, and if that were so, there was the more honour to the committee for going into the matter with clean hands In his amendment he had I heed the words" that whilst the presbjtery rçgrets that occasion should have been tuen for serious doubts and difliculties re yarding the soundness of Mr Strong a utterances m his article on the Atone ment Several brethren wanted to caution Mr Strong but he thought the whole matter had been ' caution enouji to the prcsbvtery already Ho hid no sympathy willi the Scots Church over which Mr Strong presided but ho believed the matter j ad been 1 real tuai for Mr Strong, and that lie had lelt it very keenly He objected very much to ' caution for the very reason that they hid not definitely accused Mr Strong J hit gentleman had tal en up a certain posi tion and the presbjtery cou'd not dislodge lum from it 1 hey should not, therefore put «ni caution into their conclusions - it would be like a judge Bajing, ' Not proven my boj but be moro careful that jou do not do it again It would not be right of them as a court of Christ a Church to Bay the c 190 was not proven and then caution Mr Strong not to do so ignin If anj thing was proven ti ey Bhould admonish Mr Strong and lib^l

festo m the ( icfo) ian Review It waa indeed the preBbytery who were called upon to Bay whether they were to be faithful to their ordi nation \owb If they took no action-if they declined to take up the challenge thron n out, without doubt they would be charged with cowardice Tho committee appointed to examine the article comprised 10 able and honourable men, and it waa unfair to eny that they were biassed Bimply because the presbytery did uot compel certain others to act with them .hey had given the article a fair and acnoua consideration Out of l8 particulara noted, the committee were unanimous on II, and out of four find inga they were unanimous on two These tnoafhrmed \eiy grave thing3-chielly that llie article left out the aubstitutionary sacrifice of Chriat 1 he dissentients agreed to No G of the particulars, and diaagrced with No 12 1 here waa no dissent to No 14 and yet there were two dissents to the first finding, which was substantially the same Ile supported the part of tho original motion for the adoption of the report, and ho legretted that tho motion could not be severed In regard to Mr Strong, a great deal had been aaid about brotherly love, but it bad been thought proper to Buck Iiib brethren with arrows-very pointed remarks, in fact It was said tho more charitable course would have been to havo spoken to Mr Strong privately But there wa3 a charity for others to be considered as well aa for Air Strong lhere wus a charity to the immortal eoula of their Hocks and that was the highest fonn of charity Above ill things, it was the duty of a munster to teach the doctrines of the church In a discipline for immorality it would have been unfair to make a man Ins own accuser, but here it was only a question of opinion It was no crime to differ with the preabytery on a point of religioua belief, but it waa necessary that the church should be in accord on all the essential points of their faith Unless they atood on a common ground they were disintegrated-they vvero a mob instead of a body Whatever carno of this matter, he trusted it would go forth to all that they had the courage of their opinions -that they were not hypocrites when they Bigned the Btandarda, and that they vvero not cow ards to refuse to take up a challenge w hen it was thrown down Hie Kev J Bui vatim: rose to move the following amendment ' The presbytery approve the report in its general tone and tcnour, ti anl the committee, and discharge it Hn! " 1 TI at while the report shows that statements of a doubtful doctrinal character occur In tho article on the Atonement, by the Rev Charlea Strong, in tho ' \lctorian Review, it dots not set forth that Bald articlo contains any positive affirmations tint are at vallance with the Btandardsof the church ' 2 That it Is matter of regret that the articlo re fcrrcd to should apparently bo so wanting in clear ness fulness, and cxpllcitness of statement on tho cardinal doctrino of winch it trcatB,as held hy this church, ns to f,ive occasion for uiieaslnc.3 or alarm on ti e ] art of u any oí its ministers and pooplo ' d That in the absence of explanations from Mr Strong on tho points in nucsnon, it may bo difficult to remove tho doubts which havo boen awakened as to his soundness In tho faith and his loyalty to the standards of the church and tint, therefore, it ia deemed au act of brotherly regvrd respectfully to sug f,cBt whether it lo not duo to lils cluracter an I MSltiouaB a mininer of the church, as wull aB to lils I rethren and the churches at Iarc,o toolfcrauch explanation as will, II posslblo, accompliah tills do siral lo end ' finally, the presbytery, taking Into consideration the extent to which teachings of an unsettling ten dency prevail in various sections of tho Christian church at the present time, deem It opportune to ex press the conviction that It Is Incumbent on tho ministers of our church to see to it that they give no uncertain sound in proclaiming and defending the central doctrine of our venerated faith, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,' a volun tary and vicarious sacrifice, thus making atone ment ' He said he was very reluctant to move an additional amendment, and he should not have submitted it had there been a proposi tion before the court he could conscientiously support No one was responsible for this amendment but himself It was not his in tention to sail into tho cloudland of German theology, but he must say that he should greatly regret to see the influence of the teachings of the German philosophers intro duced here, because he believed its tendency to be entirely destructive of Christianity However, the influence of the systems which had been referred to was on the wane on the Continent of Europe These systems had beaten out religious life in Ger many 'They were totally inadequate to satisfy the wants of tho human soul He (Mr Ballantyne) stated reasons why ho could not agree with various points in the difierent amendments, and then explained the grounds on which he moved hia own amendment In it he proposed that the prosbjtcry ahould approve of the general tone and tenour of the report, becauso while he did not think the majority of them woald approve of everything m it, ho thought most of them would approvo of it m ita general tone and tenour The firat division of his amendment, he said, contained only a simple fact W ith respect to the second proposal in the amendment, he believed that everybody, even including Mr Strong, regretted that the article had been published, and ho waa very much inclined to think that if Mr Strong were called upon to write the article again, ho would not wnto it in the same terms, but would deal more fully with the doctrine of the Presbyterian Church on the Atone nient As to tho third division of the amendment, he said that ho looked upon Mr Strong as a gentleman of high character, and a brother minister of unimpeachable character and great ability and influence He desired to deal with Mr Strong tenderly, respectfully, candidly, and fairly, and therefore he proposed that they should BUggcBt to him the propriety of ex- planations, in order to remove tho doubts which undoubtedly had arisen m regard to bim. When they Lad done that, they would have acted as Chnatian men should act, and they could not go further before they had done it ne could not tell what might har pen in the future if Mr Strong declined to explain, but by adopting the course he suggested, they would be conserving the dignity of the church The final diviBion of his amendment referred to the extent to which teachings of an unsettling tendency prevailed in the church at the present time, and they all knew that Buch teachings prevailed in Europe, in America, and in these colonies Any time was a fitting one to call attention to the effects of thoao teachings, but the pre sent waa an eapeciully fitting time and ho therefore proposed that the presbytery should refer to them now The Rev D Mackfn71f who sconded Mr Ballantynes amendment, expressed his re gret that the question waa plunged into at once by certain speakers immediately it was initiated before the prcBbjtery It would have been better for the brethren who ongi nally felt themselves aggrieved to have gone to Mr Strong and have asked him for the explanations they now asked from the preBbytery Had they done bo, he believed Mr Strong would have received them aa a brother, and given them to understand what his meaning was Another course alao might bat e been adopted Thoao who felt aggrieved might have met together, and have deputed one or two of themBClvea who were the moat able on tho various theological doctrines to write another article in tho Review replying lo that of Mr Strong After the matter was, however originated m the presbytery a com mittce ot the most able men were appointed, and ho confessed they had done their work well The question had assumed great and "rave dimensions, and it was not now ono merely between a minister of the church and themselves, but it waa one they must deal with in the pre pence of the Christian public, and of the Presbyterian Church throughout tho world 1 heir duty now waa to put forth a manifesto in regard to the opiniona and viewa they held on the great central doctrine of their faith, and to put it forth not only before Melbourne but before the whole world Iho motion of Mr J Ballantyne, he believed, just met that view, and ho therefore Bccondcd it Mr Strong might perhaps be right in refusing to car lain, but he believed it would have been better if Mr Strong had, when Mr M 1 acbran first brought the matter forward, given an explanation, and bo have prevented the agitation and turmoil which prevailed, and which must be hurtful to the great in- teresta of religion If Mr Strong refused to give any explanation on him the onus would rcBt, but the church, in auggeating that he should do so, aa waa proposed in the amendment would not be stultify nig itself, and otherwise it might do bo Mr K IfAiirEit aaid it was not his intcn tion to have spoken on the matter, but he felt now »hat, aa the representative elder of loornk Church, of which the Rev M Mac donald waa the minister, it was his duty to do so Vi hen he read the article, aB a simple layman, not understanding the jargon of Hegel or any other of the Germanisms he felt there was a very great defect in it Coming, aa the article did from a clergyman of the church, and treating of the Atone ment-the central truth of their church-he felt that it waa like the play of "Hamlet with Hamlet left out (Hear hear ) What struck him about the article was that every possible view of the Atonement which had been put forward from the time Christ was on the earth to the present day was treated of with considerable fullneas but that the view which the Presbyterian Church and which every member of it had subscribed to was alluded to as if it hardly existed (Hear hear ) There w ob simply only a passing allusion to it The Rev J ïïav. rose to order The doe trine of the church waa fully and clearly Btoted m the article, and Mr Harper waa making a wrong aBBertion 1 he AIodlii vron held that Mr narper waa not out of order Mr R H »ni cn said Mr nay and Mr Strong were equally with him entitled to their own impressions about the article ne was only stating to the presbjtery the im pression made on Ina mind-it might be erroneously-by the article, but if that were so he would like Mr Strong either then or at some future stage to enlighten him and set bim rif_ht As a layman, ond one who did not wish to go into the discussion of those theological questions, what had appeared to his mind and that of many other 1 ty men not only of the Presbyterian Church but of other churches had been the fact that Mr Strong knew well whether he held the views of the Presbyterian Church or not, and that by a simple explanation he could hav e Baved all the trouble and bother which had occurred about the article The Rev C Strong rose to order on a point on which he had previously risen to order W aa it to be understood that Ina conduct in not giving an explanation waa under discus Bion or not' The Hon J Bv.liouR-It is part of the motion Mr B\ll\ntvnf thought the point of order was thiB-seeing that the matter of explana tion waa not in the report was Mr Strong right or not in being under the impression the preaby tery should not travel beyond the report 1 he Hon Mr B vi Foin and other persons -1 he matter of explanation is in tho motion, and therefore before u» Mr R H vin Lit Baid they were dealing with motioiiB before the presbytery which contem plated asking explanations from Mr Strong and therefore he was in order No one knew better than Mr Strong whether he intended to convey the impressions which had been mentioned or to teach the doctrinea of the church and he could explain what he did mean It might have been wiser if the matter had not been brought up at all, but no com plaint could justly lie against the members of a church discuaamg an article which affected their doctrines To call the preliminary meet nig of brethren an underhand and nefarious proceeding was unfair, if it were for no other reason but that caucuses had been held on both sides There were so many amendments now before the house that they would have great difficulty in coming to a decision and he therefore thought the best plan to adopt would he to refer the whole matter at once to the Commiasion, which would meet at Ballarat next week With regard to Ina friend and pastor, the Rev Mr Macdonald, be had been most unfairly and cruelly treated throughout the whole of this business The base and unworthy inainua lions made againat him were utter fabrica tiona (Hear, hear ) He had felt it hia duty aa a faithful munster of tho church to take the action he had done, and he (Mr Harper) would never forget tho tone in which he said to him at the commencement -"You must remember, Mr Harper, it is a serious thing These caBeB generally end in the death of one or more of those who take them up A letter which had appeared against him in the news papers, signed "An filder, was a mixture of fabrications, pure and simple, and be (Mr Harper) challenged the nameleaa scribbler to come forth and make Ina aasertions in public (Applause ) Mr Stewart had said Mr Strong had been annoyed by anonymous letters by that base and moBt contemptibly mall cioua mode of gratifying spite (near, hear) lhere was, however, a defenco against that, for the letters could be quietly burned But there was a gieater deoth of meanness than writing onony mous lettera to individuals, and that was to send anony mous letters to the newspapers, and to accuse in them a brother munster of every contemptible motive that could be named ( Ypplause ) He would conclude by moving 1 That rcicrrhig to tho case now pending regar Un? ti o Rev Charles Strone, s article on tho Atonement In Ho ' Victor! ni Review tho presl ytcrv recclvo

tho superior Hie Rev l)r Mvcdonvld seconded this amendment He had endeavoured, he said, to reserve to himself the poeition of a judge, and naturally enough ho had been getting considerable light on the subject Ho thought at first that the question waa whether the expressions in Mr Strong a article were not consistent with the documenta which they, as members of tho PreBby terian Church, had all signed, and up to the previous day he really did not realise that a number of the brethren had an impression, if not a convie tion, that the objections to the article were very much deeper, and that they went the length of believing that tbo article contained not only unsound words but unaound doe trine Iho motion of Mr Rentoul, indeed, went the length of implying that Mr Strong was a Hegelian, and that ho did not believe in the supernatural at all Some might fancy that ho (Dr Macdonald) was perhaps rather Ioobo as compared with other fathers of the church, but he had no hesitation in saying that if he could believe any brother did not behove or did not preach, tho super natural factB-he would rather call them the plain facts-and doctrines o£ the scriptures, that such a brother Bhould not be a min- ister of the church at all. (Hear, hear ) If for instance any minister did not believe m tho resurrection of Christ he Bhould not bo a minister of any church, or of any Christian denomination But he could not believe Mr Strong bad any doubt on that subject. He was, however, Bomewbat startled by some of the remarks of Mr Yule There was his statement, for instance, with reference to the fitting m of Mr. Strongs article to tho Hegelian groove He did not, however, even yet behove that Mr. Yule or any other brother really held that Mr. Strong vjaa a Hegelian in faith or conviction, but what bad been said explained the action of these brethren. Now, this was a most ?ravo and solemn thing Ho would not Bay whether Mr Strong should make any statement or not, but ho would not blame Mr Strong if be did not explain He had a very Btrong conviction that Mr Strong had not been fairly treated-or at least a regret that he had not been dealt with in a wiser way In placo of a number of the brethren having formed themBelves into a caucus they might rather have called a private meeting of the whole preabytery to consult about the <"aac Mr Strong being present or not, as ho pleased Mr BALLAimi,E (the clerk) -Why did not you propose that ? Dr Macdovai d -Because the whole thing waa settled before it came before the presbj tory Mr Baiiaitivc-I beg to Bay that I had nothing to do with it before it was brought up here Rev D rnASFit -I say the same Dr Macdonald accepted both these state menta Hie Rev S Romvbov aaid he would require Dr Macdonald to declare the names of the brethren ho referred to He (Mr Robinson) attended no caucuB. 'I ho Rev Mr Rentow -I will also demand that Dr Macdonald shall retract the state ment regarding my motion, for it is wholly unfounded I never asserted that Mr Strong does not hold the supernatural I could not have done that 1 had nothing to do with Mr Strong, having 01 ly to criticise bis article, and my charge against it ia that its teaching ia of a wholly negative character Dr Mvcdonald had understood that the implication lay under Mr Rentoul s motion that Mr Strong did not behove in super natural facts (near, hear ) If ho denied the correctness of that conclusion, welland good 'J ho same implication underlaj tho committee 8 report and Mr Macdonald s mo tion ne (Dr Macdonald) then was so shocked it any minister being suspected of such a thing that he could not possibly pro ceed on the supposition that it could be true without a great dell moro proof than he had seen as jet More over, knowing Mr Strong as lie did, he had every confidence not only tint he was a min of Btrong reli"ioua convictions but also a man of honour and of truth, and he would not therefore proceed on the supposition that the accusations or suspicions were true until they were actually proved He could not and would not without absolute proof believe them (Applause ) Ile supported Mr Harper 8 amendment because if they went to ti e commission after coming to a decision, their banda as a presbjtery would be tied, whereaB if matead of an appeal there was a simple reference to the higher court they would go up to the commission all having their votes Mr li R RniD Baid he was there is a lay man, at the unanimous request of the 1 Isternwick congregition It was his duty to isBure the preabytery that the 1 Isternwick Church and congregation had very earnestly watched the pamtul development of this question, and had come to the unanimous conclusion that it was not to the interest of the church that tina matter should be con tinued further their belief being that evil and not good would result if the matter were fought to the bitter end He most willingly joined with Mr Harper in giving the fullest credit to the ministers who thought it their dutj to brin^ the matter before the presbjterj He believed they had acted from the very highest motives but he must claim liberty of expression llielaj men of the Church in Victorm he had no hesitation in Baying, whatever opinions they might have had as to the wi«dom of the article in question being written had avery | Btrong feeling that great evil would result to the Church, and to the Mister w bom thej served, if this mattet were fought out as proposed As regarded the article in question, ho saw many reasons why it should not have been written and he failed to see any reason whj it ahould havo been written, but that was a very diflercnt thing from bringing the vvntT I before this presbytery in the face ot ChriBten dom, and conveying the impression that he was not a fall and lojal son of the church whoBC standards he signed in the face of day He waB much inclined to think that if the scruples of the biethren had been convejed to Mr Strong at the proper time m a proper way he would have taken an earlj opportunity of setting himself right with them It had been asserted, and not contradicted, that a eaucuB waa held, and that certain arrange ments were made to charge Mr Strong with -it would be out of order to say heresy-but arrangements were made whereby, in the face of the world, the inference was conveyed outside that Mr Strong had been guilty of something approaching hereBy In Ina (Mr Reid e) humble judgment there the first mis tal e was made Hie Reva Messrs Hamilton ind M Lachran elaborated something againat Mr Strong before the presbytery m speeches which were the reault of deep study and

Rev Mr Scott, which vvia full of a broad Christian spirit that would have delighted Dr Chai mers It ought to be lemembered that the church m which the Rev Air Strong preached had done a great work nia

com mittee Before giving those reasons he wished to sij solemnly that the aspersions which had been thrown upon the convener of the committee were without foundation He knew that no member of that committee was more anxious to further the work on bond than Mr Bl Macdonald He placed himself unreservedly in the hands of the committee ia to dates If there vvia anj obstruction or delay in that committco it wiia caused by him (Mr Hay) The committee unanimously found that the article m question did not contradict the standards, but they found aeveral things which thej considered required explanation Ho contended that unless the membcrB of tho committee were pre pared, on theso defective, ambiguous, and e\nggerated statements, to found a diatmct charge on which the preabytery could formu late a libel, they had no right to quoto ambi ginties If the committee had discovered any statement in tho article on which by a legitimate construction of it they could found a charge of unsouudneBS, thej would havo done bo and it would have been their duty to do it But tbey found no Btaterocnt which entitled them, to Bay the writer was guilty o unsoundneBB, and because they were not able to do that, in his opinion they were travelling bejond their instructions when they reported on what waa ambiguous, and seemed to them to require explanation There was no power to bring a charge against a man under euch circumstances, or to demand nn explanation from him If thero wero auch power ho could go to a minis ter a church-Bay to Mr M'Eachran a-take long notes, and then come to the preabytery and say he beard the minister pteaching wbat seemed to bo umbiguoua, that he (the mmiBter) seemed not to be clear about in epiration, that he seemed to have a mechani- cal view of the Atonement, and make other assertions, and so put the minister on the rack, and rum his reputation Now, the report hinted suspicion, and for that reason be differed from it As the committee went on with the framing of their report, he could not help thinking of the words of George M'Doriald's Bong " Ho s a' wrong, arid a' wrong, Anda' tho githcr ft' wrang, Tnero « nseihlng rieht about tho min, De »»' tho githcr »' wrang" (laughter), ] Hia consolation, however, waa that the committee might bo altogether wrong and not the writer of the article, and that feeling bad now grown into conviction Ho then contended that Mr Strong had merely written on historical Bketch of the viewB which had been held on the Atonement, and that he was not writing particularly of the views of the Presbyterian Church, or any other body on the doctrine With that view be (Mr Strong) had simply endeavoured to give a true history of the views which had een held 'Hie committee had not von tu'ed to eny the w riler had, in indirect or non categorical terms, contradicted tho standards of hiB church They were asked to find if ho had contradicted them, and had not found that he had done so, and could not find that he had done so Hie committee had found that there were gravo omissions in the article and that it entirely overlooked the sjinbolB of the churches-the creeds, articles confessions, and catechisms-which declared the doctrines in their moBt matured and articulate forma, and also that the writer overlooked the general agreement of Pro testant writers on tho subject Now, many of the ambiguities or omissions might have aneen, because certain things had not entered into the mind of the writer, and aa to not refer ring to the symbolic bookB, the writer might say they did not Bhow anything in any decree about what he wob treating-the de velopment of the doctrine If the writer did say that when questioned the preabytery could not make lum change his opinion or blame his logic Mr Strong had not put forth the article aa infallible, and it was not the huâmes" of the church to notice such omissions as were referred to in the report Aa to the remark in the report about not mentioning the general agreement of Protea taut wnterB on the Bubject, it wub a noton ous fact that Protestant writers were not agreed on the matter of the Atonement Al- though they generally admitted the fact o the Atonement being through the death o' Christ, there had been controversies as to whether Christ died for all men, or only tor the elect, and on other points It was true the Protestant churches had in cieaeed, but it would be simply false lor any writer giving an historical sketch of the doctrine, to say that Bince the time of the Reformation there had been a general union of opinion on the doe trine i ben Mr Strong had been blamed in the report for not showing that he dis eented from or repudiated the views of those whom ho had referred to, and he would challenge any member of the committee whether they did not mean to imply that, instead of dissenting from those viewa, they held that he believed in them (Hear, hear) Ihey had no right to throw out insinuations against each other, and far Ie«s had a committee of the church, after six weeks' consideration, to burl suspicions of that nature against a brother minister (Cheers ) It waa no part of Mr Strongs object in niB historic sketch to expresa Ina dissent or coincidence with the viewa he referred to, and it w as certain that he could not have held all of them, because Borae of them were opposed to others No 11 of the particulars of the report wa^ as follows - "14 With reference to the teaching of Kant Fiel le Schclhnc, and nef,el who arc termed 'tile I hlloeopheiB it ia bald 'their general

views ' Mr. Yu E said they made the statement in order to found No 1 finding on it Mr IJai continued, saying that the state mont of the writer of the article, that the teachings of various authorities

grosa materialism lhere was no man who bad received bia education during the past half century who had not had Ins theory of life moulded by the specu lotions of the men referred to, and wnen Mr Strong said they had had an mlluence, ho was Bimply stating a fact In Ina article Mr Strong gave a fair account of the doctrine of the Presby terian Church on the Atonement, and he did so without saying whether he dissented from or assented to that doctrine What he did about that doe trine he did about the others, and f the com mittee complained that when he gave ortho dox doctrine he did not Bay he was orthodox, surely they could not complain when he gave heterodox doctrine that he did not say he waa heterodox Did the presbytery think aman was going to be such a fool * (Laughter and dissent ) Well, they had all got their peou hnnties, and he was never offended when men pointed out Ina Somo men when beginning to sneak there, stroked their moutha, and others shook their shoulders He had Been men there shake their heads and one might almost Bee their ears shake (Laughter ) One man who had shaken his head bad actually Bhown in committee tha' he waa not aware of what the doctrine of Calvin was, and that waa a specimen of the men on the committee who criticised the article of Mr Strong (Laughter) The Rev Mr P\tte\ submitted that the speaker waa out of order and exceedingly oilensive in saying that a brother who did not know Calvinism waa a fair representative of the committee Mr un said that if he used the word " fair he would withdraw it The Rev D Pmsin asked if it waa fair for Mr Hay Bimply to introduce a lampoon on the personal appearance of the committee for that was what he was doing' Mr II vv continued -In particular No 7, the committee said Mr Strong used the expression "Atonement' as equivalent to " reconciliation Now, what harm could there bo in using the word in that sense' lhere was in this but little room for complaint, especially seeing that the word "Atonement was not used in their standards, and that in 12 out of the 13 times it was used in Scripture it was trans- lated "reconciliation ' No 8, which dealt with the statement that the "root and essence' of the doctrine were asserted to "ho in the rehgioua conaciousneaa of the Christian church caused a considerable amount of discussion in the committee, and some of the members said they would

miraculouB, but simply because they did no como legitimately within the scope of hia article Hie writer was treating of the growth of opinion in the church-about a fact which had como into her rehgioua con Bciousneaa He did not Boy aught about how that fact got into her consciousness, but, being there, he Bhowed how it had generated and developed lo havo dealt with the supernatural would have led him far beyond the scope of his article Ho (Mr Hay), al though he had known Mr Strong for 11 years, could not reveal what he knew of that gentleman's private belief, because it would liave no weight, but he had no doubt that Mr Strong, having assented as a minister of their church to their standards, and being an honeatman, would, if he really denied the Biipernatural.nolonger remain in theirchurch He had further no doubt that when he Baid, " Here ia a fact planted m the Christian con BciousneBB by the Bpintof God," he could bIbo BBy it grew there by the continual presence of the earrie spirit. He held, then, that the committee were not justified in the construction they bad put upon the phrase referred to, Moreover, u the committee had folien the trouble to inquire they would have found that Mr Strong was in harmony with the orthodox writers 'I he great opponent of the Tubingen school, Neander, said, "'Ino rehgiouB contenta of dogmatic phenomena lie m the very being of the Christian couBcioua ness, and only by means of it can thia development be rightly understood Here then, waa an orthodox writer, whee mission it waa to uphold the supernatural, using language exactly similar to that Uhed by Mr Strong, and thus it inevitably followed that a writer could useBueh language without wri' mgfrom the standpoint of thoae wbo denied the supernatural or miraculous facts of the scriptures lîesidea, what could the religious consciousness of the Christian Church be but the spirit of Christ in the church ' It must be eo, or they were driven to the conclusion that the Christian Church had been formed outside the spirit of Christ, which spirit was the spirit of God In reference to the state ment about the different doctrine in the Sjnoptist Apocilypae and in the Epistles of James and Peter, on which was founded the serious charge that Mr Strong seemed to deny the infallible truth of the scriptures it was not out of place to remind the presbj terj that several members of the committee had dissented from the view Btated in the report, and were inclined to Bay that "different doctrine simply meant a diflerent form of presenting the aame truth The languago, without making a great demand on their charity or intelligence, could bear that construction, and seeing that it waa so, Burelj it would have been more kind to put that construction upon it rather than to rear such a charge on so llimsj a foundation But BuppoBmg the committee a conatruction to bo right, the conclusion come to did not in anj degree follow, becatiBO "diflerent doctrine was not the same as "contradictorj doctrine ' Ero ti is conclusion could logically follow, the word " contradictory or something equi valent, would have had to be in the article As an illustration, showing how " diflerent was not "contradictory, would Mr M Eachran ely that the idea of God given m the Old Testament was the Bame aa that given in the New , or, if different, would he Bay that it waa "contradictorj Tor theBe two reasons, then, the Berioua charge fell to the ground Surelj, moreover, different accounts of events in the life of Chriat-a phrase tiEed bj Mr M'Eachran himself-was, from Mr Mlichrans standpoint, quite aa incompatible with the infallible truth of Scripture as the expression "different doctrine and to notice the difference be tween Paul and James was surely not lesa offensive than to notice the diflerent accounts of the LaBt Supper in the gospels In par ticular No 10 the committee Bald the dif ference between John and Paul was exag gerated by Mr Strong Let it bo noticed here that the committee admitted that there was a difference The question was then one of degree But ere they could underatand the value of the committee s opinion the j reabj terj should be informed that one member said that the difference alleged did not exist in Scripture Rev Mr Haiidie denied that any Buch Btitement bad been made in committee Mr II vi waa under the impression that a motion was submitted to the effect that Mr Slrong had failed to establish his position and that the difference referred to did not exist in Scripture However, the question was now only one of degree, and he would ask who waa to settle the degree of difference The church stand iras had not settled it Would those men, then, who had noted that the difference was exaggerated by Mr Strong, be kind enough to stute the degree, or were thej to leave the presbjtery in uncertaintj ' Supposing thej did tell the exact degree, he did not suppose that the church in all time would adopt their opinion and certainly m the present church he would not (Applause ) Cut in opposi tion to them, he would point to authorities such as V estcott and Godet who had empha siEcd the diflerences as Mr Strong had done, md who were nevertheless looked upon as most orthodox writers Mr Macdonald he thought, in Ina speech had quoted the number of times in which certain vvorda were uBed bj two authors-Paul and John Mr Macdonald -No, that was m the committee Mr Haï -However, the question waa not whether two men used the Bame words but whether their tjpe of thought wus the same, and all authorities admitted that their tj pe of thought was diflerent I hey should further mark that Mr Strong emphasised the fact that thej were the same inspirit}-that men were reconciled to God m one wa), and that beneath the diflerences there was a unity of the spirit There waa then a dif ference- i diflerence admitted bj greatermen thananjone on the committee, and surely Mr Strong could not be blamed for noting it No 11 waa a long and very peculiar linding It referred to the account given bj Mr Strong of the doctrines held bj the I athera being one Bided and defective Now Mr Strong did not profeas to hive reid the Eathers in the original, nor even m the translations He gave, however, his authorities in footnotes, and before the presbv terj could come to an un prejudiced decision they would have to look up and read Mr Strong a authontiea andaolearu if he had given a correct representation of their views Now, he (Mr Haj) knew that one bnlf of the court had not read these authorities, and ho doubted if all the mern bera of the committee had read them The reading of them, however, ought to bo attended to as a point of honour Now, re- garding the paragraph the committee had noted there was this singular thing, that it was the only one on which Mr Strong had given an explanation When Mr Rentoul waa giving substantially the view expressed in the finding, Mr Strong corrected bun, and drew his attention to the fact that his (Mr Strongs) statement was a comparative one Mr Strong did not denj that the writers re ferret! to laid emphasis on the death of Christ, bnt simply said that they did not laj euch emphaaia on it aB was done in later theologj If the committee had remembered Mr Strongs explanation, and read Ina lan guage aa it was entitled to be read, they would not have come to their finding With regard to the committee's criticism on Origen as opposed to Mr Strong, he might remark that Origen a theory appeared grotesque now, but that it was not so to Origen or to the Christians of the first teu centurieB Origen certainly did not hold the propitiation of God m the sense that Mr M Lachran and Ina friends did Mr M'Eachran waa at pains to prove that Origen held the present orthodox theory, and he translated a passage from that writer s commentary on the Romans It was singular that ho could only find one pa83age in that commentary to suit his argument Moreover, Mr M Lachran forgot that fine tenso of charitj and justice for which ho waa noted in dealing with this matter, for he failed to quote the whole passage Mr M'LACimw-Oh j es, I did-every word Mr Hay -Did j on take

but he did wrong once and wo got free Mr Strong did not deny that somo of the writers held a higher idea than Origen What he did say waa that men did not lav so much emphasis on it aa m later theology But Mr Strong was quoting authorities, and they had no right to mamu ato that he had distorted his authorities for aparticular purpose Let them grant that Mr Strong gave a true synopsis aa far as ho read, and there the matter might end Could anyone think that thiB presbytery waa capable of deciding fairly whether Mr Strong had exaggerated the difference between Paul and John. Ho said it was out of placo to ask this presbytery to decide on such questions, and he thougbt tbe committee were not called upon to notice them m the report. It waa observable that the committee passed over live pages of the article ia which they found nothing worthy of quoting, these pages giving the doctrine of Luther and Calvin As to Mr Strongs 4th leaBon the committee had a great deal of difficulty in coming to a finding Hie finding WB8 that the word " spirit' was used as sub- jective feeling ot indefinite sentiment He asked who ever ueed ' spirit' in tint sense' No man of education certainly over so used it Mr strong certainly did not so U8e it What did we mean when we Baid 'God is Spirit' W ib it not that objective reality which underlay «11 the forniB m which Ile _ othed Iïiiii«elf or in which we could think of Iliro Mr Strong used "Bl mt here as the only otjec'ive reality We must all admit that our rcli"iou had had many forms but me oljcctive sprit bad been working in mid through nil these forms. Was not tina one epirit really a very definite thing which mudo all our forms of any v lue and waa working in every ChriBti m and m all churches ' We might hive imy form of doctrine or of worship we

how could the committee think bo, when he said that wo must seek the truest intellectual forma into which to cast our faith ' What was seeking the truest intellectual form into which to cast our faith, but an earnest endeavour to get tho moBt definite statement of doctrine ' Would any man in this church Bay that they had got he most ) erfect intellectual form into which to set their faith' No

them all men in all ages sought anew to forn ulate their faith ltio con- tinual endeavour todo so only proved moro clearly that the Bpirit of our religion waa greater than all forms In this particular the committee through either ignoranco or prejudice or a desire to fix a charge on Mr Strong had gone a0uinst tho plain reading of tho mana own words About No 10, tho preabytery would bo pleased to learn that four members of tho committee dissented 1 hey justly considered that Mr Strong a using the word 'even indi cated that he did not put the apostle on the some footing us other men, and he did tlnnl it would be not asking the presbytery too much to imagine that Mr Strong would not in euch on oil hand way Beek to sub- vert the authority of Scripture But to make this clearer, notice the connexion m which the words were UBcd Hie writer was Becking to show that in theology as in everything else unity of spirit not uniformity, was the law of life He waa wishing to point out unity amid diversity, and in order to emphasise his point, be showed that we could not all feel mid think like Irena.ua or Origen, Luther or Calvin He endeavours to strengthen his point by saying that we could not all think even ia John, or JunieB, or Paul He waa not Baying a word about the in- fallibility inspiration, or authority He waa simply wiblnng to show that there waa a unity of Bpirit independent of all forms, and they could admit this surely when they considered the simple fact that if the apostles had lived now a days the form of their teaching woulj hive been changed to Bint us, as Paul changed it huuaelf to ault Greek, or lîomau, or Jew, without m any way im- pugning bia apoBtolic authority Now he carne to point 17, which noticed that the articles savoured of Pantheism Hie writer vvns giving Grotius asan instance of a man tv ho pressed the word "ruler too far justas Origen had preeecd the word ' ranBom , be- cause Grotius broke away from the Cal v mistic idea of God aa an absoluto ruler, whose will and thought were one, and took the idea that God swill aa known in Hie world by ua that waa merely no necessary expres- sion of his character In thus condemning the error of Crotius aa to God being a ruler, he was by implication agreeing with Calvin, because those were tho only two ideas of ruler-the arbitrary and absolute Could they not have thought that tina was the in tention.and not to deny the personality o£ God , and were they to sanction this interpo- lation of the words when we could find in Scripture DU phrnaes more pantheistic ' But would they buy that he was outside of ua, as oie man was outsidn of another' Was not God in inspiration and re"eueration in us mid v e in him not outside of us aa one mania outside of another' Coming to No l8 he drew attention to the laBt c1 mse that the related ideas of God as a moral governor and moral law seem to be left out and y et they found in the passage Buch phrases us the moral hell lcBBneas of man in himself, surely implying that man could only have mont strength in another Wo had the curso of darkness and light of aelfiuhncBa and perfect love, that love being God Surely we could not have perfect love without perfect righteousness and perfect morality surely tho curse which perfect love put on selliahiieäd or sin waB a just thing ni the universal cxprej Bionof God Bhighcstrighteousneaa and justice After that, surely it was impossible to say that God aB a moral governor waa not spoken of but the subaututionary sacrifice of Christ was left out Mr Strong vviahed to mention the essential
