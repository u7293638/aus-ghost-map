\- -hOW A GOOD SHIP WAS LOST Oni tile night of October 27th, 11S2, the good ship "Mory Comlptorx," of Brisot, Enghnd, was st-uggling with a fesrifl gale ott the coast of North America. The wind blew furiously, but the wathler ?as clear, and the Captain expectet every moment to get sight of the light is the lighthouse on the Iron Reck Shols. This liehthouse mirkiel the entrance to the lsmrouor. Once there, and they were safe. Five minutes later the ship struck with a feolrul shock and went to pi:ces.
