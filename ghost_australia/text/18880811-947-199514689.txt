Barton was busily engaged in subposnaing a jury. The .coroner. arrived at midday and the enquiry was at once . commenced. -The doctor having .deposed to the nature of the injuries which caused death, and various witnesses having given - thoir evidence, Barton's turn came.- He doposod to having made minute enquiriei in many quarters as to the' habits of the deoeabed ? — his usual ? time ' for' leaving' school — the manner, in , which he usually ?pent]' his evenings— aqd' whether his auHUueta iruiu um iuu^iui^v Yfiiat ,uu un common {occurrence.': H» was ' informed that though the deceased was sometimes very late in coming home, his landlady had -never known him to stay away all night,, unless he had gone to the town ship, where ha usually stopped with his friend Thorn wait*. Barton add«d that he had then made partioulVc enquiries as to who the murdered man had been seen with last, and hera he was completely baffled: No one had seen him in anyone's company after the children had left school. The scholars all agreed that they had left: him, sitting at his desk writing. Pursuing his enquiries, however, he was informed by one of the witnesses, Mr. Ptevena, who had found the body, that Mr. Gilbert West, who had conimenoad the search for the deceased, had stated to Mr. Stevens that he had been with Mr. Fletcher about 9 o'clock at night, that the deceased tab in an excited state, and ' that wishing to transact Borne . business with Mr. Fletcher, he (Gilbert- Wwt) had gone over to the school the morning after ho had interviewed him.. -Barton went on to state that while at Gilbert's house the search party had found the corpse; and that Gilbert West had acoompanied him (Barton) to the spot where the dis covery had' bean made.

'Yes — there were angry words passed be tween us ; the first angry words that either of us ever spoke to each other from the ho»r when we first became friends, seven years ago.' The grey eyes of the legal man glittered,' and a ghost of a smile played about the corners of his thin lips. : 'I thank you for the candour of your reply, Mr. West ; and in pursuing this enquiry I must ' do myself the justice to,. s»y that I regret the nature of the ques tion I am about to put to you— but I have no option.

Gilbert felt the ground cleaving beneath jhis feet— felt his brain vwhirl — coroner, witnesses, lawyer, j all blurred and ? revolv ing in a dembnlao' dance before his be wildared gaze. Hia tongue clave: to the root of hia mouth— his lip» raor«d,but no words escaped thorn. Hia sympathotio pr6seoutor blandly repoated his question. Then by a mighty effort Gilbert composed himself and replied. -?. ? ' Yes ; wo closed and fought a few rounds ; fought until out of breath in fact, and then each went his way, I to my home ond Tom in the direction of his.' 'Did you miss any portion of your clothing when you arrived at homo 1' 'Clothing 1' answered Gilbert j 'not that I am aware of, unless it was my hat. lam not auro that I had my hat on when I reached homo, I was too muoh excited and grieved to be Hire about anything.' .'Is the hat produced in court your property?' Barton held a hat in front of Gilbert. 'That is my hat,' answered the poor fellow shuddering as he saw the Btaina of poor Tom's blood upon it. . .' Ono more question and I have done, ' laid the lawyer, with a smirk of satis faction at the evident conclusion to whioh all tha proceedings were tending. ' You were one of those who auisted to osrry the corps* of your friend from; the spot where it was found, were you not ! ' ';Yei.';. ?- ,?? .''??;?',?? / ' 'Was it on that spot that you fought 1' \ ;-. ' No ; about ? hundred yards from it, just at the turn where the cross-road leads ,tq,Mr. SuflTa farm.' ... ? : 'I have no more quostions to ask this witness,!' observed the man^of words, and the court was thereupon bleared. The coroner, summed up , the - evidenoe, put ting the case clearly and . forcibly, but unfavourably to GilberV before the jury. They were men. for the mo»t part un lonerou ; nousii. m i-iio oounu in wuiuu the word is used by th«: community at large, but 'quite inoapable of that nice discernment which.was essential to enable' them 'to arrive at a correct conclusion. Unfortunately for (Jubert,'one of ? the jury' was not disposed to be friendly towards him, though he would have' indignantly resented the '; charge of eumity. This juror was- a keen dealer, and Gilbert's stubborn -honesty was' a' standing reproach to him, inasmuch as he was a constant attendant at the little Methodist chapel, always put a coin of considerable value in the plate, and discoursed fluently about the necessity for , everyone to have .-' a new heart.' Gilbert had had but two transactions with ..him, in both- of which Gilbert had beon i worsted.. The last time Gilbert did .not -hesitate to tell : hia sanctimonious neighbour that he had cheated him. aud that the characteristic of a just man aB stated by the Psalmist waa that though .

' . ?.'.'? l ?;' ' '.Well, you Bee; Mr.; West, there was no paper passed between us ; and if you 'go .to court it's only your word against nay w.ord.' The smile of triumphant rascality which accompanied this speech thoroughly angered Gilbert, who told him disdain fully that he supposed he had been deal-1 ring . with .an ' honest- .man whose word' would have been aB good as his bond: - ; { The modern Jacob turned away with ( angry gesture, and the next Sunday put a! sovereign into ..the plate instead of his .usual-, half-crown-;' but.

Wall, it's a bad business, but we've got to do our duty, and that's to return a. verdict of wilful murder against Gilbert West' . . , - There was a demur on the part of two of the jurymen, who- hall some vague notions about the case being one of man slaughter rather .than murder, but they were losing a day's work, and the inquest, was a disagreeable business, l«nd Juoot- knew more about these things than they did, and therefore they 'coincided. In a few more minutes Gilbert was made con-' soious of his- terrible position by finding his hands'fettered and .Barton walking at his side, after yolunteerlug thq informs. ti6nv''Yo'uare'n»y prisonor, Mr. 'W«Bti'i ,in his bed of sioknees— a sickneaa which proved to be unto death. Christine and her mothor watched and waited alternately, and the former was thus kept in ignorance of what had transpired until Gilbort had been hurried off to gaol. Loving her father devotedly, and wearied by her incessant oares and labours in the sick ohamber, the news that poor Tom had come to an untimely end fell more lightly upon her bewildered Bonses than it would otherwise have done. Indeed she scarcely comprehended that crime had brought about the catastrophe, until Mr. Kennedy returned from the inquest completely overwhelmed by the revela tion of Gilbert's share in that event. ' 'You are ill, exhausted. Mr. Ken nedy. Let me bring you a little refresh ment,' said Christine, looking at the pale face and troubled eyes ef her usually cheerful and chatty old friend. 'My dear Miss La Roche,' replied the kind-hearted old man, 'your poor father is ill, very, very ill. I regard you as fatherless, and I once had a daughter ?o like to you that I feel the father stir in my heart when I apeak to you. Will you let me- take the place of him who -is so near the spirit land that the things of earth neither -grieve nor interest him ? .Never assuredly did you want an expe rienced head and a kind heart to aid you as you. do now.' ....... , ....... ' Dear Mr. Kennedy, you have always been the kindest, best- of friends; but why do* you* say I want an experienced and kind guide now ?*'-._ ... -. : ' Your friend, your more than friend Gilbert West, has been arrested for the wilful murder of Thomas Fletcher.' . '-, - ? Christine's naturally pale .face grew' paler, her lipa twitched, her eyes dilated. The old man took her outstretched hands in his and drew her' close to him. ',' My child, it is very. terrible, but God will put all things right. Wa must. do all that man can do to enable Mr. WeatJio clear himself if he can.?' ? 'If ho can t' exclaimed Christine, a flash of. her dark eyes amphasiag the words with her full connection that to doubt the possibility of his doing so was to harbour an absurdly reasonable thought. . .': -i '' ' r well, well, my dear young, laay, you are quite right no doubt ; but as I don't know' bo much about Mr. Weat as you do, I must take snoh steps (-vith;ypur per mission) as wiirensure justioe being done. The evidence at the inquest went terribly againnt your friend ; though his manly, straightforward explanation would carry conviction or ma innocence to. anyone, who knew him as well as you do Unfor tunately the law knowa nothing about him or you or anybody.

'Ap- pearances aro ull againBt Gilbert ; his bruised faco was the rosult ef that -encounter. He was with. Tom— he quarrelled, he fought.
