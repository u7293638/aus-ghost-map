Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, Bat greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine; Bat the man who fails and yet still fights on, Lo, he is the twin-born brother of mine.
