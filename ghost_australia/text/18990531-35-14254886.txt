further endowment of the Bathurst Diocesan Society That contributions to this fund be spread over the years, 1899 1903 and 1901, and that it he suggested that during that period of three years amounts varying from £0 to 6s be solicited from every member of the Church of T- ngl and in the d10 case" The Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge had promised £500, conditional on the collection of £100 for the above object by 1902 The motion was seconded by the Hon G H Cox, and carried A subscription list was opened in the room this evening the synod was continued in the church The Bishop delivered his address THE BISHOP'S ADDRESS The Bishop commenced his address by pointing out that living as we did in stirring times, he felt it was the bounden duty of a bishop to endeavour to the very best of manpower and ability, not merely to uphold the rightful position of his Church, but to instruct its members in their duties, privileges, and ici>pousilnhties, and thus stimulate them to fresh left port and more earnest sal He therefore proposed first of all to deal with the two words, Catholic and Protestant in heating of the first he referred to its earliest use, add TO (according to Bishop Light- foot as an epithet of the Church, by S Ignatius, in the Epistle to the Smvriiamns It also occurs in the Maitynlom of Polycarp and 115, and was used by Justin Martyr The Bishop made reference to its other uses in several centuries, and noted how religious bodies valued it, but he said " We must he quite sure that we use it rightly Vi hat S Ignatius meant by the Catholic Church is quite clear He defined and described it and there is no evading the force of his words We have seen how the word gradually passed through various stages in the course of centuries, from an adjective to a substantive, now taken sometimes to describe the individual and sometimes the Church, but its the thing and significance is throughout the shire The Holy Sacrament of Baptism, duly and properly administered, matter' and words,' to , water and the invocation of the Sacred Trinity being used makes a man, through the operation of the Holy Ghost, a Catholic Even lay baptism, in case of necessity, is recognised as a valid baptism This has been three times argued and decided! before and by the Ecclesiastical Courts in the present century, but in Philhmoro's ' Book of Church Liw' the following caution is given * Lay baptism should only be resorted tom great extremity when the sacrament is administered by one who is not ordained, without such necessity, the person baptisms guilty of no small she, went through His act may bring a blessing to the person baptiSed His act cannot he undone, but it ought not to have been done' But the act l", if all conditions are complied with a valid one and the individual baptised is a Catholic being thus transplanted into the mystical body of Christ, which is His Church But our Church requires, in non-emergency cases be fore baptism, certain conditions, repentance and faith in the individual, as stated in the Catechism in conformity with what is found in the Acts of the Apostles and to ensure this, in the case of infants, sponsors are appointed who are answerable to the Church and thus as S Augustine puts it (Aug Fpist xxiii, quoted by Bingham) ' Children were presented to baptism, not so much by those in whose hands they were brought (though by them, too, if they were good and faithful men is by the whole Society of boots The whole Church was their mother she brought forth fire and everyone by this item bath ' thus the most careful provision was made for the nurture and maintenance of this Catholicity in the Body which S Ignatius calls 'the Catholic Church,' for even in adult baptism His Church looks for the presence of spin sors, although the adult answers for himself, and she expects confirmation to follow as soon ' as conveniently as ly be,' and thou Holy Communion and other ordinances and whilst, therefore, baptism admits into the Catholic Church, the maintenance and nurtured Cathu city is equally access by rail is fully provided for by the Church to which the faithful churchman "and his loving obedience, lecog arising burnell (although he is careful to pass no judgment upon others) that this is the way by means of which his obedience is perfect 1, and thus becomes obedience to and communion with the great Head of the Church, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, the four of ange of Catholicity" the next world he referred to was Protestant the actual antithesis of which, he said is Paris It is curious, however, to notice that, whilst the Lord Keeper Bacon in his address dealt ere 1 January 25, 1 59, to both Houses of Parliament in the presence of Queen Elizabeth, said no such words as heretic, schismatic, papist ' was in future to be used, how little this was adhered to, for in long-, in the now I Purl ment., it is stated by the Speaker that her M Most), as defender of the faith, will aid and main him all good Protestants to the discouraging of all Papists " So, too James 1 in 1604 admonishes the Papists of this land ' The word itself is an old one, as it occurs in the Vulgate, 2 Chron , xxii , 10, ques protestantes like adding celebrant,' 1 of the prophets who protested against the idolatrous of Judah and Jerusalem were thus early) designated 4 protestants ' This word, I need hardly say, is denied from two Latin words pro, openly tested i, to bear witness It came into use soon after the year 1936 (about three years), when the Diet of St lies passed decrees favourable to Lutheranism, but three years after this, he 1 29, at another Diet the Emperor revoked these decrees there upon the Lutl crans entered a formal protest against the Emperor's other, and thus obtained the name of Protestants In 10/0 the King and He would defend with his life both the Protestant religion and the laws of his kingdom ' James his us to his Privy Council, and also repeals the Parliament, that he will defend and support the principle the Church of England ' but this solemn assurance is soon forgotten One art, however, quickly followed upon another of the infatuated lung in favour of the Roman Catholic religion, until at last Archbishop Sancroft and six bishops of the Church of Copland me committed to the lower, and on June 29, 1688, placed as criminals at the bar of the King's Bondi The heart of old England was then stirred to its very depths, and when the wards ' IN of guilty' were littered, they poured forth from one end of the country to the other, and before the end of the year James II was a fugitive and William of Orange ultimately declared King And now comes in a curious and often forgotten feature in the history of the word Protestant ' In his address as Prince he du each the two Houses of Parliament tone are such was as they may deem necessary for the security and maintenance of the Protestant religion and such as in 1 establish a good agree that between the Church of England and Protestant dissenters I He states that his solo design is the presentation of the Protestant religion' On March 25 1689 a committee was appointed to inspect the coronation oath and in it were inserted these n ords 'Mill you, to the ill most of your power, maintain the hand of God, the into profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant reformed religion as by law established ? ' Since that time, the expression has, Hilarious Acts of Parliament, been applied to the Church of Lowland But how did the Church of England hor^clfuct^ On December 1, in the same year when both Houses of Convocation were sitting (in united synod) in King Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, the Earl of Nottingham brought down a Royal license and message from the King in the reply, the Upper House i e the bishops headed by Compton, Bishop of London (commonly called the ' Protestant Bishop ') desired to add the designation ,' Protestant to the Church of England, to which the Lower House demurred, and finally expunged the word, saying that the term mis ' equivocal, since Socinmns, Anabaptists, mid Quakers assumed the title and that town the Church has never applied to herself in any official document Search carefully through the Prayer Book, Services, save and except the Coronation Oath, Homilies Articles, and you nowhere find the word, and wisely has our Church acted The form of the oath of William and Mary are retained to this day, but at the investiture of the tug these words are used ' Receive this ring, the ensign of kingly dignity and of defence of the Catholic faith be one expression may help to interpret the other in that service Nott, in what light are we to new This world 'Protestant?' Aio were despise and reject it 1 It is not, as no time seen, a word the Church of England claims for herself, although applied to it in Acts of Parliament But for all that we are fully prepared to recognise its value From 1903 to 1688 the two opposing terms in controversy were Papist and Protestant, Willi These the literature of that period teemed , nay, for many generations after the publication of the Papal Bull (April 27, 1570)nhor0bj the Church of Rome was withdrawn from communion with the national Church of England, the words were controversial regarded as representing two parties in the Catholic Church the word Protestant is not a Bible word (if it of except that quotation from the Vulgate) any more than the word Catholic is, and it is, in its general use a much more modern void HOad against 1 2r) (we are, of course, omitting the Vul- gate) but it is writ large, as no hare seat, in the Parliamentary records of the Church of England " The Bishop next proceeded to show that whilst the Church of England did not claim for herself the title of Protestant, she did look upon herself as Catholic, and in proof of this refers to the Book of Common Prayer He then proceeded to show that the charge is well founded, and referred to Acts ii 41 for the definition of Catholicity As to the Apostles' doctrine " lins," the Bishop said, "we distinctly assert the Church of England, as the tests at consol matrix ' (witness and keeper) hits faithfully maintained 1 tie men of fact that she has retained the three great creeds, and requires them to be recited in her services, is sufficient evidence Add to this the baptismal service, the visitation of the sick, the solemn questions addressed to the de leon or he is advanced to the priesthood all alike testify to this " The fellowship of the Apostles was next referred to, and then " the breaking, of bread " and " the prayers, on all which points the Catholicity the Church of England was quite clear The Bishop then said, in reference to the present position of the Church at home, that since the Church of England was pre-eminently Catholic, and in its attitude Protestant, how is it that the present difficulties exist ? For his part, he thought the failure at home was want of discipline most difficult to exercise, in connection with the State He believed that ere long the difficulties would vanish, and the Church come out of this ordeal strengthened, purified, and enlarged the rest of the Bishop's address had reference chiefly to diocesan matters He said the diocese was free from any Romanising tendencies on the part of the clergy But whilst the clergy was free from all such Romanising tendencies, and manifested no inclinations towards excess in ritual, he was afraid that cases of defect of ritual and non-compliance with the regulations of the Prayer Book existed Those had not come (before him officially, and therefore he trusted this intimation would suffice The Bishop said that 34 confirmation had been held in the year, and 713 psrsonB confirmed Referring to St Augustine College, Canterbury, the Bishop said the diocese already owed a debt of gratitude to that college Speaking of the diocese generally, it appeared to him ob vigorous and as full of energy as ever
