THE VICTORIAN EACLJO C URmY&L.; THE MELBOUIiSE CUT. VIGTCJRY OF OARBF5S MUSKET'S (ML.LANT X ANOTHER RL0ORD E3TAIiLI5LIiij. A POPULAR WIN CHEERING BEARD BKVtjXry T-I-; RLV.KR. [By Te!o,<ra:)ti) [From oar Speaial Kipor;ar ,. Me'boame, N. v-imtar J. ibe riohesfc stake eres offered by any club in the world was to day carried otf by ia» greatest racehorse ever foaled in the ^matimra hemisphere, by the champion of all champion* -Oarbine, When spoken of, historically, tha Melbourne Dap cf 1890 will be alluded to ia the same terms an is the memor&b;!') victory of Eclipae, " Oarbine firRt and the rest nowhere,'' All the ordinary aVaa lations aa to time and weight hava bwu capaized to-day, and Mr. Barnard ia b_ja^ blamed for not having put another at'ma an the gallant eon ot Musket and Mersey to brtnjr him back to hiB field, This victory is certainly the most marvellous ever known, for it waa not a classic event in which he had to carry weUht for Bge, bnt a two milea handioap for £IQ,>K)0 in which he as top weight bad the impost of a Etone more than hia weight for age. Cvr bine had to meet the beat cattle ia Australia that could be brought ag»iu*t him, acd . yet he won apparently in a hand _ oanter by nearly three leoattn in the quiokeBt time ever recorded at Flemiiu ton. It ia no wonder then that the asaemblai thousat>d3 who witnessed the event o4a«ad themaelveB hoarse, and had he not been an animal who could make use of hia beela they would have oarried the viotor baok to tha saddling paddock. Never waa there saoli » Melbourne Gup winner before. Malaa and Commotion were the heroes of their day, bat Oarbine has done more than either of these, and won the public money in the moat brilliant fabhion ntder conditions to which no otbsr botBe was ever subjected, His owner and hi« jockey had their tail share of the enthaaiaatia storm of applause, and Oarbine himself seerr.ed proud of his achievement when brought up to the stewards' box. While Mr, Wallace was btirg awarded the handaome silver trophy which is addtd to the stake, Carbine friakad around liliea two jear-old, and seemed ready enough to run another two mile race if required, starting into a smart trot on being led towards the loose boxes. If it were any othac race than the Melbourne Gup a writer would be disposed to Bum the matter up in very faw worda by saying that Oarbine waited upaa to a other horses until he waa wanted to go to tha front, when he went np and took fitat position, and oautered home at hia ease. Saab, however, was not tbe exact oonditian of affairs, as hia rider Kammage haa acknow ledged, for on being interviewed after the race he eaid he rode the h»r»a all he knew, and took every ounoe he could out of him till he got Carbine's head in front, neating the stand, and that he had to fl ig him to make him extend himself, and that had he dropped hiB whip the acaident would have aoat hiB owner £10,000. It was not by any mean* the easy victory that it looked, bnt Carbine is such a perfect animal that his action ia most de ceptive, and while cutting a record and oarryinc: a top weight he appears to be scaroely exertion himself. The acoount of tbe rnnning as given below Bhowa that the pace waa made very warm from the start by Tarooola, Tne Spot, Whimbrel, Gatling, and Enuc] successively* with Meloa always in a dangerous position, and it was of this old rival of Oarbine that Haw age waa moat afraid. He Btatea that he did not care for either of the others, but alwaje kept an eye on Meloa, who was in front of him right up to the distance post. He had been Blightly blocked in tbe early part of tha race, and had to fall baok seventh or eighth, whereas hia intention waa to never be farther away than fourth from whatever waa in the van. Bnt when the pace and the diatance told its tale on those in the ruck fUmmage waa enabled to get Oarbine np aa they rounded the turn, where, however, he had to oome on tha outbide. Then being challenged by Ma'tn be beat bim off. and Enuo, Highborn, The Admiral, Gorreze, and all thaaa who were nearest at the turn had to be oonteat to eee the champion sail away to the front, certainly with every muaole on the stretoh bat with courage and temper unwavering respond ing to the calls of hia rider in tbe gallanteat fashion, and improving his poaition atride by stride, bo that the further he went the mora he gained upon them until he passed tha post nearly three length* in front of tha bis nparest attendant, and won for hiB owner a stake worth £.0,000, irrespective of soma £30,000 in wagers. Carbine's total winnings are now £25,500, or doable the largest amonat ever won by any other horse in Australia. Highborn, the second horse, who won £2.000, was well thought of until he was beaten in a mile race last week at Elsternwiok Park. Ha was owned bb a youngster in Sydney by Mr. G. E. Kennedy, who has relatives in Adelaide, and who either gave him away or sold him lor a ecng to make room for Aberdeen, Prtot, and other horses, In his ataole Highborn haa ehown such good form to his present owner that be believed he had almost a mortgage rn the Cnp, and one bookmaker at ths Viotorian Olcb on Monday night informed ma tbat be had baoked Highborn to win him £45.0D0, and was lamenting that he conld not lay off even thousands to 20. Had anything happened to Carbine Highborn would hava been another Zulu, although Correza can leally well and finished third, thereby winning £1,000. It is n)t oevfeua that MeloB could not have got a plaoa bad hia rider persevered with him | but whea Carbine pasaed them, and the shouta of tha populace told tbe various riders that Garbiaa waa in the front, tbeir hopes were extinguished, and only the few who were aotually close up continued to persevere Enuc ran a good game or.lt, and Tbe Admiral, who wa3 conceding 6 lb. to Corrfzn, was a very good fifth, and Chaldean was well up, sixth. Vengeanca waa undoubtedly interfered with to anoh 4a extent that his chances were destroyed. Hi* rider states that round by the riveraida bU mount was knocked right over, but by whom be did not oare to say. Again by the abattoir* alter making up his leeway and while goin< very well, Vengeance was a second tima knocktd out of hia stride. It ia certain that a number of horses were Btarted in the interests of the aweepholdera who had not the ghost of a obance in the race, bat who might eacily by accident or otherwise get ia the way of a favorite, Vengeance had givea such satisfaction to his owner and trainer in * trial that ha was not only backed for heavier amounts than any other horse in tha caoa on Monday at tha dub bat was also baoked to day by the public in the paddook until hia prioe oama to 6 to 1, or within two points ot that of Oarbine, His bad fortana in the raoe afforded another illustration of tha glorious uncertainties of the tnrf. Bert Holmes, who steered Enuo, Baid tbat he made the pica a craoker as long aa ever he ooqld with Gnirasaier, They Bnoceeded admirably, as tha first mile and a half was cnt ont in 3 mi a, S3 eeo , the last mile in 1 min. 41£ sec.; and tha last six furlongs in 1 min. 17$ sea., the tima for the two miles being 3 min. 28$ seo. The field for the Cap to day ia the beat oa record, the next highest number being 35, when Sheet Anohor won in 1885, and 83 ia 1ST6, when Briseis got home, and in the follow ing j sar when Cheater won, aa also is 1331 when Zulu waa the first past the post. Althongh the Melbourne Onp of 1890 haa beaa a splendid bettting raoe, the books must hava ail lost over Carbine's victory, aa he haa beaa consistently supported from the tima tha weiahta came oat, and waa ooupled heavily in doubleB with Vengeanoe for the CauifieJd Cup, and The Admiral fei the Derby, besides being baoked for a lot of money for a place, Tha other events of tha day sink into comparative insignificance beaida the Cop, bet tbe double viotory of Teksamin tee Railway Handicap and tha Yan Yaaa Stakes is deserving of epeoial mention, as ha ran a very brilliant horse in both events. Tekasm i3 Musket read backwards. It will thus be seen that he ia by the aama aire aa Carbine, bnt ont of Albatross instead ot Merny, The Kensington Stakes were appro priated by The Baron, a son of Neokersgat Ursula, bnt Mr. Wilson could get no nearer tnaa third in the Nursery Stakea with hia repra een*ative Steadfast.1 Tommy Corrigau'a victory on Freedom in the Hurdle Kace was bb usual * popular win, the pnblio aa a role backing thia tide* irrespective of hia mount. The attendaaoa at the Cop Day was _ something enornnaa, locomotion being simply impossible. Tbepreu representatives who were sending reports from the upper stand had to remain there, and depend upon their colleagues for paiticalara aa to betting, &o.;, until thay had time later on to verify their laoU aad figurea. It reminded one of tha old country to see tta governors'rquipayea tooled by powdered an J bewiggtd postilions instead of ooachma*.

The favorite was now closing tip on the leaders, bat Eouo hell his lead into the straight, where The Admiral oame up strongly and got into Becond positho3 CoirasBier for a while looking dangerous in third place, and CIOBO up were Highborn, Meloe, Carbine, Carrez?, and Sir William, At the distance poet the rase suddenly assumed an altogether different aapeot, as R»mage calling upon Carbine brought the champion oat from hia horses on the wbip hand, and setting sail in a determined fashion deliberately crossed over to the rails more than a olear length in frost of everything eke, and then sat down to ride home for dear life using the whalebone judiciously and extracting every ounce out of hia horse. Carbine answered most gallantly and drew away from his pursuers at every stride, not with the ease that most people|imagined bat with every nerve and muscle at its highest pitch of tension. His old opponent Meloa tried bard and desperately to get near him bat without avMS, and the pace simply killed the majority of the horBCB except the light- weighted Highborn, who, olosely attended by Correze, cut down the rest, though never dangerous to the favorite, who won by two lengths aad a half from Highborn, the latter being half- a length in front cf Correze, who was third. A length away came Enuc fourth, and c!o=s up The Admiral was fifth, Then came Chaldean, Meloe, Little Becnie, Muriel, CariingtoD, Jebusite, Sir William, and others, the last to come in being Mantilla, Esmeralda, Jebusite, Emancipation, Benzon, Eenaui, Lawyer, and Newmaster, Time, 3 min, 28.} BEC.-the quickest on record.
