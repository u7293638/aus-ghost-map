GHOSTS. Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling so white npon the carpet, and Bhowing all its figures bo distinctly, making every objeot so minutely visible, yet so unlike a morning of noontide visibility, is a medium the moat suitable for a romanoe-writer to get acquain ted with his illusive guests. There is the little domestic scenery of the well-known apartment, the ohairs, with eaoh its separ ate individuality ; the oentre-table, sustain ing a work-brsket; a yolume or two, and an extinguished lamp} the sofa ; the book case ; the pioture on the wall—all these details, so completely seen, are so spiritua lised by the unusual light, that they seem to lose their actual substance, and become things of intelleot. Nothing is too small or trifling to undergo thiB change, and acquire dignity thereby. A ohild’s Bkoe ; the doll seated in her little wioker-oarriage; the hobby-horse; whatever, in a word, haB been used or played with during the day is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness, though still almost as vividly present as by daylight. Thus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room has beoome a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and eaoh imbue itself with the nature of the other. Ghosts might enter here without affrighting us. It would be too muoh in keeping with the scene to exoite surprise, were we to look about us and discover a form, beloved, but gone henoe, now Bitting quietly in a atreak of this magic moonshine, with an aspect that would make us doubt whether It had returnod from afar, or had neyer ence stirred from our fireside.
