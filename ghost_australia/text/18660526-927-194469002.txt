There ^^^pn and a good deal j ^^^^^^Hphshiniiud house' was ^^^^^Rhr pin. 'Though of j H^H^R W*? P.°t one that) seemed to be of any use in this world, exempt the mother. She was a tall hand some lady, with black hair, and fine up right carriage; but fit her her wonderful ', managing, or the trials and disappoint i ments she had met with, had given her a | look half sour and half scornful, as if she I was not pleased with the world in general, and despised everybody about her. It always appeared to me the person she despised most was Mr. Denby. He was tall and handsome too, but had a fair cimplexion, light sandy hair, and a slow, I simple, hesitating way, as if he had neither iudgment nor will of his own. The three daughters, Miss Maria, Miss Ellen, and Miss Charlotte, aud the one son, Mr. George, took after their father. They had the same sandy hair and the same fair complexion, but three plainer young ladies were not to be seen in a day's travel ; and if Mr. George had the full-compliment of commontsense, he did not look like it. However/ nobody could have a higher opinion of themselves* than the Misses Denby and their brother. I am not sure that every one of the three didn't believe she was a beauty ; and Mr. George had such a notion of his own abilities, that half of his time was Rpent in the library, as he said, composing history, and the other half in setting people right. They had manifestly enough to do with their income, and aspired to more fashion and finery than they could well keep, but it was done by close carving. Everything about the house that did not come before their genteel company was on the saving system ; ,and I soon found out that if Mrs. Deuby was director upstairs, Esther the cook was manager below. She was a gray haired, hard- featured woman, with a re markable habit of grumbling and shewing the worst side of things, but just and honest to a hair. Except myself, the Denbies had no servants but her and her family. Her daughter was housemaid ; her son was man-ofallwork, called gardener, coachman, and butler by turns ; her grandson was errand-boy ; and her sister came in for laundry-work and charing. Esther had a good deal of her own way, and told her mind pretty plainly to all the Denbies. I often wondered to myself that the mistress, of whom all the rest stood in such awe, took with her so well, but she did ; and there seemed to be an understanding be tween them that the one was not to inter fere with the other. Esther took roe in hand from my firat coming, taught me my duties, and was civil to me on the whole, for I did my best to please her, seeing well that she was second mistress in the house, aud kept her son, her daughter, her grand son, and her sister as much in order as Mrs. Denby kept the five up stairs. Esther had a great pride in the family she served : her father and mother had lived with the old generation of Denbies before their estate was run through. She had been with the present people in their poor days at Ipswich, and their travels in France, where the grandmother died She had come tack with them, and in a manner helped to get them back the Pines, as one of the witnesses of tho old lady's death and burial. '?' I suppose it was natural for her to hold the Denbies high. Their grandeur was the one subject she did not grumble at or see faults in ; and as I was the only stranger in the house, she was for ever letting me know what great people they were, and what luck I had in getting into their service. I took it all in, of course, that being my best policy ; but the simplest parlor-maid would have noticed that for all their con ceit of themselves, the Denbies were a dull solitary family. I never heard a laugh among them while they sat together at the table or .the fireside. They didn't exactly quarrel, but their time was spent in small fretful janglea about every trifle ; and they have all got a nervous, frightened way of starting and getting disturbed at every passing sound or shadow. From long living with them, Esther and her family got the same habits. In short, it was a dreary house above and below ; and in spite of myself and all the sensible teaching I had got from Mrs. Wright, old Sarah Jones' talk would come back to my momory as the days grew shorter, and the nights lengthened, for I had gone to the Pines in the harvest time. One thing greatly helped to make the place cheerful— there were almost no comers or callers. Rich or poor, there was always such a ceremony and fuss about letting them in. The county families sel dom came, except to the grand parties. The Denbies had no relations that they were not on bad terms with. No follow ers were allowed or were wanted in the kitchen ; and no friends came to the par lour but the gentleman that came unknown to his father, young Mr. Morley. It was a wonder his comings were not found out at home, for Morley Lodge was not a mile from the Pines, and the old gentleman was always about looking after his farm and his tenants. But there he was every second evening at least Just as the night began to fall, we would hear his ring at the gate. All the house knew it He was always welcome with the old folks, I never heard Mr. George Betting him right And tlie fluster the young ladies got into at his arrival was something uncommon. What they &aw; in him to be taken on with, I could never wake out, except that he was heir of Morley Lodge and lands, his father being a widower, and having no other child. He was a small sharp-looking man, that might have been any age, though they said he was under twenty-five, with no colour about him but a sort of turnip white, a broken nose, and a pair of eyes like needles. | Any girl will takfe notes of a courting business, and as young Mr. Morley could be come on nothing else, it was but natu ral for me to take notes of him and his doings. Nobody has better opportunities for the like than a parlour-maid; but watch as I would, it was beyond my powers to make out which of the young ladies he was after. Esther was clear that it was Miss Maria — Miss Denby it was proper to call her, she being the eldest, but we only minded that on state times. Certainly he did stand behind her at the piano — Miss Maria wa3 the singing and playing one of the family— turned the leaves of the music-book for her, and looksd i'p all the while as if he heard au j angpl. But I saw him the next rainnte : pending over Miss Ellen'i drawing* at the i other side of the room, and whispering ] something that put her all in a simper ; 1 and after that he woiihl be admiring Miss ! Charlotte's embroidery, and squeezing her hanJ under the work-table. It puzzled me, and it made all the sisters jealous of each other, though each was half sure of young Morley, and noticed that he kept his tricks well out of the old people's sight, and always talked sensibly .ind neighbour like to them and Mr. George. From tbat talk I learned that he had come back from his travels at the beginning of the year, a little before the country gossips began to wonder at his goings to the Pines : that he had been at the same places where the Denbies lived when they were abroad, and had seen their grandmother's grave in a French burying- grouod. He used to speak of that with a groat show of feeling : I couldn't help thinking it was because his father lost the Piues by her death, that Mr Morley tooktothesubject often ; but, some how, though the Denbies all tried to look as though they liked to be sympathised with for the loss of the old lady, it was plain to me that they would rather have heard him on anything else. I don't know if the young gentleman observed me watching him, but I had cause to blame myself for it, as he soon began to watch me. At first it was taking notes in his turn, though one might wonder what he could find curious about a parlour maid; but by and by I got nods and winks and admiring . looks, always given behind backs, and I never saw the man that could screen himself from eyes he did not wish to be seen by, and that was mani festly the Denbies and all their servants. My mother had brought me up wisely ; Miss Wright had taught me well ; aud I had sense enough to know that a gentle man's notice seldom brings good to a poor girl. '? But all that might not have served me if I had not from the beginning taken a sort of dislike, or bad opinion, of young Mr. Morley. As I have said, he was no beauty ; his eyes were cunning as well as sharp ; and his crafty 'way of courting the three sisters, warned me, young as I was, to have nothing to do with him. So his nods and winks and looks were taken no notice of, though I couldn't help seeing them, and no doubt he knew I did, for one evening when I happened to open the gate for him, and nobody was looking out, it being almost dark, he caught hold of my hand with : ' Jane,- I have some thing very particular to say to you ; will you meet me to-morrow evening iu the Orchard Lane ?' ' I will not, sir,' said I, drawing away my hand, and turning to the house. ' Why, Jane,' he said, catching me by the skirt, ' I am dying to speak to you ; it's something very particular.' ' Go and tell it to my mother, then ; she lives at Slater's Cottages, not far from Hedingham Church ;' and I tried to pluck my skirt away. ' You are a good girL Jane,' said he, letting mo go, but the hypocrite was in his voice. ' I will tell your mother, and it's something she'll be glad to hoar ; but you must not say a word about it, for I am going to London the day after to-morrow, and can't see your mother till I come back: promise me you .won't Jane ; it's for your own good.' ' Upon my word, I won't,' Raid I ; being young and foolish, I half believed that something wonderful was going to be done for me ; but the words were scarcely out, when Mr. Denby came to the hall door, and in young Morley marched, looking as innocent as a turtle-dove, and inquiring for all the family. He got on as usual that evening, and left at the usual hour. I suppose he went to London ; T heard him tell the Denbies he would go, and they saw no more of him for some time. I went about my work day after day, wondering what the very particular thing he had to say could be ; but within the same week I got something worse to wonder at. To make my story plain, I must tell you that the Pines had got a sort of wing, which, being a story lower than the rest, was entirely hidden by the pine-grove that gave the place its name. .It must have been dark, too, with the shade of those tall trees ; but the windows were all shut up, for none of the rooms were occupied or ever had been in the Denbies' time : they had walled up the door of the passage leading to them from the hall, and hung a picture — I think it was a wedding scene — over the place. The tale went, . that those rooms were built long ago for a lady of the house, who would not leave it, and couldn't jive at peace' with her daughter-in-law. Esther, though, she was civil enough on the subject, would give me so explanation of their being shut up, except that the family had room enough withou them, and they were damp and dark with the shadow of the old pines. ' The wing had a base ment story, however, which was dry enough to be used as a store-room for all manner of things kept or wanted in a country house, from preserves to best flour. It opened from a passage at the end of the lower balL Esther kept the key, and seldom allowed anybody to go there but herself — I thought on account of the good things. But there had been a great drying of herbs, and a great gathering in of choice apples all the week ; and on Saturday evening, a bag of the one and a basket of the other were still to be put away. Things had been late that day, and every body was busy, though it was full two honrs after dark ; the cook had gone up stairs to get some orders about a hot supper they wanted ; the laundress was doing up finery; the housemaid was helping her, j principally with some frills of her own ; and ' Jane,' said she, as I came down to help too, ' them there happles and 'arbs is to be laid by, and I'm in the clear starching line : take the key off the mantel-piece, aud put 'cm away ; do, before mother comes down, for she bid me to do it, and she'll go on extonishin' if it ain't done.' I took the bag and the basket on my one arm, and the key and candle in my other hand, and went off to the store-room.. It was easy enough to opeu ; and inside there was all manner of chests, barrels, and boxes, with shelves in every corner fiUed up to the ceiling, for nearly all the stores were got in. I had hung up the herbs, and was making room for the apples, not thinking, I declare, of anything but the j business in hand, when a rustic at the | further end of the room made me look up, ' and there, coming out from between two great casks, 1 ww an old woman, in what I verily believe to be grave-clothe.*, laugh ing without a sonnd, and without a tooth, and making right up to me. I remember fleeing in mortal terror, falling over halfa dozen things, and at last, getting into the kitchen, where I must have fainted out right, for the next thing I recollect is seeing them all about me, and hearing Esther say : ' What is the matter, Jane I' ' I want to go home,' said I, not know ing what else to say, and feeling quite sure that all old Sarah Jones said was true. ' Nonsense, child : you can't go home at this hour of the night : take this glass of cider, and come up stairs with me.' Esther took me by the arm as she spoke, and marched me up to her own room ; it was the best one in the attic ; there she shut the door, sat down beside me, and once more asked me what was the matter. As soon as I could find breath, I told her plainly what I had seen in the store-room, and my resolution to go home in the morn ing. The cook seemed nearly as frightened as myself, and a great deal more troubled. 'Well, Jane,' she said kindly, 'you shall go home if you like ; it was not your fault, but theirs that sent you to the store room. Say nothing more about it, like a good girl, but try to get composed, aud come down to supper. You shall sleep in the closet off my room to-night, and keep the door between us open, if you please.' I did try to get composed, but I was not myself that night, and a little of the supper wont far with me. On my way down stairs, I passed tbo door of Mrs. , Donby's room ; it was fast shut ; but I could hear low earnest voices inside, which I knew were hers and Esther's. The cook came down shortly after, but all the supper time she was frowning at her daughter, and uncommonly kind to me. I was thankful for that, and alss for getting my bed brought into the closet off her room, where I slept all night with many a start and many a bad broken dream. But daylight takes the weight of every fright off one, and when I woke next morning, my mind was a good deal settled. They had let me sleep later than usual, and there was Esther standing by my bedside with a parcel in her hand. Just as I opened my eyes, she opened it, and shewed me a beautiful dress of fine French print ' It's for you,' she said, ' if you are a wise girL Jane, you are a good girl ; you go to church, and read your Bible, and tell no fibs, and them as does that needn't be frightened out of a place for anything they happen to see. Jane, this is a gentetl place ; the missus likes you, and so do I ; your wages will be raised ten shillings a quarter; you'll get this dress, as is the first of the fashion, and was bought by Miss Maria; there'll be tea and flannel goin' to your mother at Christmas ; and Mr. Denby could speak to the parish overseers for her in hard times — that's if you make up your mind to stay, and say nothiug about the family trouble. Jane, every genteel family has something strange about their house — 1 mean real gentry like my missus and master, and not the get-ups now-a-days. Besides, Jane, nobody ever saw anything here except in the store room, and I'll promise you shan't have to go there again. ? If my daughter Sophy, as is the biggest goose in Suffolk, axes you to do the like, just say you won't, aud I'll stand by you. But take my advice, Jane, and don't leave such a good place.' To this hour, I can't understand why Mrs. Denby and her cook were so set upon keeping me. May be it was that they knew my family to be decent people, poor as they arc, and not given to gossip ; or may be they had to do it on account of what was to happen, and the hand I was to have in it; like enough there is an order in such things. At any rate, Esther over-persuaded me. Now that the day light was come, and I had got over the fright, the fine new dress, the raising of my wages, and the help promised to my poor mother, was more than I could refuse ; and before Esther had left the room, I gave her my word to stay at the Pines, and say nothing of what I had seen to anybody but my mother. . They had such great want of me that day and several after, that I did not get home till the next Sunday evening. I suppose it was to let the fright wear off, and it had worn pretty well by that time ; but my mother turned white with the very thought of it, when I told her at our own cottage fireside. The children had gone to evening church, and left us alone. She sat for a minute or two without speaking 'a word, and then—' Jane,' said she, ' nothing ever rises out of notbink ; old Sarah and the rest of the gossips didn't tell such stories after all ; and it's not for nothink the old lady' has come after them Denbies. They got. rid of her in France, you see, to get back the Pines.; but murder will out ; and you must come home to me, if we have but a loaf in the week ; I wont see my girt frightened out of her mind.*' Tbat was my mother's first saying ; but when. I made her cousider the new dress, the raised wages, and all that had been promised to her, she came- to think as I did ; for six young ones to feed on nothing but one's own hard work and parish help, would make most people fake any chance, temporal or spiritual, as learned folks say, So my mother consented that I should stay at the Pines, warning me, at the same time to keep well out of the store-room, and take my Bible with me if ever I had to go about the house after dark. We knew it was necessary to keep the whole matter a secret, and it was one that weighed heavy on my mind. The large lonely house became twice as dreary after that Saturday evening, and I never liked to see the night coming down. It seemed to me that the tempers in it were growing worse too ; Esther and her daughter were never done jangling, and most of their disturb ance was about the store-room, or the key of it Up stairs there was not a bit more peace. None of them ever took the slightest notice of what had happened to me ; you would have thought they knew nothing at all about it ; but their small genteel bickerings went on for evermore, and most of them were about young Mr. Morley. . .Hehad not come back from London yet, at least they thought bo, and the shooting season was drawing to its eud, when I was going home one Sunday evening by what we called the Orchard Lane — a by-way leading through the fields straight to my mother's cottage, which stood about two miles from the Pines. Some parts of the lane were close and darkened with over hanging trees, and in the darkest of them I was startled by hearing a step behind me, and there was young Morley. ' Good evening, Jane,' said lie, ' you are goiug to see your mother and so am I*; you know I have something very particular to s;iy to her and you. Jane, how well that dress becomes you ; you're the girl to show off clothes ; it ought to be silk instead of calico, and so it shall before long, may be.' He had got hold of my hand with I that, and I was thinking sf starting off, for j I never liked his look, when up comes my t mother in her poor Sunday clothes to meet me, and didn't she look thunder-struck ! ' It's Mr. Morley, mother,' said I, ' and he has something particular to say to i you.' ' Mrs. Stocks,' said he, stepping up to her before she had time to drop her best courtesy, 'have you any objection to your daughter's being 6ent to a first-rate board ing-school ?' ' None in the world, sir,' said my mo ther. ' But who's going to do it ?' 'Who but a friend — a real friend, atrue friend, Mrs. Stocks. I know you were astonished to see me speaking to your daughter, but you would be more surprised if you knew all. I'm a man of few words, Mrs. Stocks, but set your mind at rest ; I have no bad intentions, no wicked designs : when I set my affections on a girl ' — and Mr. Morley rolled his eyes at me — ' be her family ever so humble, I first educate, and then make her my bride !' I thought my poor mother would have taken wing and gone up into the air with perfect joy ; she believed that I was first to be sent to a boarding-school, and then made the Lady of Morley Lodge, and the grand prospect buzzed her head up like strong beer. She fell to thanking aud blessing young Morley, telling him all my perfections and a great many more than I had :. how much I was above the common cauntry girls; how little the Denbies knew my value, and how few young folks would stay at the Pines as I bad done. Morley walked on between us, seeming to believe all she said, sounding my praises himself, and making scornful remarks on the Denbies, especially the young ladies ; but all at once he stopped, and asked in a quiet, confidential manner, if there was any truth in the report he had heard about the Pines — was there anything particular to bo seen or heard in the house ? I had pro mised to Esther, and my mother had pro mised to me, to say nothing about what I had seen in the store-room ; but in the fulness of her heart she told Mr. Morley the whole story, and made me repeat it from beginning to end. My tale seemed to impress him wonderfully ; he questioned me closely regarding the figure I had seen, the part of the room it came from, tho ways and arrangements of the place, and what Esther had said about the matter. I told him all as far as I could remember, and he looked so grave and serious tbat my mother ventured to ask him if he thought there had been foul play. 'Yes, Mrs, Stocks,' said ho, 'there must have been, when such things are to be seen about a Christian house. Provi dence will doubtless bring the crime to light, and the guilty to justice ; but your daughter has nothing to fear ; she has had no part in the evil-doing. — Jane' — with that he turned to me — 'keep up your courage, for my sake, and also keep your own counsel ; everything depends on that : you know I have a proud father : if a word of our talk this day gets wind, we are parted for ever ; you'll remember that, too, Mrs. Stocks. But, bless me, there is the church clock striking six 1 I'll be too late for dinner, perhaps suspected. Adieu, adieu 1' and he darted down the lane. ' 0 Jane,' said my mother, lifting up her hands, 'won't I die happy when I see you lady of Morley Lodge, wearin' silks and satins, and doin' somethink for us all!' ' Mother, dear,' said I, honestly speak ing my mind, ' the gentleman can't mean it What would he see in me! You know Pm no beauty, with a wide mouth and a stumpy nose.' ' No, Jane,' said she ; ' you ain't just a beauty, but I always thought there was somethink hinterestin' about you. Mind, there's no hexplainin' the fancies men takes ; it's one of them harrers of love that has struck him ; aud don't you be a fool to throw away your prospecs.' My mother said a good deal more to the eame purpose that evening, and at last I came to think as she did, and to be quite as much elevated with the expectation of being made lady of Morley Lodge. If the gentleman did not mean that, what else could he mean 1 I never liked him, but what charmed the three well-dressed Den bies was surely taking enough for tbeir parlour-maid. It was to be, my mother Baid, and I believed that everything de pended on keeping the secret, as Mr. Mor ley had warned us. We were aho sure my mother could keep the like better than most people ; and I went back to the Pines resolved that neither up nor down stairs people should get an inkling of it from me. Mr. Morley came back to the Pines, too, tha very next evening, making believe to be fresh from Loudon, and I was something more than surprised to see him getting on iu the very same style he bad always done with the three sisters ; indeed, there was rather more of it to be seen as the weeks passed on, for he came almost every even ing. ' It's on your account, Jane ; its just to get a sight of you, he comes so often,' said my mother when I told her of it ' Has for his carryin' on with them young ladies, it was begun before he saw you, aud cau't be dropped now, or there would be no welcome for Mm. Ain't it remark able that he should know what's about their house, and speak of it just like a preacher ; but that's nothink to you and me, Jane ; we have no part in the sin, as Mr. Morley said. Just keep you quiet till he tells yon to get ready for the boardin' school ; in course it'll be with a ten-pound note or so ; and then, Jane, let 'em dance hornpipes at us if they thinks proper.' Having settled our minds on that, my mother and I lived on for weeks and months, expecting every day that Mr. Morley would tell ub to get ready or call at the cottage. He neither told not called, ! however, but seemed to be getting more ftieudly with the Denbies day by day. Half his time was i- ? ?»-; n m their house now; and though he kept it well from their eyes, j I felt ture his cunnings were on my j account, he took such notice of me behind backs, and when I happened to open the f:ate for him, which was as often as I could, he would squeeze my haud and say, ' Wait, Jane, wait, and keep your own counsel ; something will happen before long.' Nothiug had happened, though, when the Christmas-time came ci-, and with a great party at the Pines ; it was one of the grand affairs the Denbies had iu the year — I believe tbe principal one, and had come off regularly on Christmas-day ever since they got the house. I don't kuow if there always was such a commotion of scouring out and decorating rooms up stoirs, and making up all sorts of good things below. Esther, her daughter, and her sister, were up to their eyes in work for a week before ; so was I, being wanted to help everybody. The young ladies got new dresses from London ; waiters and plate were hired from the county-town ; and I never imagined that the family could be so free with their money, or in such good- humour among themselves. There was a good deal still to be done when Christmas-eve ctme. When the night was falling, the whoU house were as busy as bees, for Mrs. Dtnby would have nothing left till the last hour ; and as Mr. Morley was not expected that evening — ho had told them he was to dine at his uncle's — the young ladies wsre all in their morning dresses, giving helpiag- hands. All at once there was a servant's ring at the gate, and Mrs. Denby sent me to open it, with strict orders to let nobody h. The weather was clear and frosty, and I ran down without a lantern, but there whs light enough to shew that it was Mr. Korley. ' Hush, my dearesi Jane,' said ho, squeezing my one hand, and putting a little box into the other ; l: I Lave contrived this stratagem to see yot in private. That box contains Christmas presents for the three scarecrows, but you must Bay that it was our footman brought them ; and here's a present for yourself, my pretty Jane.' He squeezed my hand again, and put a very small parcel into it. ' There will be something better by and by,' he went on ; ' but Jane, my own Jine, you must do me a little serrice.' ' What is it, Mr. Morley V said I, ready to do almost anything. ' Well, Jane, said he, ' it's just to get me the key of tho store-room to-morrow night.' ' What do you want with it, sir !' was all I could get out in my astonishment. ' To see what you did — to know if the house is haunted, or if a murder has been done. Get me the key, Jane, or leave it in the door. Surely you will do more than that for my sake!' ' I'll do it if I can,' said I, in a hasty ; whisper, for there was some one coming out. ' Good night. Don't forget to say with young Mr. Morley's compliments,' said he in a voice which nobody would have known to be his, and was out of sight in a minute. I went in with the little box and the story about Mr. Morley's footman. If the presents had been all real diamonds, the three scarecrows, as he called them, could not have made a greater fuss. They were all fine flash things — a brooch for one, a bracelet for another, and a locket for a third ; but I heard Mrs. Denby say, when she thought me out of the room, that they hadn't cost him much— he was the man to take care of his money. I couldn't help thinking so, too, when I got time to look at my present, for it was just a pink silk hand kerchief ; but there was to be something better by and by, and I was bound to get him the key of the store-room. That promise troubled me terribly ; it was so strange that Mr. Morley should want the like, and the words he used about it were so queer and dark. What would the Denbies say if they found it out 1 But he had asked me to do it for his sake. I knew my mother would never forgive me, if I didn't; she would call that pitching away good prospects indeed ; so my mind was made up that Mr. Morley should have the key if I could get it Well, Christmas-evening came ; there was a grand dinner ready ; the house was blazing with lights from kitchen to attic ; one would never have thought it had been the dull, dreary place I found it for many a month before, or that the sight I got in the store-room was to be seen about it. The rooms and tables were grandly set out ; the family were all as fine as dress could make them. I was in my best trim to help the hired waiters to attend on the company, and in they came about six o'clock. Such a rush of carriages and snch grand ladies I had never seen before. Half lie gentry of Suffolk must have been there, aud among them young Mr. Morley, His father was not expected ; the Denbies and he had not come to such friendly terms yet ; but Esther told me they soon would. He was dressed in the height of the fashion, with such elegant gloves and tie as nearly made me think him hand some ; and my head nearly turned on my shoulders when the fine gentleman, just entering tho drawing-room door, said in my car : ' Dearest Jane, I will be down when dinner's over. Be sure to have the key.' In he went ; and I wonder there wasn't a stock of glass and china smashed by me that dinner-time, my brain was so busy with the pride and the fear of the thing. There was no great trouble in getting the key ; Esther kept it on the mantel-piece, and they were all in a bustle below, j took the first opportunity to steal out to the passage, and there was Mr. Morley waiting for me. He had risen with the ladies when they retired to the drawing room, and I never knew a man who could slip out of sight like him. ' Thank you, dearest Jane,' he said, clutching the key out of my fingers. ' I will reward your truth to me ; but go in, darling, go into the kitchen, for fear you are missed ;' and he glided away towards the store-room. The passage -to it was pitch dark ; Esther had got out her sup plies, and nobody else thought of going there. I was afr.dd to follow him; and after listening for some minutes, in which I could hear no Bound of his movements, the dread of being missed came on me, and I stole back to tbe kitchen. There we all made merry over fuch fine things as never had been on the Denbies' tabla in my time, while the Suffolk genile men sat over their wine up stairs, and the ladies were at their polite conversation in the drawing-room. It was a breathing or a stuffing time before the tea and the rest of the evening's work cauie on, and we were determined to make the most of it, for a Suffolk party is no joke. The strong ale was making us lively, and Esther was getting high on the dinners of former times, when all at once there rang through the house a volley of most unearthly screeches, followed by the loud long biast ^,aj of a bugle-horn and thundering suunds at the back-door, which was directly broken in, and a number of men with staves and lanterns rushed through the passage to the storeroom. All the women down stairs ? set up a general scream ; all the ladies above went off in hysterics ; all the gen tlemen shouted from the dining-room to know what was the matter ; all the z bells in the house were ringing, and nobody i '! answered them. I never heard or dreamed of such an uproar, and I wouldn't ' ; have gone out for the world to see what ,/ti had become of Mr. Morley ; but at the '^ height of the tumult a fleeing foot came ? down the stairs, and I heard Mrs. Denby's ^ voice sayng, ' For mercy's sake, dou't ex- ? j pose us : we'll give you back the Pines ; a we'll leave the country ;' and the pest was **^ lost in the rushing down of the gentlemen. y I don't know what explanation they got '. a -^ there was a great Seal of low and hurried feS talk in and about the store-room ; most of §t them went up again with amazed faces; „] and such a going home from a party was *i never seen. They drove away from the 3 house as fast as their coaches could carry j them ; the hired waiters packed up the y plate and went off too. The men who had j broken in at the back-door came out of the j storeroom, bringing along something like j a walking bundle of clothes ; young Mr. \ Morley had hold of it on the one side ; his - j father had hold of it on the other. The 1 rest of the men were servants at the j Lodge, but they all went upstairs with Mr. | and Mrs. Denby. I thought Esther would 1 have lost her senses. ' Who had let the J villian in J' she had kept crying, till in my i 1 terror that she might hit on me, I darted 1 out of the broken back-door, and, dark l J winter night as it was, fled home tn- my F 1 mother. ?-- '? - - 1 Her consternation was nearly aB -great c 1 as my own, but she agreed that I .was- well ; v I out of the Pines ; and by and by we f got r f J a clear understanding of what had hap- ' *? 1 pened there. It was no ghost that I and ? . | others had seen in the store- room, but the K\i living grandmother, old Mrs. De nby her- f *i self. Her death and burial in France -was j^.J all a make-believe, contrived among them . ;--';i to get back the property. Goodness kuows . )-M how they managed to smuggle her home, # - ;3 and deceive old Morley and hw lawyers ; jia but they did it ; and there she lived 'iu the j|9 shut-up back wing, giving the house the fil reputation of being haunted, for somehow fll or other the poor old lady never could or ||1 would keep out of the store-room, there . f||l being a door of communication behind the ||| barrels, which they dare not lock for fear j|9 of her making a noise. How young Morley ||] came to suspect the case, I never could §|1 make out ; maybe it was owing to some- §? thing he heard on his travels. At -any rate £? he got an end of the clue, i»nd wound it H off straight enough for his father and ^M himself. The Denbies, grandmother and ^M all, cleared out of the Fines so quickly and H quietly that nobody could say when or H where they went; but the Morleys did H not let them go till, from- fcar of exposure |H aud the law, they made them sign over M the Pines to themselves and tbeir heirs 19 for ever. They said there was a small an- ill nuity allowed to the family — small enough fji it must have been, coming from the.Mor- ???j ley's — but nobody was very clear on that !? Jj point, nor on any other part of the story ; ? \'M it never became downright public, but was JS whispered about by the country gossips, fM who got it from the servants at Morley jM Lodge ; and there was people in that part il of Suffolk who believe the Piues to be |1 haunted to this day. The best of it was §1 that nobody ever suspected the haud I- had ?i in the business. ' ? - j '? 1 ' But your bread's baked,' said my 1 mother : ' he'll be sendiu' you . to .the :-| boardiu' -school directly. I wake up every ? -hm mornin' thinkin' ? I hear the joy- bells peal- I] ing for your weddin.' ... ? » jj She was saying so one forenoon, - some -. 11 days after my flight from the Pines, when ' yj Mr. Moriey's own man looked in at our |1 door, and told me his master wanted, to - ' 1 see me for a few minutes in the Orchard ? j Lane. I lost no time, you may be sure, ': 'j and there he was with a purse in- his * J hand. I *? Jane,' Baid he, ' I wanted to see you, |] because you did me a good service on l| Christmas-evening.' fi| ' Don't mention it,' said I, meaning to M shew my manners, ? | 'I won't mention it .to anybody but 1 yourself, Jane ; it wouldn't look well j ' , A people might say you stole that key ; this 4 is a censorious world ; bnt you did me a j good service, and a good service ought to j | be rewarded. Here are five sovereigns in |.;| a purse of my own,' said Mr. Morley, ? J ;| handing me a remarkably well-worn one ; j a 'and, Jane,' he continued, 'you and: j | your mother are not to misunderstand; the : j j little joke I made with you hereone Sim- j day ; it didn't mean anything, you- know.. j I am going to be married next week. ? to ? j Miss Hopper, the great brewer's daughter, j and Pm sure she will take you for a par- j lour-maid, if yon like to come back to [ j your old place, for we mean to live at the j - Fines.' ? H ' Thank yon, air, but I have been at the jjj Pines long enough ;' and not knowing | what else to say or do, I turned fromMm, I and ran back to tho cottage. For -lays I after I thought my poor mother would j break her heart with disappointment and j vexation ; but she got over it at last, and | partly comforted herself with calling Mor- I ley a base deceiver for the rest of her time. We kept our secret, and our neigh bours got no opportunity of laughing at os. I dare say my experience at the Pines made me wiser for the future. I have been a parlour-maid in many, genteel places since then ; I have seen a good many courtships, and maybe had my own chue, bat I never av or heard of Mr. Chi-T&iri; J '.limit.

Angelica was now nine teen or twenty years of a^e. The Qaten, who took the most lively interest in her young protegee, earnestly thought of mar rying her. Sir Joshua Reynolds offered Angelica his hand, but was refused, since he was only an improvised nobleman ; pre tension, ae it is mostly is the world, had replaced in Angelica simplicity of thought and manners. There was a host of iiat ttrers around her, bat she never knew the solace of a friend. Gold and silver she fcjind everywhere ; she was clad in velvet and Bilk ; bat in the wide and bril liant circle of her acquaintances «be looked in vain for the confiding car of a friend — for the soothing voice of a true sympa thising soul. She was alone ! One even ing as she was at Court, the Queen sat beside, her, and fondly patted her pretty little hand. She then whispered into the Royal car that the day before she bad married the Count de Hoorn, a foreign nobleman of immense wealth, who had only just arrived from the Continent The Queen was charmed with the news, and desired to be introduced to the Count, who was favored with an invitation to the forthcoming drawing-room. The Count ?was presented to George IIL, and then to the Queen, who congratulated her guest on his extraordinary, discreet, and rapid con quest of her proUgte. Congratulations, of course, poured in from all ends of the ealoon. The Count felt perplexed, then vexed, then indignant. He was as ignorant of the happy event as weil as of the per son whom fee was supposed to hare wedded. He iefi the Coon.

What would happen now, if a forse landed, with the avowed intention o:' overthrowing your authority and ab&liwiitg; the hated land code \ Would the landlords be able to induce their tenantry to follow them to the field in defence of insecurity of tenure and high rents — in defence of a system which allows one man to sweep away the inhabitants of a whole countryside (as was recently done in Donegal, by Mr. John George Adair) and even places the Queen's troops at his disposal to assist him in exterminating the Queen's subjects — in defence of a eyatem which recognises no more right in the tiller of the soil, inder pendently of the will of his landlord, than it does in the beast that draws the plough? It is this system which makes everv neasant in Ireland, and many more besides, in the language of the Under Secretary for the Colonies, ' every man in a certain rank of life who leaves Ireland an enemy to England.' What would happen if a force came to Ireland, no matter from whence, to up root it ? Why, this would happen — that you would have to ccntend with that force for the dominion of Ireland, and, if you met with any disaster, with that force sustained by almost the whole agri cultural population, to say nothing of the part would be taken by the vast majority of the artisan, labouring and small tr?dfr classes.
