Again, as plate is officially stamped in certain places, and not in others, a collector will be put on his guard if he finds the mark on an unusual portion of the article. It is not difficult, of course, to notice when a modern German saint has been soldered on to an old spoon to make an Apostle, a kind of simony in bric-a-brac. Old teapots which were plain are also chased by' modern goldsmith's ghosts to deceive the simple and guileless. A late Government, from motives of econonn/,"sold theoldsilver badges of the beef eaters. A clever person metamorphosed these into sconces with candlesticks, and sold them as if the whole scores were as ancient as the mark on the beef eaters' badge. Old Queen Ann saucepans are made into tankards and mugs, and there is no end, in short, to these ways which are dark, and tricks which prove any thing but vain. In 1872, no fewer than (28 pieces of Queen Ann plate were sold to a collector. Six hundred of them were proved to bear spurious marks. On this followed much litigation, and the moral is that we should be even more than usually careful when we buy old plate, except, of course, when we intend to give it away as a wedding present.
