ALL ENGLAND V. AUSTRALIA.— THE THIRD MATCH. Bt MID-ON. LONDON, 15TU Acousi. The last of tho throo matohes arranged to be contosted by tho fourth Australian elovon and tlio best team in England has becomo a thing of tho post, nnd during tho threo days of its continuance created tho moat intense interest, as it was naturally oxpoctcd Buoh an event would do. esDocinllv as tho two Drovious snatches had resulted in ono most prouounood fiefoat of tho Anstrallans, and ono drawn In their favor, which both sides agreed must havo been a viotory had time permitted of tho game being played out on the occasion. Tho third matoh — that now undor notice — commonoed at the Oval on tho 13th fast. Tho old country was again represented by powerful team j for although A. tP. Lucas was, through family nffliotion, an absonteo, it will be soon that ills substitute, Scotton, did by far more sorvioo for liis side than any other player engaged therein. The Australian team was tlio same as In tho provious matches, Cooper and Alorandor being left out Before proooedtng to doal with the actual play I may draw atton. lion to the most important circumstances con nected with the gamo ond its surroundings, same of whioh woro of mom than ordinary in - m ,4 some of snch a nature that it woro " the story coald bo loft untold. Mar- noon s bad luok in tossing, to which I havo so roquontly - made -roforonco, changed on this mMl important occasion, to tho intense dc- uflut of the Australian, who had tho pleaouro of seeing their skipper successfully spin a halfpenny which Spofforth had picked up on the ground, Tho importance of tho t03s was ovon more than nsuaily folt, as a wickot upon whioh stumps had nover before been pitched had boon specially prepared for tho groat evont, nnd presonted a fine ap pearance. Tlio weathor moreover was excep tional, being fine, clear and biasing hot ; in fact during tho first two days tho several Australians present agreod that seldom, either on tho Melbourne or tlio Association ground iu Sydney, hod they folt tho beat to be mure in tense, The Englishmen, after their first re- verso, wero, howovor, lucky in the nomowhat remarkable fact that tho fine weather con tinued to the ond of the matoh, and tho wicket lasted so wonderfully well that tho quickest scoring of tho wholo gamo took placo during tlio last two hours of tho third day. Tho unprecedented result of tlio first day's play will probably, in first class matches, remain nn unbeaten record formany years, and Murdoch, M'Dr.nnoll and Scott ha for over associated with tho fact that on Kenningtori Oval it took the strongest team in England, ten of whom bowled, a wholo day, to capture two Aus tralian wickets at a cost of 303 runs. It will at onco bo realised without my testimony that thc.io throo batsmen plnyod first olass cricket, Murdoch, of courao, being tlio lion of the occasion. Tlio celebrated Australian bats man from start to finish played the game, tho English bowlers in turn "feeding" him in vain. His superb cutting power and faultless defenco woro shown to tho greatest advantage, whilst he onco again proved that, in the pos session of unlimited putionco, tlio greatest gift a batsman can possess, ho is second to no cricketer living. At 4l> lio mndo his first mis take, a snick off Ulyett, whioh gave a chance at the wickets. Erom that time till his total Btood at 171 ho novor made a bad stroke : but Barlow then at third man missed him badly and at 205 Steal, at' close mid-on, had a ono banded catch, which ho failed to take, nil three chances being off Ulyett. Murdoch's innings, notwithstanding, was beyond doubt worthy of being considered one of his very greatest performances, and his total (211) is at tho present time the highest score mndo in England this season in a first class match. M'DonneU has in his throe last matches exhibited an amount of patience that I must confess tho dashing Melbourne bats man's best friends never thought lie possessed, and has thus dons justice to bis splendid defensive power which on former oooasions has too often boon sacrificod to impulse, the result being three scores of b2, 69, 103. Not in tho loast degree has thi3 interfered with his punishing power, but has, in fact, strengthened it by enabling him to last longer. / In tho compilation of his first century in England lie fairly excelled himself, tho only approach to a chance given being a hard drivo back to Barnes when lis had made 52, which, how- ever, proved too hot for tho bowler to noid. Scott lias followed up his previous brilliant success by also achieving a throe fignro record, tho ambition of all batsmen iu first oias3 matohes, and a triumph indeed for the young Victorian on his first visit to England. After making 25 ho hit one back to Grace, who failed to seenra a left handed catch, and the i uly other blot on bis fine perforumnco was a chance in the long field to Lord Harris off Steol when ho had inado GO.-VJIo is, at the present moment, undoubtedly tho best leg hitter in the team, and although he has not missed a match, his batting avorago is seeond only to Murdoch's. Midwinter, at tho eom- monccmon of his innings, was missod at the wicket off Barnes, and again by I'eate in tho slips, alsoofftbeNottinghsmbowler, but neither of the doublo figures, Giffcn or Blaokham, gavo a chance. Tho latter was given out by Far- rands lbw to an underhand slow, howled ronnd the wickot with a leg break— a doubtful decision cortaiuly ; whilst Grnco, who, at the wickot, caught the ball off which Midwinter was given out, said in the pavilion that ho did not think the batsman played it. ' The bowling analysis shows that Lytteltou, with underhand slows, was the most successful bowler. On llto first day ho bowled a few overs round arm without: getting a wioket, but when tried on Tuesday- with slows he captured four in eight overs at a cost of 12 runs apiece. Peatc; .Ulyott nnd Steel wero also expensive, and' tlio.. best bowlers on tho English side wero undoubtedly Barnes and Grace ; bnt Lord Harris, as I havo" before noticed, does not apparently think' muoli of W. G. Grace ai a bowler, and to my mind very mucli underrates him. On the first day ten bowlers wero tried, and changed twenty-six times, and on the second dav the list was inado complete by Shrewsbury Trawl ing three overs, off which, by tlio way, only 2 runs were scored. But for tiic wonderful pationco and perfect defence of Scotton tlio English innings would have been an almost total collapse, and a moro meritorious performance under similar circumstances I have never witnessed. Erom tho time tbo Australians completed their colossal innings, tlio Englishmen's only hope was to Bcouro a draw, and this Scotton accomplished for thorn by staying at tho wickets fivo hours and throo quarters ond making 90 runs without one roally bad stroko, as during the whole of tlio time he gavo not the ghost of a chance. Going in first, ho was ninth out whon tho total reached 832 j during liia stay at the wickets, lie recoivod somo sovero punish ment, including ono terrible blow on the kneo from Spofforth, When tho eighth English wickot fell for 181, there were still three hours and a half to play, and tho Australians, with 370 runs to the good, hud Iiopos of accomplishing a ono innings viotory, but W. W. Bead, who iolned Scotton. asserted liis mastery over tho bowling from the outset ol his inningB, which was ono of tho best exhibi tions of clean, true and hard hitting imagiu ablo, no boundary hits boing included in his total. Aftor making 23 ho gave Spofforth a low down chano6 off his own bowling, which war, missed, bnt tho punishment inflicted on tho bowlers may bo stated from the fdot that hemadolOOrunsin exaotly two hours. Tho two batsmen named mada nearly two-thirds of tho English total, Sto'el boiug next with 31, and Lord Harris, both boing given out lbw by Tarrand, while tho champion, W. G. Grace, was run out. In connection with tbiv circumstance another of thoso disgraceful scones, for which I four the Oval will soon become notorious, took placo. Cuilon, who is considered ono of tho best, and oertainly most independent, umpires in England, offiolntcs for Gloucestershire, being engaged in business in Bristol, and ho it was who gavo Graoe out, for which ho was (on tho drawing of tho stamps) foilowod in by a bowling crowd, who hooted and hissed him right up to the pavilion gato. At another stage of tiic gamo, whon tho Englishmon wero batting, tho crowd en croached somo 15 yards on to the playing ground, nnd Giffen in attempting to stop a baU ran oloan into thcin, which led to so sorious an altercation that Lord Harris walltod ont from tho pavilion and said, " If you don't givo tho Australians fair plr.y I will give them the match." Throughout the whole of the second nnd third days indeed the mo3t un sportsmanlike spirit, was exhibited, ironical cries of "How's that?" being heard whenever Blaokham stopped a ball, and Lord Harris was jeered at in tho coarsest manner for miss ing Scott. It may readily he believed that tho pleasuro of a matcii productive of most perfect cricket on both sides was thus considerably marred, to tho great annoyance of tho3o who attend through love of the game. The result of the throe matches played is of coarse un satisfactory to both side3, for whilst England can claim n substantial victory in the only matoh complotod, nobody can deny that tho merit of the rubber rc3ta undoubtedly with Australia, whose two draws so ontirely in their favor more than counterbalance tho one defeat ; and, by comparison, it must he allowed that throe test matohes liavo served to more than uphold tho previously well won reputation of the Australians, The result of the third is especially gratifying on account of the team being knocked more or les3 to piece < by tbroo months' incessant work on hard wickets, performing an unprecedented foat in that department of the game which is supposed to ho thoir weakest point. No amount of fencing the question can alter tho fact that three matches have bcon played, and that the Australians liavo hnd a long way the best oE it, end this throughout tho trying heat, Both teams fielded with spirit, Lord Harris, Rend (who waa most effective at point), Barnes and Scotton ; and Scott, Bannerman, M'Donnoll nnd Giffen doing yeoman service for thoir respective sides. Lyttolton behind tho wickets was not seen at his best, but even with tho assistance of a long i top, was not up to Blackham's standard, the Victorian re suming his placo behind tho sticks with consi derable success, the catch by which he dis posed of Shrewsbury being a capital bit of work ; whilst tho running out of Graco wa3 very cloverly accomplished, as Bannorman re turned tho hall very wido of tho wicket. An onormons number of people witnessed the matoh, tho- numbers being (allowing for mombors) about 18,000 on the first day, 17,000 on tho second, and over 10,000 on the third. Murdoch havincr wen the to3a. sent in M'Donnell and Bannerman to tho bowling of 1'eato and Ulyett. M'DonneU started the j innings auspicously by catting Peate'9 first j bail cleverly to the ropes, repeating the stroke in Ulyett's second over, ami Bannerman hit Peato past cover point for 4, but in bis next over played one into Bead's hands at point. 1 — 4 — 15. Mnrdooh followed, and made several beautiful cuts off Ulyolt, M'DonneU j being even more' severe on Peato ; ho cut brilliantly twice, running for 4 each, tlio scoring being so rapid that 50 runs wero made in f- i ty minutes. The first change made was tho substitution of Steel for I'eate, which proving ineffectual, Steel changed ends, and Barnes . wont on iu placo of Ulyett, but not before M'DonneU had driven the latter brilliantly to the pavilion fenco. Mnrdoch shortly after fluked 4 off Bnrno3, cutting the nexi hall splendidly to the ropes. The appear, ance qf 80 brought Barlow on at Steel's end, and Murdoch did somo neat work on tho leg side, playing Barnes especially well for 4. When the total was 90, M'Donuell gave Barnes n hard catch, and then snicked Barlow to the boundary, which brought up 100. Graco replaced Barnos, and Barlow, who had bowled remarkably well, bnt unsuccessfully, retired in favor of Peato. Only half a dozen rum. had lieen scored off Graco, when Bead replaced him, bowling " lobs," to the evident satisfaction of M'Donnell, who hit him for a 2 and two 4's, tho last stroko being clean over the ropes to square log. When tho total was at 130, tho luncheon bell rang, M'Donnoll having mado 6G and Murdoch 30, the former, although scoring quickly, exhibiting eqnal patience with ills captain. On play being resumed, M'DoaneU's anxiety to reach tlio century became apparent, hie next four strokos being allj boundary hits, and just 03 Murdoch had been missed at the wickets off Ulyett, a fine drive off Peato raised M'Donnoll's total to 102, amidst the cheers of his Australian friends, who had anxiously kept tlio score since luucli tiino. Im mediately after accomplishing the century, M'DonneU was caught at short slip. 2 — 103 — 158. Scott joined his captain, and started by cutting Peatc between short slip and third rann, only juet out of harm's way, but at onco Btondiad himself, and equalled his companion in skilful cutting, Ulyett suffering aeveroty at hie hands, and being sent ropcatodly to the boundary. Ten following ton in rapid succes- sion, Barlow, Bead and Grace were in turn tried, hut still tho runs camo, and at a quarter to four 200 appeared. At 210, Scott hit ono back, which Graco with his loft hand mis3cd, and the howling was again trusted to Peate and Steel Murdoch at once drove the amateur for 4, and Scott lifted him fairly on to the voran- dah of the pavilion, Murdoch again driving him to tlio rope3. Barue3 resumed bowling, but Scott hit liim to leg for 4, nnd Murdoch cut him beautifully for 3, and a doublo change waa again mado, Lord Harris and Scotton going on. Tho scoring at once became faster than ever, and boundary hits of frequent ocour. ronce. At ten minutes to five n fine on drivo by Mnrdocl), off Scotton, mado him 100. Steel, on going on again, had bad luck, as Lord Harris missed Scott off him. and Ulyett was again tried instead of the English captain. Repeated changes, howovor, proved unavailing, the batsmen scoring at about tho same rato, and before b!x <y clock 3G0 had appeared, tho howling being completely col lared, but tho Englishmen stuok wolf to thoir fielding to the last, determined to play out time. Both bitamon, howovor, assumed a striotly defensive attitude, four successive, maidens being recorded, but at last Bcott cut Grace for 3, roaching his century, and tho stumps wero thon drawn, the total for two wlokotabeing3G3 — Murdoch 140 and Scott 101. Tho second day at the start was mucli warmer, and during tho oftornoon the heat bcoame Intense as on the Monday. At fivo minutes past noon Murdooh and Scott ro- snmed their places, to the bowling of Barnos and Peato, and when 2 runs bad been added to tho provious day's soore, a simultaneous ap peal by noarly half the English team was made oa Lyttolton at wiokots caught Scott off Barnes, 3— 1C2— 365. Giffen and Murdooh started thoir partnership by playing four maidens, but shortly after both oomraenccd to punish iVato, who gavo way to Ulyott, off whom Murdooh scored freoly, Atono o'clock 400 appeared, a now ball was called into requisition, and Ulyett's first over with it was somewhat ! sensational, as tho first hall hit Murdoch a blow i in tlio rib3, and off tho next Barlow at third I man missed a catch straight Into his hands, tlio ball outtiug liis finger, whioh was strapped I up by \V. G. Grace. Barlow, disgusted at his failure to offoct the catch, throw the hall in i wildly, and a second run was secured. Giffen I was playing oaroftiily, and looked like also j becoming a candidate for three fignro honors, : bnt after making 32 ho played "Ulyett into Stool's hands at mid-on, and rctirod, the board- j showing 4 — 32 — 432, Bonnor had mado 8, j and in the lost over before lunch was tho noxt : to go, being well caught by Bead at point off I Grace, wJio had roplaced Ulyett. 5 — 8 454. j Murdoch, who up to this time had made 190, continued toplayamost carefuigame, never onco , being tempted into risking anything that was ! at all doubtful. After iuncb, Midwinter started , by driving Grace for 4, and Murdoch cut Barnes in threo overs for two 4's and two paire, giving a chance 'to Steel, having then , made 205. J ust as tho spectators wore antici- pating tho appearance of 500, Peate caught I Murdochin the slipsoff Barnes, nnd itb needless to say that tho premier batsman of Australia returned to the pavilion amidst a storm of con- gratulatory applause. G— 211— 404, Black- i ham and Midwinter brought up the score to i 500, and shortly aftor the latter was missed by i Scotton at cover point off Steel, Tlio score I having roachcd 530, and ' as Blaokham was j scorii.g'very quickly, Lyttolton went on with ' underhand slows, Grace taking the gloves, t after having occupied evory other position . iu the field. Shortly afterwards Midwinter i was caught at the wickets, the boi-.rd i Bhowing 7—30—532. Palmer followed, ; and played carefully, while Blackham did j tho scoring off Barlow ; but his timo hr d , come, and he was given out l.b.w. to Lyttolton. t 8 — 31 — 545. Spofforth hit one of the slows I for 4, and was bowled by tho next ball 9—4 — 549, Boyle, after making a single, skied Lyttolton to long-on, and was well caught by Lord Harris, and the innings, which had occupied iu. all ton hours and three quar ters, closed for 551, Palmer carrying out his ! bat. At ten minute3 past fivo, Grace and Scotton ! started to tho bowb'ng of Bonnor and Palmer, | the erratic nature of the former's bowling in- dicating a hope that ho might capturo the champion bofore ho got sot on tho wicket, which | was still playing splendidly. Tho hope, how ever was not realised, Graco hitting Bonnor to leg twice in one over for 4, having pro- | viously made a similar stroke off tho same bowler. However, after making 19, Grace drove Palmer hard to mid off, and seeing Ban nerman fumble it, started to run, but Ban nerman returning it like a shot, though rather wide, Blackham whipped off the baits with a sweep round, and the champion was run out, to tho groat joy of the Australians. 1 — 19 — 32, The crack batsman again indulged in his two ! frequent habit under such circumstances of hesitating before going, and by his action expressing his disapproval, which doubtless bad a good deal to do with inducing tho rough clement to act in such a disgraceful manner towards Pullen. Barno3 joined Scotton, who narrowly escaped being caught at point off j Palmer, hut Spofforth wa3 too Blow, and the j score gradually mounted to GO, when Mid winter, at third man deep, made a magnificent I catch off Spofforth, which disposed of Barnes, j 2 — 19 — 60. Shrewsbury nnd Scotton played oat timo, tile total being 75 when play cea3ed for tho day, the former having scored 0 and j Scotton 21. i Saturday morning was close and dull, but I again tho wicket rolled out well. Midwinter I started to Shrewsbury, who hit his first, a full pitch, to log for 4, bnt off the fourth he was well canght at the wickot by Blackham, 3 — 10 — 75. _ Steel'signalised his arrival on the scene by complaining to Spofforth that tho latter's feet marks had cut up the pitch, but was properly reminded that he could refer to the umpires if ho wished. Tho subject then dropped, e.ud tho celebrated Lancashire bats man commenced to score, pretty freely off Midwinter, till a loud cheer soon announced tho appearance of 100. On 110 appearing Palmer and Giffen went on, and shortly after wards, when another 10 run3 had been added, Palmer got Steel l.b.w., the totals being — 4 — 31 — 120, The dcpnrtnro of Steel was a relief to tho Australians, as he has scored heavily off their bowling, tiiis season on fino wickets. Ulyott shaped very badly at Palmer-, and was canght off him at mid-on after making 10, Bannerman being, as usual, on tho atert for an accident. 5—10 — 136. Barlow, who followed, played Palmer's first hall into the hands of Murdoch at point, tho numbers being -6—0 — 13G. Scotton meanwhile, without making lira least mistake, continued tho stubborn (lefeneeof his wicket, bu t anon lii-intr joined bv Lord Harris cut a full pitch of Palmer's for 4, the Eng lish captain, who started rather badly, 'also cutting Palmer and hit him to leg for 4 each, nnd 3 mere off Giffen, but in Palmer's next over was given .out leg before widket. (Far- rand) off a full toss, 7 — 14 — 1G0, Lyttolton followed, and at lunch time the total was 172, Scotton being credited with 51 and Lyttolton with 3. Soon after resuming, Lyttolton was clean howled by Spofforth, ascribing the dis aster to an occupant of tho motnbors' reserve crossing tlio bowler's arm in front of the pavilion. 8 — 3 — 181. IV. IV. Bead joined Scotton, and at once commenced to scoro by hitting Spofforth to -long-oil for 4, andPatmor to tho off, close to tho ropes. Scotton received a severe blow on tho kneo from Spofforth, but continued his innings, and Bead again operating on Palmor for 4 brought up 200\. His noxt 4, however, was a lucky snick off Spofforth just ont of reach of Blackham, : who had retired to Bhort Blip, but the next halt was lifted clean over the on sido boundary, a splendid hit. With the total at 210, Bead bit one back to Spofforth low down, but was let off, which proved rather on expensive mis take for the Australians, as the crack Surrey batsman from that defied all ahanges of bowling, nnd in two hours and ten minutes complied ono of the host hitting innings evor seon, scoring in that timo no loss than 117 runs. Somo idea of tho rapidity with which he scored may bo gathered from tlio fact that after boing at the wiokots an hour and three- quarters he lmd caught Scotton, who had beon in nearly five hours, and in exactly two hours had compiled his century. Scotton at length succumbed to Giffen, boing caught at forward point by Scott, who had cropt in very closo, and tho left hand batsman was deservedly I cheered for his splendid display of defence. J o — 90 — 332. The ninth wicket had put on 151 runs, and thus destroyed nil chance of the match being finished within the (into. The lost man, Peato, hft Giffen to log for 4, and Bead drove Boylo in ono over for two 4'i and a coupio, but in attempting to pull him off tho log stump was clean bowled, and the innings closed, 10 — 117 — 346. There being an hour to spare the Englishmen followed their innings, boing205rnnsto tho bod, Barlow and Lyttelton being first batsmen, Tho amateur soorod rapidly off both Spofforth and Bovle, but the latter deceived him by ohango of pace, and bowled him with a slow ono. 1 — 17 — 22. Shrewsbury followed, and Bcored eo quickly tbat in 28 minutes from tho start 60 appoored, the new comer delighting the spectators by hitting in good stylo eight 4's oat of his total of 37 ; but inattempting toput Giffon to leg he was smartly canght by Scott at forward short leg, the board Bhowing 2 — 37 — 73\. Lord Harris and Barlow played out time, and at half-past six play ceased, and tho match was drawn, tho Australians boing Btilt 202 runs 1-3 tho good, with two of tho English wicket3 down. Iu tlio second innings, as will bo seen from the analysis, Palmer was tho most snoeessful of tho Australian bowlers, but Murdoch again I think made too little use of Boyle. Mr. Iredale, a standi supporter of Australia cricket, who recently had the ball used against the Gentlemen of England mounted in silver and presented to Blackham, also r.eourod tlio one off whicli Murdooh mado most of his runs in this match, with the inten tion of presenting it to the Australian captaio in r.llogorical mounting. In tho evening, after the termination of the match, the Australians and a party of friends were entertained at dinner at tho Cafd Terry, Regent-street, by Mr. W. H. Jonnings, of Sydney.
