DREAM OF THE ROSE AND THE NIG B TINGALE. (Prom the Athekeum). I dream t l l£y upon a bed Of autumn leafage gold and red, And hearct the passionate nightin f gale t .1 •:- I Reproach the rose in June ; Till from red crimson she turned pa?e. WanerJ than when the j weeping moon ^ Looked down on dead Endymiori • Prom rose to lily she thus ^grew, < 3511 like her own sad ghost she shivered vi. * in the dew. * Ah, foolish one, refrain, refrain, Or by this slight thy love is slain,' My dreaming lips had surely cried; -But1 that the bird, his mistress1 wpund . , Perceiving, such a magic tide Of Sorrow pours that from her " : swound. She lifts her head in dear astound, And back from lily to radiant rose, through f; every true-love tint, her ' blushing beauty goes. t—Alfred Percival Graves.
