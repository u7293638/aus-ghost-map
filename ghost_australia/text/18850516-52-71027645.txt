South Australian Jockey Club. / ' THE CDT DAT.-SATTJBDAY, MAT 9. .' ....... . ' (PBOM " CASPIAK.") '? ' v ' MBIBOUSITB, Saturday» : Postponements, aa a rule, are generally voted a no»1 snccesB; but the committee of the South Australia^. Jockey Club are to be congratulated on a pleasaat terminal tioh, of their Cup Day. The weather was beautiful, an*' everything surrounding the course rofreshimg to gaze upon«] while the track, although a trifle beary, was good flrnfi going. Tho attendance was good, and an improvement oaj the opening day. The racing produced exciting finishes, especially m the Nursery Handicap, when all the f ouï? horses were, heads and tails. The Adelaide Cup produced : the. largest field ever started for that event, namely, seven« teen startors. Proceedings opened with the Maiden Plate, Hampstead being' the publio favorite. Out of the threat runners, the colt ran unkindly, and Capri won easily.' Some good speculation was indulged in over the different "candidates iu tho Nursery Handicap. At ono period Solos ;reaohe'd'8 to 1, then receded to IO to 1, while Delamiá anet Juanna' changed prices with- Arsenal. ' Tho fall of thor .'flag, Delamia had most friends,, but fapad to hoist thai winning 'number' Bemus, a good-looking son of Ganff Forward and Eomula, and fairly supported by* tho! ; stáblé,:' jvori ,Botu>what J easily^ ' while ' Honey comb and Ulalume run a dead- heat for second place, with" Delamia- only beaten' a ' head, Arsenal. being.very, nearly "last. /Since- the institution of the; Adelaide Cup in 1804,. there has 'never been more than fifteen! runners until .the present1 occasion^ when, seventeen ; faced .the starter. At one period- thç Cup distance was two miles, but last . yeo* wh'en:Maltia won it was alterad to one mile and five fur« longs. Strangely enough Conjecture waa first favorite« a similar - position to that occupied this year, ana agám . failing^;most ignominiously.- Early in thy day Welcome Jack was made tho medium of speculations owners accepting, about, ten* thousand at hundreds to five? and six. The New Zoaland horse, although supported, wa* tooibig for racing,'and, devoid, of muscle. Sardius neve* looked better, being big and full of muscle, as his position: in the race testifies." Still, I fancy he' would race bette* 'with a few more gallops. Madcap and Camerino, two real good "handicap, imares, with such noted horsemen . as O'Brien and HaleB, attracted much attention^ but 'were: overburdened -with' weight. Prometheus* although : woll-conditioned, was .as lame as a, cat. GracoDarling had evidently undorgone a strong pro< paration, and the. uncertain Plausible displayed Bigns o£ coming bick to MB spring form. Hazard, the hurdle racer, surprised many by his forward running. * Anchorite pos« sessed a nico mellow appearance, and as good as hands could make him. . Lantern, of .course, was the ohief attraction,, afterhis Goodwood running, and hundreds ofigood judges, looked upon the event as .simply a walk over j but the horse evidently cannot Btay, and would again have won it the .race had been only one mile. Conjecture looked a pioturo of good health and conditions so did Lord "Wilton, whoso owner felt confident that if he only had Lantern to beat, that the race was over bar shouting. * It appears that when Lord Wilton wat coming round the home turn in the Goodwood Handicap", some horse trod on hm, and another galloped on him, * cutting him above tho hock; which considerably interfered, with him. Britisher looked splendid, but I thiuk ho ia still fatty inside. Hobart did not impress me, and ho un V ? fortunately crossed his legs ofter passing tho stand and came down, but did not hurt the boy. Mr. Watson waa j>ocaeioa©d.8ome trouble at tba star I, owing tothe£@o* tióuiraeÉs of Plausible, and continued breaking away of Conjecture, the rider (Moore) of the latter, hoing disquali fied for three months for disobedience at the post. When the flag was lowered the field were beautifully dispatchoJ, Lantern, Hazard, and Conjecture being the quickest to get on their legs. The. first named was nulled ir tock after rounding the river turn, but never further away than third and fourth, holding an excellent position. At \- the sheds, to the consternation of the backers of Conjec ture, she collapsed, when Hazard headed her, then Britisher made his run on the outside amidst the shouts \- from his supporters. Lantern always hung with Lord \- "Wilton, Anchorite, and Sardina. The Ballarat horse ' led round the home turn . and into the straight; . then Lantern joined him. On they came to the distance, when Lord. Wilton forged . ahead, ana won a great race by a little . over a length from Anchorite, Sardius making a great effort in the last ; fifty yards. The win was popular, for Mr. Ellis of . Adelaida is a gentleman, also well known to Sydney circles . JL3 a real straight goer, and deserving success. Fusilier walked over for the selling hurdle race, and the flying , handicap produced pleuty of speculation. Fully a dozen ' horseB out of the sixteen runners supported. For some ' time Gymkhana and Stafford were about best favorites. . ¡The followers of Middlemarch rallied at tho last moment, . and piled on the money, sending him out about best favorite. He justified their confidence by winning cloverly by a length. Miss Mellin running a good second with nicholson in saddle. The results were as follow : ' Maiden Plate, a sweepstakes of 3 sovs each for starters, with 100 sovs added. Weight for age. linnie. Mr. D. S.

In crossing the tan Ulalume, Solo, ' /uanna, Remus, and Delamia were in the front rank, and the favorite aud Candace brought up the rear.

MELBOURNE, Tuesday, Delightful weather, combined with fair attendance, i Characterised the termination of the South Australian Jockey Club Cup Meeting. Tho course was in capital order for racing, while several events produced interesting finishes. Lad? Bobinson and Misa Robinson, with the 'Victorian Government House party, were present ; the farmer lady making the bracelet presentation to Mrs. Dook, at the Bame time expressing a desire that on the .ftoxt ocnajiloTi aaah a presentation, should taca place in Adekids, The Second Hardie Race set tho hall rolling, and produced'or«a cf the most interesting finishes over wit nessed at Flemington, and was simply won hy good horse manship on the part of Corrigan. Echo and Tattler went out about equal favorites. The latter took a liberty with Echo, waiting on him ; and the Ballarat eau di da tu answer ing every call from the distance, won a desperate race by half a head. Lantern and Remus were tho selections for the Ladies* Bracelet. Tho former, with Gallagher, of Sydney, in the saddle, was generally voted a good thing, but weight told in tho last furlong from home, and Remus won cleverly ; Hiles finishing third. Middlemarch burst a blood vessel and staggered home. It is feared that he will not race again for some time. The performance on tho part of the son ot Gang Forward and Romula was a very creditable one. The Steeplechase brought out a field of three starters. Odds were laid on the Ballarat horse. Cole brook, a very handsome son of Horatio, besides being an aeoomnlished jumper. Blackthorn tired in the straight and then the favorite come&wayand; won with consummate ease. First Pop, by King Cole, boat Surprise easily in the Charity Plate. The winner was bought in at the upset price. Titania bolted just before starting, got rid of her rider near the river turn, severely shaking the lad. A field of twenty starters faced the flag for the S. A. J. C. Handicap. Britisher had a slight call over Topaz and Ringwood, while Lord "Wilton, St. John, and Maxie Louise were all more or less supported at 100's to 1. St. John, -who is an own brother * to Trump Toss, always held a good position, and never left the issue in doubt, winning easily by two lengths from Britisher, who jnstmanagedtobeatSt, Lawrence by ahead. Ringwood come very fast, and finished fourth, a neck off Topaz. The time returned was remarkably fast, beating any previous record.
