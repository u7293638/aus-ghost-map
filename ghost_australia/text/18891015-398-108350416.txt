VISITED BY A GHOST.. A YOUXA INDIANA GIEL'S SPECT-EAI. LOVEB. A ghost and spirit manifestation story comes well authenticated from Washington county, Ind. The ghost professes to be ono Riley Mull, who died thirty-eight years ago, aged. 18 years. It came into the Coker family a year ago while Mrs. Coker and her daughter Saliie, aged 15, were sitting in the room by lamplight, and claims to have been attracted by the daughter. Hundreds of people have since gone and witnessed the manifestations of the spirit, which really did some remarkable things. It played an organ wHle the girl worked the bellows, heat a drum, wrote on a slate and talked very intelligently. Strangely enough, it thoroughly objected to profane language, and several tiroes asked those who were present to pray, joining hcartilj in the " amen. " The organ playing, drum beating, &e; , have been done in other houses, where it would have been impossible to have fixed up any apparatus. Sail in Coker, to whom the ghost 6eems to be especially attached, appears to care but precious little for her ghosily lover, and not infrequently goes to sleep during it s visits, while the mother treasures the hours of its visits. Mull, when alive, was her playmate. Pittsburg Dispatch
