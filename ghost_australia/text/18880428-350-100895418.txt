Xabtee' Column* Spoken in Anger. 'Twos but a little word in anger spoken, While proud eyep flashed through bitter, burning tears s But oh, I felt that fatal word had broken The cord of love that bound our hearts for years. Thy tortured face, that long, wild look of sorrow, Like some pale ghost, must haunt me while I live i And yet, how bright, how full of joy the mor row, Had I but breathed one simple word— " Forgive !" I did not hear the tender voice appealing, Nor marked thy anguish when I cried, " De-part 1" Too blind to see thy pitying glance, reveal ing The generous promptings of tliy noble heart. How could I know that faithful heart was ycarniug, Though crushed and wounded to its inmost core, To take me back, like a weary bird return •nK In fear and trembling, when the storm is o'er. " Remember, love, that it may be forever ; To see my face no more by night or day. Be calm, rash heart, think well before we sever, Recall the angry word and bid me stay.*' Dead silence fell; the song-birds hushed their fiinging, " Kuougli," I proudly cried ; " I choose my fate." While even through ray maddened brain kept ringing The death-knell of my love—too late, too late 1 • " Forgive, forgive 1 " I wailed, the wild tears streaming, As, 'mid the moaning trees, I stood alone j "Love, let thy kisses wake me from ray dreaming." Thy pleading voice, thy tortured face, was gone. That angry word, I may recall it never ; For o'er thy narrow grave rank weeds have grown. " Remember, love, that it may be forever." Ab, words prophetic 1 love, had I but known I My looks are gray, my eyes are dim with weeping, Tho face once loved by thee, no longer fair 1 Beneath the daisies thou art calmly sleep ing; There a lone woman often kneels in prayer. Ah, "sweetheart mine, thou art so lowly lying, Thou canst not hear the tearful voice above, That with tho night wind evermore is sigh ing. " I spoke in anger; oh, forgive me, love I " •Fanny Forrester.
