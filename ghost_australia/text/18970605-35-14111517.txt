THE TEMPLE DRAMATISTS. -is The Temple Dramatists Lduaid the Second, the Duchess, of Malfi, Aiden of Faversham, time Man in 'his Humour J. M. Dent and Co. "Do you remember," asks Bridget, in the Essays of Elia, "do you remember the brown suit, which you made to hang upon you till all your friends cried shame upon you, it grow so threadbare and all because of that folio, Beaumont and Fletcher, which you dragged home late at night from Barker's in Coi ont Garden Do you remember how we eyed it for was weeks before we could make up our minds to the purchase a " We have no need now to wear our suits threadbare, or to wait for weeks before we can make up our minds to plunge with reckless extravagance into the purchase of one of the Elizabethan dramatists for the price of the shilling shocker mo can procure some of the masterpieces of Shakspeare's contemporaries, in dainty little volumes, exquisitely bound in olive green, and printed in clear type on the rough paper dear to the book lover with an artistic etching as a frontispiece, and introduction, notes, and glossary by some of the leading scholars of the day It is enough to make Charles Lamb turn in his grave with envy to think of his shivering folios" thus deflected into mignon duodecimo, and arranged sumptuously in purple and fine linen, for the benefit of a faithless and perverse generation, who prefer Ibsen to Shakespeare, and "The Second Mrs Tanqueray " to " The Duchess of Mali! " " Now you can afford to buy any book that pleases j ou," continues Bridget, "but I do not see that you ever bring me home any more old purchases now " She has been lamenting the good old days when they were poor, and a purchase was not a mere purchase as it is now, but a triumph But though the rarity of the acquisi- tion enhanced the pleasure of the connoisseur, and gave a subtle lies our to the first delicious turning over the leaves of the coveted treasure, which the closed and surfeited palate of the pampered modern gourmand can never experience, set after all, the scarcity and costliness of these fine old plays had the disadvantage of reserving them, like port and partridges, as luxuries for the few, while the multitude never tasted these delicacies Perhaps, now that the enterprise of the modern publisher has placed them in this accessible and attractive form within the reach of the most modest purse, The British public may awake to the consciousness that we have other dramatists beside Shakespeare, and be surprised to find that Arden of J eiei sham is not inferior to Zola's latest in tremendous realism For there can he no doubt that, though long known to the students of our Elizabethan drama, AidenofTeienha'n will come as a revelation to the ordinary reader, who will feel, if he have any perception of what is good in literature as Keats felt when he first read Chapman's translation of Homer," hkn some watcher of the silos when a new planet swims into his ken " Like a new planet it swim into the ken of those old w anchors of the Elizabethan skies who were waiting for the glory that was to be, while as yet the darkness was made visible by the faint tinkle of a few lesser lights, and took its solitary station in lone splendour, none knowing from w hose hand it clime Its very perfection has been the despair of critics That such a consummate work of art should have been produced by an unknown hand seems incredible, and yet which of the recognised dramatists could have written it in 159C,ihodato of its publication is In spite of the complete absence of external evidence, and indcfiancoot all internal probability, some scholars, among whom is Mr Swinburne, carried away by the conviction that no one else was capable of writing it, has unhesitatingly assigned it to Shakespeare We should feel inclined to go further, but to draw the opposite conclusion that Shakespeare himself could not have written it-at least in 1 r>n2 Compare its flawless workmanship, its unity of design, its severity of style, its reserve, repression, and concentration, with the diifuhoncs and exulted race of " Venus and Adonis," " Love's Labour's Lost and the " Comedy of Errors," which were Shakespeare's juvenile attempts before 1592 In style it ranks rather with the ' Winter's Tale," one of his latest plays, written some 20 years after, which shows the same studied com- pression of language, the same repudiation o f all accessory and redundant ornament Marlowe could not have written it. There is too much self-repression, too much subordination of the poetic and the romantic to dramatic effect, for " Marley, the Muses' Darling," who, as Drayton sings - t and in him those brave translation things that the first poets had his raptures were All air Hod fire which made his verses clear, for that place mildness still he did return, which rightly should possess a poet's brain There are no raptures, all air and fire, no fine madness, m Arden of Feversham There is none of that amour de I'impossible, that mutinous and insolent striving after the unattainable, that rebels against the limitations of human nature which tired the dead shepherd's passionate spirit There is no bombast, no rhodomontade, none of the " 'trees " vein of mine Ancient We have no "pampered andes of Asm," no "feed and be fat, my fair Cahpohs " Instead of air and fire we have plum earth , instead of this mad- ness sanity and soberness, as of one who is so possessed by the terrors of his theme that he must tiBQ common language to express his meaning It is, as the anonymous author himself describes it in the epilogue, " a naked tragedy " Wherein no IHOd points are foisted in To make it gracious to the car or o o I or simple truth is gracious enough And needs no other points of growing stuff The hand is not the hand of shakespeare, or of Marlowe, much loss of Tculo, or (Jieono, or even of E}d, the author of the Spanish tragedy, though a wild attempt has been made to father on that blood and thunder nielodrumitist a lesenedjud chastened energy of which he was altogether incapable It is the hand of Aeschylus work ing with English in storms, amid the hues of Kent and the sheets of Eluibcthi in London and dressing the old-world trim 16 of Agamemnon, slain by his guilty wife, Clytemnestra, and her craven paramour, together in the style and language of Shakespeare We have the same unity of concep- tion, the same simple way of plot, the same temble concentration of purpose There is the same oppressive atmosphere of assassination, the same dreadful forebodings the agony of suspense, as to the Agamemnon The victim is blinds! hythe Minio Ale and perishes by the same Nemesis which he has himself provoked The plot is simple, and based upon an actual murder as described in ' Hollinshed s Cluouiele ' Alson who was Mayor of Amersham in 1518, was murdered in his own past four by his wife, Alice, with the assistance of her paramour Messrs once a t idea and now a nobleman's steward, and two hind braves Black Will and Shakcbag But this was only the if it is consummation of a sense of attempts made upon the unhappy victim's life, all mysteriously thwarted as if by some Bupcrnntutil intervention, till at last by his hardness and greed he brings upon himself the causes of Bccdc, the sailor, whose ground he wrongfully detained from his needy wife and children, and then the long-delayed doom is precipitated The motto of the play might have been taken from "Macbeth" bad "Macbeth" been written - Withered murder, Alnrumcd by his sentinel the wolf, Whose howls his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, with Tniquin s ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost Webster's " Duchess of Maid " is the story of Italian cruelty and Italian pride as implacable and Britain is that of the grandes in Browning's " My Last Duchess" The young widow, in the famous wooing scene, abating no whit of her dignity and pure from mines, confers her hand on the worthy steward of her household, in defiance of the threats of her haughty brothers Duke Ferdinand and the Cardinal-who covet her possessions For some to no the marriage 18 kept secret, but is ultimately discovered by the subtlety of Beech, a broken down gentleman and returned galley slave, who has been appointed to a position of trust in the Duchess' household by the suspicions brothers to keep a watch upon her conduct Mortified any price and insulted family pride goad the Duke to frenzy, approaching and subsequently developing into madness, while the cooler and more cautious Cardinal is equally inveterate though less violent The story of their remorseless and unnatural revenge, with its terrible retribution, forms the rest of the play Here, too, us in Arden of Feversham, wo sup full with horrors, but they are horrors relief ed by touches of pure pathos We feel pity as well is terror Wo taste the milk of human kindness as well as the gall of fratricidal bitterness Such is that income arable passage where the Duchess, while the executioners are waiting to st. ingle her, commits her children with her dying breath to the care of her woman, in words whose simple pathos lies almost too deep for tears - I pray thee look thou Pay at my little boy ; Rome -jail for his cold, and let the girl Say her prayers ere she sleep Such is the famous line, surcharged with suppressed emotion, uttered by Ferdinand as he gazes on her murdered body Cover her face mine eyes dazzle she died young, And again She and I were twins i And should I die that instant, I had bred Her time to a minute The weird and ghastly scenes in the prison, where the inhuman brothers exhaust every expedient of fiendish invention to drive her into madness by the most exquisite mental tortures, are well known from the famous criticism of Charles Lamb-the dead hand, with her husband's ring upon the finger, put into her hand in the darkness by her brother, the w seen figures of her husband and children, as if dead, dimly revealed in the gloom of the prison, the company of lunatics, brought from the madhouse to sing and dance and rai o outside her lodging, the homemaker, who comes to measure her, while yet alive, for her coffin and the entrance of the executioner, with a coffin, cords, and a bell As Lamb says, in often quoted words, "To move a horror skilfully, to touch a soul to the quick to lay upon fear as much as it can bear, to wean and weary a life till it is ready to drop, and then stop in with mortal instruments to take its last forfeit this only a Webster can do."
