HOME LESSONS. TO THE, EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. ber, Occasion is taken in the discussion of the proposed innovation of setting apart extr i time for preparing home lessons at school, of people airing their grievances!!, whether fancied or real at tho expense of the recognised system of the public schools in this colony We are told that the word master is a misnomer Granted The individuality and independence that stamp the heads of our English public schools do not exist hero, too many of our boys are permitted to dictate to their patients what schools they shall attend what subjects they shall learn, and the method how they shall learn them , they too often Bail into their classrooms in their pride of purse, and overconfident in the power behind the throne, so that really they become themselves masters of the situation. We are reminded that the teacher himself should be held responsible for influences wholly beyond his control Now, Sir, if people have children it in their duty to see that the minds of these are healthily occupied and stimulated in turn b) work and by play, otherwise the mind, naturally recording on itself and feeding on inanition, must either become slothful or mischievous in ductively, then, he whose son gets ill through over indulgence, makes autopsies of dolls, and kills the cat, is to a degree part crop amma Referring to the main question, what should in justice be the length of a working day, how should it be divided, and of what number should the working days of an academic year consist ' There are three elements to be considered, viz -The parent, the pupil, and the master, which, viewed in connexion with the above points, present the difficulties under discussion. in England eight hours may be assumed as the standard of the working day, and proportionately less for youths of delicate constitution or below their teens Here, where our climatic influences are less bracing, and where sports are less regularly indulged in, this pressure is not so well able to be aus tamed , but it is BO Five and a half hours of school work and two and a half of home work, with modifications as to ages of pupils, is the general rule Now, if half an hour were deducted from the home work and added to half an hour of the school, still clear time would thereby be gained at school to tide over all difficulties council ted with the next day's ensuing lessons But such an arrangement ought not to act as a bar to throwing every pupil upon his own resources for an hour or more every day. At this point the obligations of both pupil and parent begin the one in reflection and in victim of Ina work, the other in exercising a general oversight in seeing that this is done Re possibility then attaches all round, and cannot consistently be shelved The holiday question has again cropped up. Ten weeks in a year is not too long Some contend for longer, others (a few) for none at all The greater portion of this holiday should, I hold be spent at Christmas, when the season of the year tends to prostrate the mental faculties These terms are usually the plague of paterfamilias, but they should be the occasion of affording youth so much healthful recreation 01 congenial and more strained occupation as possible They should be the golden opportunity seized for developing the finer sensibilities of a lad in the family circle and promoter his happiness by outside surroundings Here the parent is responsible to a very important degree The work following a well spent holiday doubly repays both parent and son The question recently brought forward at home, " Are we not paying too dearly for the excessive brain work expended by omitting to brace up the nerve centres by sufficient relaxation.' may be pertinently asked of me Masters of Schools to have their detractors who view their calling in a very rosy light, and will not admit that their position labour as an unenviable one as that of any other class in the colony To sit in judgment upon written work- to catechise, explain, excuse, reprove-to be the butt of caprice, and often of temper-to toil on and on without even knowing when the pace IS to slack-and year after year to roll the same stone up the same monotonous incline are, to a conscientious teacher, the most harassing and trying ordeals as a means to a livelihood, and yet many would deny him the means of recruit- ing his energies, and would trot him like an old cab horse to death If, Sir, all work has to be done at school, and young hopeful has the rest of the day to himself, there will eventuate one of two things, we shall have to convey his mental pabulum to him in the shape of pap, and thus beget a mental mollusc, or else to cram him until his mind de- velops into a knotty crustacean, there creating opportunities of indulging him ID those gay and festive proclivities BO graphically depicted by your late correspondent It the tenor of my nose is too aggressive, pray condemn it, if too prolix, consign it to that receptacle in the editorial sanctum, the waste paper basket I trust, however, that these important points, so persistently at times being raised will have their ghosts 1 led to the satisfaction of all concerned once and for aye -Your, see , DIDASKALOS April 2. at TO THE EDITOR OF THE AEQUO. Sir,-Will you allow me the privilege of my sex to have a last word on this subject I Your correspondent Mr Way, says that no work should be given to a boy for which he has a right to ask for explanation ' But such work is given I am then. other of six sons, and have had experience of many schools in and near Melbourne From every one of them (except the state schools) have my boys brought home lessons requiring help or explanation Those of my sons who have left school acknowledge the value of such help, and I BBO that my children get beyond others, quite as gifted, whose parents do not trouble themselves to have School of an evening Mr Way says " The master in charge of an evening school is not besieged with questions He must remember, in a school then are many boys doing the same lessons, and they help each other, while, in a family, every child is in a different class, and doing ditTeronl work For example, my boy has to learn the names of the counties in England and Wales with their chief towns and rivers. Being Australian born and bred, his ear is quite unfamiliar with these names, and they have not been read over to him at school How can he get through such a lesson with out hope Mr Way Bays -"Patients who have just cause should complain to the headmaster who will then look after his assistants , but surely it is his province to control their zeal or their laziness without the interference of parents, who will endure much before they complain of a teacher, who can make their boy suffer for what he is him self at least partly to blame If the headmasters would engage more assistance, so as to subdivide the classes, and would abstain from giving so much writinG, work to be done at home such as Burns, exercises, and maps-I think parents would be satisfied and thankful They could send their children earlier to bed, so that they could see earlier and learn their lessons in the morning, if those IOBHODB do not require pens and ink things terribly in the way of the housemaid before break fast I have already suggested that schools should commence at 0 instead of half-past I would far rather hasten my domestic arrangements than have my evenings rest destroyed, and see my tired husband worried to do what he fancies he is paying the schoolmaster to do All that has been said on the subject of home lessons should apply equally to girls' schools, but I think women are less conservative than men, and schoolmistresses will be quicker to adopt a system which will serve their own interests Already I have heard of a girls' school in one of the suburbs which is rapidly in creasing in numbers, cruelly because there are few lessons given to the pupils to be done -Yourang, at home.
