MONDAY, JULY, 1882. As this colony is about to increase its indebtedness by placing a loan of £4,000,000 on the London money market, and must within the next three years arrange for the conversion of debentures to the value of nearly £8,000,000, English capitalists will naturally take pains to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with our financial position and prospects. It will be remembered that when Mr. BERRY'S GO vernment fell in June, 1881, he left a deficit of £511,000, notwithstanding the fact that during his term of office, he had placed taxes on land, live stock, , cheques, receipts, promissory-notes, and deeds, colonial beer and tobacco, and also largely increased the protective and other duties levied by the Customs authorities. The position of affairs at the end of the financial year which has just closed is, we are happy to say, very different. The natural conditions which I have characterised that period have not been favourable to the creation of wealth The country has suffered from a severe drought, which has seriously diminished the profits of the agriculturist and the sheep farmer But notwithstanding these drawbacks, we have had a season of undoubted property "We have participated in the advantages attending the revival of trade throughout the world but this in itself would not have accounted for the activity which has been displayed in every branch of commerce and industry A great part of the iuipio\eiiiont observable is owing to the absence of political duration The chief merit of Sir BRYAN O I Oui "INS Administration in its entire freedom from sensational nonsense Hitherto it has been lead sober, quiet, and unobtrusive People have not been harassed by revolutionary tin eats, 01 distracted by vague fears what may happen Peace his begotten confidence in the minds of traders and can italists, and confidence has kindled a spirit of enterprise which has furnished 1 employment for all classes, and a idol considerably to the capital of the our munity The revenue returns which appear in our summary for Europe show the effect upon the public income of a twelve months steady and uninterrupted 1 labour It has been the lot of the present 1 re silver to flame two estimates of the pro- ible receipts during 1881 82-one when he made his financial statement in New tom her last and one in May, when he submitted his Budget scheme for the t velvet months commencing on the 1st instant It is satisfactory to find that b ith of Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN forecasts have been exceeded by the actual results The following figures show the two estimates and the sums brought t book - Custru s _ Hiette To sale at public works Porte a d 1 arbor ra Pottage and the graph Les I lies 1 11 0 Out 673 00 ST 5-100 1 007 iOO "1 000 7800 101 000 J UM loSOIl 1 710 OOOi 1 (J JMJ 100 82 200 i sir so I am 90 10 1 1 3 0 IJ "(I 170 ill 160 21 000 111 00 1 100 17 £31 503 "ST 5 in 7 It will be seen that the total sum received exceeded the first estimate by £317,212, and the second by £20 to 2 The increases are principally in connexion with items which depend for their productiveness on the consuming powers of the people and the activity of trade Information on this pou t m 1} be obtained by reference to the summary Throughout the past ) e 11 we have been still labouring, of cotton under the load of fresh taxation which Mr. LEPRA found it necessary to import in order to repair the waste caused by his political manoeuvres and extravagant expenditure It is satisfactory however, to find that at last the buiuVus placed upon the industry of the country for the purpose of meeting deficits caused by recklessness and tenacity are answering the purpose for which they were imposed, and are also she A nig signs of healthy elasticity The total receipts during the financial year which has just closed were £0 obS 756 against £5,115,121 in 1880 81, the increase being 111 round numbers £17 1000 This is the largest amount paid into the Treasury during any one year up to the present time the income in 1679 80 was£4,554,252 1878 79, £1 510 120 1877 78, £1,185,411 the increase in the recent to which we have referred will modify to some extent the finance account submitted to the Assembly about a month ago The new statement will be as follows - nvAî,cisl8fc2 3 Balance from 1881 2 If authored revenue Receipts from loan account Estimated expenditure to 030 400 open at appropriations £1 438 UJ Votes 4 115 98 -5 57107.) Balance to 1883 4 02 JSi £5 030 400 As a matter of fact the balance brought forward to 1882 i will exceed the sum put down, £99,249 The law allow, pay meats to be made up to the end of August on account of services rendered or goods supplied before June 30 The probable amount required for that purpose is included in the finance statement, but actual disbursements seldom come up to the provision made. However, if eventually we bring no more forward to 1882 5 than the £100 000 shown in the account, the affairs of the financial year 188182 will be wound up satisfactorily It must be remembered that not only was the instalment due last October of the half million borrowed by Mr BERRY on Treasury bonds to cover his deficiency paid off in the regular course, but very nearly the whole of the balance was liquidated in advance out of current revenue In other words, our floating debt, which at the commencement of 1881 82 stood at £500,000, was reduced during that year by a sum of about £472,000 This, added to the balance brought forward to 1882 83, shows a surplus revenue during 1881 82 of no less than £572,000 In view of this surplus the Government proposed to abolish the duty on tea (3d per lb ), to reduce the duty on colonial beer from 2d to 4d per gallon and to establish a penny postal rate throughout the colony, in place of the twopenny charge at present imposed Owing to the opposition offered by the Constitutional party to remissions which its members did not think justifiable under existing circumstances, the Government has modified its proposals While still adhering to its view with respect to the advisability of freeing tea from duty, it has consented to leave that impost untouched The reduction in postage will be put off to 1st July, 1883, and the beer duty is to be abolished altogether The first concession has our entire approval As to the second, we need only say that we object to financial legislation in advance The determination to abolish an easily collected and productive tax like that on colonial beer, is, we think, a great mis- take The result of the constitutionalists interference will to some extent prevent the immediate sacrifice of revenue contemplated by Ministers, and should the estimates of income be realised, the balance to be carried forward to 1883 4 will be considerably larger than the amount shown in the statement we have furnished Of course the productiveness of the revenue will depend in a great measure on the preservation of political peace ten days ago there seemed every probability of a Ministerial crisis, but matters have settled down again under circumstances which give Sir BRYAN OLooiiii-NS Administration a better chance of weathering the dangers of the session than it had recently Of course, when the souls of numerous politicians are athirst for office, it is impossible to say what a day may bring forth But our creditors, and those who think of beer ming so, may rest assured that whatever changes take place, it will be many years before any trading politician can again fill the ide which Mr. British played in 1877-8 ') with such disastrous LOiiPequences to the finances of the colony. The recollection of his reign of tenor in immature is too vivid at present to admit of a repetition Ilia people would not tolerate any attempt to renew the performance Just it pro sent there are no burning questions to arouse class passions, and rival parties are at their wits end to find subjects on which they can alike The fact that we have forced our way through many and great difficulties without damage to our institutions, and have secured a season of rest in spite of politicians who live by strife and agitation, should beget confidence in our future, and procure for the colony all the assistance it needs for the development of our great resources on the terms granted by English capitalists to "the most favoured ' nations The Victorian politics of the day are a dreary study for our English readers There is one exception, however, to the record of folly and of faction, and that is the general support given to the Government proposition to hasten the completion of our defence works, in view of any complications consequent upon the Egyptian situation Our in terest in the Suez Canal is so great, that naturally current events attract unusual attention here Prudent men and the vendors of panic stones alike join in the conclusion that is the defences are about to be put upon a new and solid footing, the more speedily the work is accomplished the better Under these circumstances, the Treasurer last week, in submitting a temporary Sup_ by Bill, asked for in adv mee of 600 000 for defence cape The bulk of the money goes towards the construction of the for it, but the vote was proposed and was in cepted as expressing approval of the modified Jervois scheme submitted by the Treasurer in his budget statement the dominant idea of the scheme is that Melbourne e shall be defended by ckfeinCj to an enemy the entrance of the channels leading from inside the Heads to her son's Bay Port Phillip pre nuts a magnificent expanse, but its waters are not deep The passage from the Heads to the city can only be made by certain channels which have their mouths in the shoals and islands spreading from side to side of the land locked gulf immediately below Queens cliff A battery on Swan Island, near the western shore, commands the West Channel, and a fort to be constructed on the shoals will come mind the South Channel, and the occurrence of these channels will be laid with torpedoes, so as to prevent a foe running the gauntlet of the guns The Swan Island battery 13 practically completed, and 100 pound guns are now being mounted Some years must elapse before the South Channel fort is erected, and in the meantime we must rely upon our floating defences for the covering fire to protect the South Channel torpedoes from displacement The bodies of the Courts have been so far repaired that the ironclad can now steam her seven or eight knots, and she is declared to be ready to go into action And properly manned and commanded, this powerful turret non clad should be able to render a good account of herself, and should hold safe any ordinary foe In addition, Ministers have now obtained permission from the Assembly to telegraph to Great Britain for two gunboats, one of the Eps Ion to pe-fast vessels carrying heavy guns, and able to work among the shallows Two fast torpedo boats for aggressive purposes are also to be obtained Thus we shall have a small but efficient flotilla, having the ironclad as its centre But until the gunboats are here, and until the fort is built, the defence of the port must rest entirely on the Cerberus, on her crew, and on her officers, and consequently too much attention cannot be paid to the vessel and her condition A word more must be said on the subject later on. The Assembly has also authorised the Government to correct the two great errors committed by the Berry Ministry, in connexion with the defences fire permanent artillery corps, which was disbanded last year, is to be re- organised, so as to provide a body of trained gunners for the heavy ordnance now being placed in position, and the land torpedo corps to take charge of the submarine mines in the channels-is to be reconstructed The necessary funds have been specially voted in each instance With the opening of the new year, the existing volunteer corps will be replaced by a volunteer militia, who will be required to set apart certain days for drill, and who will be paid for their services What remains to be provided for is the command of the forces we are creating So far Ministers have not committed themselves to any definite scheme, nor were they pressed for a decision when the emergency vote was before 1 House But later on, when the de i departments come to be dealt with, I will have to explain their intention.) There is no doubt as to the views of the force and of the community Never was confidence here so complete as w" in the volunteers were under the command of Colonel PITT, who left us for active service as military secretary to General CAMERON in one of the New Zealand campaigns The corps we are ill equipped, but it was felt that they were efficiently led, and that that was more than half the battle The desire is that the system of Imperial command should be re- e'tabVlied-that a number of Imperial officers should be " seconded " for special service in connexion with the local volunteer forces as they are in connexion with the volunteers of Great Britain It is urged that the colonel command ant should be an officer so detached foe [ a stated period of service, that he should be his adjutants, and that there should be at least two staff college officers charged with the instruction of the officers of the local corps Our volunteer officers are aware of their own deficiencies, and it is to their credit that they do recognise their weakness, and that they desire that the means should be provided to enable them to work up to the highest possible standard This is a proof that we have the right men in the right place Colonel SCRATCHLEY says in his evidence before the Royal Commission, Sydney-" My experience " in Australia points to the fact that " volunteer officers are, as a rule, only " too anxious to learn I am convinced " that it is only necessary to afford " them facilities for so doing, and the " result would be highly satisfactory This remark will be endorsed by all who know the officers It is their wish that the officers of command and of instruction should be obtained from England on the short service principle, in order that they may be thoroughly posted by these teachers in the latest developments of arms, tactics, and strategy They wish that their men should feel confidence in them, and they seek a professional staff in whom they can place confidence themselves. The declaration in favour of the principle of Imperial command is so strong that we may expect that applies cation will be made to HIS MAJESTY S Government to detach the officers required for the purpose Indeed, Colonel HUTTON, the acting commandant of the volunteer force, only accepted the post on the understanding that his appointment would be tempo my There may be greater difficulty in applying the principle to the naval command than there is to the land corps, on account of personal influences, but, to say the least, the system is as sound in the one case as the other The short service principle must be as necessary afloat as ashore, if only for the reason that changes with the torpedo, the ram and the gun, are as rapid as the altera- tion in rifles and field pieces and strategy And as LITR Al v a. TY has a powerful squadron in these waters, it would be easy from the practical stand point, to link our service with the great and historic naval service of Great Britain A strong recommendation to this effect has been made by Admiral NEILSON, to whose views the utmost deference is to be paid And so soon as the issue is debated and understood, we may expect that Admiral WILSON viz recommendation will be endorsed, and its adoption insisted upon by public opinion By last mail the shipowners of Great Britain and other maritime countries were placed in possession of the new rates for pilotage in Victorian waters which recently received the sanction of the Governor in Council Of late years a great deal has been done to improve the harbours of Port Phillip Bay, and to pre- vide accommodation for shipping "While these efforts have been duly appreciated by visitors, it has always been maintained that the port charges are too high that they constitute a heavy tax on vessels carrying freight or under engagement, and repelling vessels wanting to refit 01 seeking emplt yment The Chamber of Commerce here his long been impressed with the necessity of relieving shipping from a portion of its burdens, and at the commencement of the current year a sub-committee which had been appointed to investigate the subject, reported strongly in favour of that course The report was accompanied by a table showing the charges on a sailing vessel of l,e)00 tons register visiting Melbourne, Adelaide or Sydney respectively The comparative statement was as follows:- Tomago defeat J Pilotage to and 19 per ton £75 O 18 d per ton 1,31 6 12 0 £103 6 £13 5 Sydney £31 0 IS Note-The Ben oil cargo at Melbourne in subject to a reduction not exe edict, 6d per ton each way vi on the services of a steam tug are engaged and in Adelaide the reduction IB 23 per cent. The report, amongst other recommendations, suggested that the Commissioner of Trade and Customs and the Pilot Board should be urged to take the necessary steps to reduce the charge for pilotage, as that could be done by a simple resolution approved by the Governor in Council That proceeding was vigorously opposed by those whose interests were affected The pilots pointed out that the conditions of the service required at Port Phillip Heads are altogether different from those under which the work is carried out at the other Australian ports Pilot vessels capable of keeping the sea in all weather for days together are needed here, and to provide the necessary appliances, pilots joining have to put in about £400 as their share of the plant At Sydney and Adelaide the work of pilot mg is carried on without moving far from the base of operations It was further urged that the table put forward by the sub-committee of the Chamber of Commerce was misleading, as it took no notice of the different distances traversed within the respective pilotage waters Taking these into consideration, and still basing our calculations on a vessel of 1,500 tons register, we arrive at the following results - "I the line at I r J> Icblilo E hat Lrt accretion of Zealand (navy port) instant (I v ron) DIStance Within Pilotage Watora 113 35 S 0 10 3 It is apparent, therefore, that if tried by mileage test, pilotage at Melbourne was lower, under the old rates, than at my other Australian port, Launceston alone excepted But notwithstanding all the reasons that could be given why pilotage should be more costly in Victorian waters than at other Australian ports, the fact he trained that A vessels coming here had to pay a larger lump sum than they were charged elsewhere With a A few, there fore, to render Port Phillip more attractive to shipping, it was determined, after much consideration and discussion, to make reductions in the rates The revised scale, which appears in another column, came into operation last Saturday Under it a sailing ship of 1,500 tons register, piloted from without the Heads to Melbourne or Geelong, and vice versa, will pay 5d per ton each way, or 368 15s in and out, instead of £75 as formerly. The maximum charge is put at £45 each way, and the mmi mum at £6 Removes within Hobson's Bay are to be 4d per ton, with a maximum of 66, and a minimum of £1, so that vessels of 1,500 tons and upwards will pay the same as at present The charge for steamers from or to the pilot ground outside the Heads will hereafter be 3d per ton instead of Vd, with a maximum of £30 each way and a minimum of £4 The reduction of the maximum rate for steamers from £31 10s to £30 each way will be a considerable boon to the large liners which now command such a large proportion of our trade. Owing to the expensive nature of the Port Phillip service, it is questionable whether any further concessions can be made to shipowners in connexion there with, but we hope that before long the Government will be able to lower the tonnage dues from Is to 6d This would give sensible relief, and be the means, doubtless, of making this port a popular place of resort for many purposes The colony might lose a little at first by the change, but it would soon recoup itself through the greater activity of all trades connected with shipping, and the reductions which might reasonably be expected in the cost of ocean carriage. The letter of Mr JOHN PENDER, chairman of the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company, replying to complaints which had been made as to delays in the transmission of cable messages from Europe to Australia, has already been referred to and its statements answered There is one portion of the communication, however, to which it is desirable to make further allusion In explaining how the cable service is managed, Mr PINDER points out that there are two principal routes for cable messages one as Suez and one via Teheran, which are used by the Extension Company and the Indo European Company in common, and whichever line is working best is chosen for the trans- mission of messages It is optional, of course, for the press and the public to direct their messages to be sent by either route, and they should have for their guidance whatever information is procurable as to which is the better route of the two A ready way of acquiring this information would be to take note of the time occupied by the telegrams in transmission, but this is rendered impossible, because, in the first place, of the errors made in recording the time at which messages are despatched from London, and, in the second, because the route by which the messages come is not marked on the telegrams We believe that the regulations of the service provide for identification of route, but 13 far as this end of the line is concerned, the telegrams furnish no evidence as to the way by which they come It may fairly be asked that in structions should be given to remedy this defect Again, persons who receive telegrams in Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide have no means of knowing whether their messages have left London late or early as compared with other telegrams At Bombay and other Indian stations this information is supplied by a daily return giving the date and hour of the latest message transmitted from London. No such information is given in Australia, but if it could be obtained it would be exceedingly useful The points to which we have referred are deserving of the attention of the company The chairman had expressed a desire to make the service acceptable in every way, and we may hope, therefore, that the improvement asked for will not be refused Egyptian affairs still continue to furnish the chief topics of interest in the European telegrams At the conference sitting at Constantinople the powers with the exception of England are favourable to a compromise with Arabi Pasha the Egyptian leader Englandlacontinmngber preparations for war and twenty thousand troops drawn half from Great Britain, and half from India, are being got ready for the occupation, if he cessary; of 3 gypt In England the House of Commons is engaged on the Repression Bill designed to stop the murderous outrages now so common in Ireland It has passed the measure through committee, but only succeeded in doing so after a continuous sitting of 32 hours, and the suspension of the more obstructive of the Irish members At the annual dinner of the Cobden Club an association devoted to the propagation of the principles of free trade Lord Derby and Lord Kimberley drew comparisons between New South Wales and Victoria Mr Murray Smith, the new agent general for Victoria made his first public appearance in London on this occasion, and was well received Sir Henry Parkes has completed his European tour, and sailed for Australia on Saturday by the steamship John Elder 'the execution of Guiteau, the murderer of President Garfield took place according to the terms of his sentence, on Friday? last, the 30th June It was on the 2nd July last year that he committed the crime, but it was not till the 19th of the following September that his victim died During the long illness of President Garfield the exasperation of the Americans against Guiteau was very great and plots were formed to take his life On September 11 a little more than a week before the President died Sergeant Mason, of the 2nd Artillery, fired at him while the guard was being changed, but without effect Mason, on being arrested, declared that the guard had cast lots to determine who should shoot the prisoner, and that the lot had fallen on him. The trial of Guiteau before the Criminal Court of the district of Columbia began on the 11th November and another attempt was made on his life five days afterwards as he was being conveyed from court to the gaol A man named Wm Jones, who was afterwards said to have been insane, stepped out from the crowd of spectators and deliberately fired twice at Guiteau, the second shot granting the prisoner a wrist Soon after the commencement of the trial, a theory was set up that the prisoner was insane The proceedings were accordingly suspended, and a committee of experts examined Guiteau They pronounced him perfectly sane on the 13th December, and the trial went on till the 20th January, when the jury brought in a verdict of guilty An application for a new trial was made to the judges of the Supreme Court and refused, and Guiteau was formally sentenced to death on the 4th of February, his execution being fixed for the 30th June After sentence had been passed, Fresh efforts were made by the prisoner a friends on his behalf, but they were unsuccessful, and Guiteau, 12 months after the murder, has paid the penalty of his crime I A fair amount of business is likely to be done in Parliament this week Very little remains to be said about the re- enactment of the excise duty on tobacco, and a vote will doubtless be taken on the Treasurer a resolutions tomorrow evening The Government hope to make progress with the Railway Construction Bill and the Land Bill The debate on the second reading of the latter measure has not been resumed Since Mr Madden explained its provisions several weeks ago On Wednesday evening, after half-past 9 o'clock Mr Wrixon will be afforded an opportunity to move the adoption of new rules recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, for the purpose of pre vendors members from abusing so frequently; as they do at present the privilege they pea sees of raising impromptu debate on a motion for the adjournment of the House Last session an order was in force requiring) a member to produce six supporters before he could move the adjournment, and restrict ing the discussion to one specific subject. It is proposed to revive the order, at the same time increasing the number of members! required to support such a motion to 10 The committee also suggest that question should not be put to Ministers until after the orders of the day have been disposed of. According to the existing practice, question! have precedence of all other business, and it is usually with the intention of debating answers given by Ministers that members move the adjournment of the House The motion is sometimes proposed to obtain answers to questions of which notice has not been given The revenue returns, as compared with the financial statement delivered by the Treasure! on May 30, show a surplus of receipts over estimated expenditure amounting to £98,000 It has been pointed out to us by the Treasurer that there is a probability of the surplus being still greater, as some votes for 1881-2 are cor tamtolapBe. Under the Amended Audit Act, passed at the instance of Mr Service, unexpended balances do not lapse until the 30th August The exact expenditure under the estimates for 1881 2, therefore, will not be known until two months hence, when the final accounts are made up About £10,000 will probably lapse, or in official language be saved," increasing the surplus to £108 000 The Treasurer desires us to correct the error which several country journals have fallen into respecting the exact amount of the available surplus Nominally speaking, the revenue has exceeded the authorised expenditure by £403,000, but a deduction (which they have overlooked) has to be made on account of £300 000 worth of Treasury bills which were retired by the Government before they became due. AB the accounts stand at present, the available surplus is £98,000 Saturday was the anniversary of the separa- tion of the colony from New South Wales It was observed as a holiday at the Government offices, the banks, the law courts, and a considerable number of semi-public establishments , but otherwise there was not much distinction given to the day The race meeting at Caulfield, the coursing at Sunbury, and the various football matches were well attended The Government steamer Despatch is to proceed again to day to the Swan Island for tifications with the third of the 300 pounder guns and other material required at the island for defensive purposes On her return to Hobson's Bay she will be placed on the Government slip for overhaul and any neco3 Bar) repairs, after which she will take stores to the lighthouse keepers, and see whether the buoys and moorings at the smaller ports are in good order The directors of the Tasmanian Steam Navigation Company have intimated to the secretary of the Marine Engineers Institution, that the request for a third engineer to be placed on the company s steamers running between Tasmania and Sydney has been complied with, the directors believing that this course will be advantageous to all concerned The Adelaide Steamship Company has also complied with a similar request, and in some of their boats, in addition to a third engineer being placed on board, an increase of pay has been given to those previously employed. The race meeting of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club, held at Caulfield on Saturday last, proved, notwithstanding the threatening weather, a great success, a large company Thronging the stand and lawn The racing proved exceptionally interesting, the finishes in most instances being close and exciting The principal event of the day, the Ladies Trophy, fell to Glad Tidings, a horse which ran in the nomination of Mrs A W Sullivan The victory of Glad Tidings was a great But prise, his name never being mentioned in the betting No fewer than 34 horses faced the starter, and the spectacle was a most brilliant one Tall particulars of the various events appear in another column Mr Archibald Forbes returned to town on Saturday after a months tour, which embraced Geelong, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Sandhurst, and other large towns To night, in the Atheneum hall, he will commence the course of four lectures promised at the close of his brilliant season at the Opera house. The fourteen million fighting men of Europe, the great commanders of the age, Britain s military strength for offensive and defensive purposes these are among the subjects which will be treated of in this course of lectures At the present moment it would be difficult to find more interesting topics, while it would certainly be impossible to find a lecturer more capable of handling them than " the famous war correspondent and critic A correspondent whose letter was published on Friday, has called attention to the fact that a line of railway is being surveyed from Brighton Beach Station to Cheltenham by way of the Brighton Esplanade, which is thus threatened with a serious encroach- ment On inquiring at the Railway department, we learn that this is one of four different trial routes which have been surveyed 'The Brighton and Cheltenham extension is included in the Railway Construction Bill now before Parliament, but no special route has yet been chosen It is likely that the inhabitants of Brighton, and the thousands of persons who are in the habit of visiting the Esplanade on holidays and on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, will protest against any portion of the area set apart for public recreation being appropriated by the Railway department Several important measures will be laid before the members of the University Council at their ordinary meeting this evening Professor M'Coy has given notice of his intention to move that a committee, consisting of the Bishop of Melbourne, Dr Hearn, Dr Bromby, Dr Morrison, Dr. Mackay, and the mover, be appointed to consider the question of assimilating the offices of chancellor and vice chancellor to the corresponding offices in the home universities, with the object of freeing the chancellor from the chairmanship, and from the di S charge of oil routine duty, of opening the chancellorship to persons outside the council, of enlarging the busts of voting for the election of chancellor, and of attaching a salary to the office of vice chancellor. Dr Morrison will move that all meetings of the council be open to the press, a proposition which some time ago was submitted to the council and resolved in the negative In view of recent events, however, it has been thought desirable to allow the council another oppor- tunity of discussing this matter The Right Rev. the Bishop of Melbourne (Dr Moorhouse) preached yesterday morning at St George's Church, Royal park, in aid of the fund for the building of a parsonage which is to cost about £700. Before yesterday the sum of £250 had been received or was promised towards the required amount The bishop had a very numerous congregation Having commended the object to which the offertory was to be applied, the bishop preached from the text (21st verse of Luke, 17th chapter)-" Neither shall they say, Lo here, or Lo there,' for behold the Kingdom of God is within you There were, he said, many really learned men in the present day who know about the Word of God little more than euperatitiouB old wives did of fables and accounts which they had heard in the nursery He said this out of charity to them, because if it were not so it would be totally impossible to explain the ridiculous mistakes into which they were continually falling In the days when these learned men were young the ordinary Christian would tell them that the Gospel came to teach them the way to heaven, and if questioned further hewonldprobablysoy that the end of his labour, and the object of his hopes beyond this world, was the getting to heaven. No wonder that that was regarded as a mean and contemptible Christianity " another worldliness " That, however, was New Testament teaching. The Kingdom of God was not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. The Kingdom of God within a man consisted in the regulation of his feelings, impulses, thoughts, words, and deeds, so that his life was animated and ia expired by love to God and man. Heaven was not a place merely-it was the state of the soul towards God, and if a man tried to get it as a reward, and merely from selfish motives, that act about it out from him, for that belonged to the opposite of the Kingdom of God not to Heaven, but to Hell Yesterday the annual collections in aid of the Pope were made in all the Roman Catholic churches of the city and suburbs A pastoral letter issued by the Archbishop of: Melbourne was read by the officiating clergy- men, in which it was asserted that in consequence of " the Holy Father have been deprived of his ancient patrimony, by fraud and violence, ' this animal appeal to the faithful throughout the world had become a matter of urgent necessity. Accompanying the pastoral was a note from Cardinal Simeon, prefect of the Propaganda, acknowledging on behalf of Pope Leo the receipt of £720, being the total sum contributed last year from the arch' diocese of Melbourne This amount does not include the collections in the diocese of Ballarat, or the diocese of Sandhurst, both of which were forwarded independently to Rome by their respective bishops Archbishop Goold presided at the 11 o'clock mass in St Patrick's Cathedral yesterday, and imparted the Pontifical benediction The officers of the Australian Alliance Assurance Company on Friday afternoon assembled in the board room to say " good' bye' to the actuary, Mr, C J. Lucas, on his retiring from the company's service, Before doing so, Mr E S. Watson, the manager, said he had much pleasure in presenting to Mr Lucas, in the name of him, self and fellow officers, a silver tea service and salver, which they asked him to accept in token of the high esteem in which he was held by the entire staff They all hoped he would speedily regain his health, and wished him every success in his future career. Mr. Lucas replied in a few words. The centre of the salver contained the following inscription " Presented by the manager and officers of the Australian Alliance Assurance Company to Chas J Lucas, Esq , T I. A on the occasion of his resignation as actuary to the company Melbourne, 30th June 1882 " A correspondent calls attention to an instance of seeming laxity in the manner in which observations are made at the signal stations along the coast. It is pointed out that the s s Penola, which arrived in the bay on Saturday, was telegraphed from all the stations in the ordinary course, while the a a Claud Hamilton, which followed the former steamer, and arrived soon after her, was not heard of until her arrival in the bay On the 7th June we published a letter signed "Veritas containing the following statement -"As no inquiry appears to have been made in reference to the appointment of an uncertificated head teacher to a good school at Yarram Yarram during, or just subsequent to the election for Geelong, and as the teacher himself makes no secret of the fact that this is the first day school of which he has had charge, and that his appointment was secured by the member for whom be worked well and successfully during the Geelong election, it might be well for the commission to give this case a little attention.
