It is his duty to caution you ; but as a matter of fact there are plenty of safe swindles: which: can be shown up; and winch it is good business to show up : : Of' course you take a certain amount of risk, but it is worth it; and I don't think; with ordinary common sense, / you need be very apprehensive as to any ruin overtaking you' because you show up the. gentlemen who are the pick- pockets of the financial world.'• THE -EDlTOit OF THE " INVESTORS' RE- It is more than ten years , since I had the pleasure of wovlung -witli Mr.' A, :T.
