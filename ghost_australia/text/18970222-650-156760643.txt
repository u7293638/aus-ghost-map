I was incessantly! shivering and shaking -. and could neither eat or .sjeep. On (the, 2'8rdi March -last -I saw a. well known doctor, and he told me that my case was utterly hopeless. However, he gave me an order to_ the,, Director of Charitable Institutions?' 'Did you make use of the order?' 'No;-I caine : home jafid;; went 5tp, bed, and .!hay^(^a-n!J pretty weilUnf bed everi since, a ive wee&s; ago 1 could not walk across the floor; in, fact, I could qpt get ontof bed.^I. felb'theh that it was ail over with me, and only a question of days when I would give up my ghost, My .doctor was attending me, and did all he could, by opium and morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. ,, I was under him for five or six weeks.- 'He came to the conclusion that I was suffering from locomotor ataxia or progreasive, locomotor ataxy, a disease of the spinal cord, characterised by peculiar disturbances of gait and' difiScufty' in co-ordinating vol untary movements. He told me that I nrightlast for ten years, and that; i, might never ! get 'the use of my legs. (Just then the .patient kicked, his legs abont witlfenergy to show that medical opinion is not infallible.) Well, just as a drowning man will grasp at straw,I grasped at an idea conveyed by the adver tisement describing the cure effected in the case of another boiler-maker in England, which I read in the 'Australian Workman,'by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills For Pale People.' il read the advertise-, ment of a case which .seemed to fit mV own. I aetermioed to give Pink Pills a trial anyway, and sent for box. The effect was as marvellous as it was magical I was able to eat and sleep as though nothing was the matter with me, v' was the first appetite and rest X h\ xt many a day. It woB;iaor''*' u ad for immediately left the bs^.. editable.

You see those crntchesliere?. They. were made. before I got Dr. -Williams' Fink pills, but I was too weak too use them, and now I don't want them. All I want' is this stick, and. I hopa soon to do without it. You see I am rapidly regaining my strength.' 'He is 100 per cent, better, said Mrs JarviSj who had come in and taken the baby on her knees.' 'Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have saved his life, and.made another man of him.' A friend who called in at this point, said that Jarvis looked ten years younger that day than he did a fortnight pre viously. 'I can now, continued Jarvis, 'have a cold bath, and all the feeling has come back in my legs. -If I keep on going the way I amy I hope to be able to re j'aume swork , af boiler-maker, jfatidrybu ??KniQw.Xi.bttTex:tp!.be\in;ith^i;.vety;i.pink'.of;. health and strength to work at that trade lain betjter to-day than I have been at any timo'dnring the past five years.

On the mantelpiece there is a box of opium and morphia pills wnich the dootorgave me to deaden. the excrutiating pain. But they can stay whore they are, for I no longer need them. Eveivbody who knows, me has been amazed at the change in me. They can hardly believe their ey«s. My being about again has caused quite a sonsation out here.' Suoh is the remarkable history, and confirms what is said in all the chief newspapers of this country of tho as tonishing cures wroupht by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.
