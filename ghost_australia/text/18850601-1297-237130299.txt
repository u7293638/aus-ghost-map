"MAN IN SEARCH OF HIS SOUL-" The lecture delivered by Mr.Gerald Massey in West's Academy last night waa entitled, 11 Man in search of hia soul- for fifty thousand years, and how he found it," There was, as usnal, a large attendance, and the leotnre waa listened to tbionchout with marked attention, notwithstand- ing its great length, Said Mr Massey : The one effectual wsy of exploding the pretensions of false beliefs and destroying tbe superstitions thai prey upon and paralyse the human mind is' by ex plaining them from the root. To learn what they once meant in their primitive phase, and trace their developments according to the" law ot evolution, is to know what they do not and car not mean for us to-day. It is by this method alone we can tear away the mtsk of mystery, and have done for ever with alt the, devious devilries of its double- focednessj so that we may look fatly and aqunrely into tha face of Nature for ourselves, wbetuer in tbe past, present or fnture. But we cannot get to the root of mys tery without entering into the myst«rias, the sub ject-matter of which may seem vary remote from na now because ot its nearness to primitive Nature. Mystery has been called the mother of abomina tions, but the abominations tbemaslves are the dogmas and doctrines that have been falsely grounded on the ancient mysteries which hare been misinterpreted and perverted from tha purpose originally intended. Mr Mersey then proceeded to explain that from the earliest times of which any trace can be found there were evidences of a belief in another life, bnt the idsa was of "reproduction" for another life. The dead, some fifty thousand years ago, were buried with this ides, Be traced the burial custom and other rltei aud practices of different countries right back to thii central idea, How, thru, did primitive or archsio man attain that certainty of foothold in the dark void implied by the burial enstoms and the typology of the tomb, which certainly was felt by many of the pic-hietoric races, including the blaok man and the red man, who ia no doubt living on in bis happy hunting grounds ; whereas so many ot our own raoe aid still trying mentally to take that step in the dirk, and stumble because they osn fina no foothold, It is not to be answered by supposing there was a primeval revelation made to primitive man, which showed him once for all that he waa an immortal being. It had taken him (Mr Matsey) twelve rears of ceaseless research to learn how lowly and limited, but how natural, was tbe revelation made to primitive man, We have to grope on hands and knees to read it, When we have ransacked the myths of the world and the;legenda of its chief rsces, wa etn find no such thing anywhere as a beginning with abstract conceptions, But there is abeolnte proof everywhere that man founded at first upon his observation of objective phenomena. Whilst the modem man appears to have teen losing hie soul, or never to have found that he had one, the ancient Egyptians, the BrUonr, f 1 and others reckon thav h.d«r-ea and one. sonl as permanent entity "Wae a sum total of the seven, Mr Idsieey traced the evolution of thought on the snbject among various peoples, from ages back, this portion of his lecture being curiously Interest ing, He then proceeded to the conclusion, as follows The pre-Christian religion founded ou a know ledge ot nature and veritable facts, tbe data being actual and tbe method very simply scientific, The Christian theology was based on ignorant belief which swallowed in faith all that was impos sible in foot end unverified in phenomena, In like manner the primitive mode of constituting a soul that can live on of itself, which was continued by tbe Egyptians as a mode of le- conBtructing the deceased, has been farther continued in a more subtilised and abstract phase of Ksoteric Buddhism, which takes man to pieces in the cext life according to the primitive prin ciples upon which he was first put together in tho way that I hive previously described. In por traying their Ka image of the eecond and spiritual Ego ns a type of the eternal, tbe Egyptians repre sented that which tbetr seers saw, and you may trust tbem for the truth in this as in everything else. Nothing is commoner among the|primitlve races than for the seers to claim that they saw the shadow image of the dead, ) be question was put by a friend of mine in London to the African chief, Cetcbewayo, in re gard to spiritB. "Wo believe in spirits because we see them." Bat when asked if he believed in God, he shrugged his shoulders. God did not de monstrate His existence as the ghosts did. Many primitive races are without God, but none are known who are without their ghosts. In compari son to those who know because they see that there ;b a continuity of existence btyoad tho ctan<o called deatb, because they csd perceive the de-d «s living entities embodied in s rater form,— we are all of us on the blind side of things. They know bs- cause tbey see, and we deny because we du not know. With the savage are the civilised ; seeing makes all the difference, and cuts short all questions of tbe possibility of seeing, I am not an abnormal seer myself, bot have had many years' experience with one who was, nnd received ample demonitra- ticn to other senses (if not to eight) that tho Ka is an acting reality; that Nature includes another life which is as veritable as this, aud is in truth one with it, however otecure the action or intan gible the ordinary manifestation may be. For us who ere familiar with the abnormal human conditions 'these facts are established; they no louger seek for noceptance or recognition. - What tbey now demand is a true interpretation, and with tbe trnth of their interpretation is bound up the religion ot the foture end the proper un derstanding of the physics and metaphyeics of pre-hlstoiie man. Wo hold that these phenomena, which have no relation to the miracles ot misinterpreted mytho logy, demonstrate tha natural nexuB for the next step upwards in human evolution, Current ortho doxy is baBed upon ideas : on the idea that man fell from paradise ; on tbe idea that tbe world was consequently lost ; on the idea that the world is to be saved, and man restored, by a vicarious atonement; on the idea ot a physical resurrec tion from the dead, And all these ideas are at onco non-spiritual, uniclentifie, and utterly delusive, But thu pheno menal Spiritualist in all ages bas founded bis facts, These facts who common with the pre-historio races, and the phenomena were cultivated more intelligently in the ancient mysteries, It is well known, of course, thtt those who entertain such notioss ns there are but a poor feeble sort of folk, But they claim that their knowledge of facts in the present aB in the part, places them at least on a footing of equality with tbo dog, who, with his future piece ot bread resting on his nose is told to " trust " in order that ho may obtain, The known fact iB the phenomenalist's bit of bread- net tbe word "trust"— and it is in evidence for him to day, as it was for the men of tbe paleolithic age, and for tbe adepts in all tbe mysteries ; and he feels that on this ground of fact he is near enough to realisation to " trust " that he, too, may at last attain.
