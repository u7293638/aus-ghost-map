'I am here by your father's desire," said Donal " As a spy," insisted Tongue "Not to my knowledge," returned Donal " He sent me to look for some papers " You he said Tongue, "I see it in your face " "So long as I speak the truth," said Donal, " it matters little to me that you should think me a liar But, my lord, I request that you will give Eppio up to me, that I may take her home to her people " "A likely thing' said Foiguc, straining Eppio to him, and looking with contempt at Donal "Then I will tell you on the word of a man whom neither you nor the world shall find a liar that I will house the a own, and have a crowd about the house in five minutes." ' You are the devil I do believe, come from hell for my turn!" cried Torgue "There, take her Only mind it is you and not I to blame that I do not many her ! I would have done my part Leave us alone and in many her take her from mc in this sneaking fashion, and I make no promises ! ' " Oh but you will, dearest," said Eppio, in a beseeching, frightened, tone Forgue pushed her from him She burst into tears He took her in his arms and began soothing her like a child, assuring her he meant nothing by what he had said You are my own little wife," he went on, "you know you are whatever your enemies may dm 0 us to Nothing can part us now Go with him for the present. The time will come when the truth shall be know n, and we shall laugh at them all If it were not for your sake, and the scandal of the thing, I should send the villain to the bottom of the star 111 double quick time But it is better to be patient " Sobbing bitterly, Eppie went with Donal down the stair, leaving Tongue shaking with impotent rage behind him When they got into the sheet Donal turned to lock the door Eppie seized the opportunity, claimed from him, and ran down the close to the side door But it was locked, and she could not get in Then came a sudden thought to Donal He was with her in a moment ' You go home alone, Eppie," he said, " it will be just as well you should not go in with me I am going to see Lord Fergus out of this Eh, jew inna hurt him '" pleaded Eppie "I will not if I can help it, but he may put it out of my power to spare him I don't want to hurt him there is no revenge in mc You go home It will be better for him as well as for you " she went slowly away weeping, but trying to keep what appearance of calm she might As soon as she was found the corner, Donal hurried back to the front door, and, hastening to the side door, took the key from the lock Then, returning to the hill, he summoned Forget Me lord," lit said, at the bottom of the star, loud enough to be heard through the empty house, ' I have got both the keys the side door is locked and I am about to lock the front door I do not w ant to shut you in Vial come down before I go ' league came leaping down the stain, and threw himself upon Dr mil A fierce struggle for the possession of the key which Donal held in his hand commented The sudden assault at ig ci(d D wall, and he fell on the look with For give above him who immediately laid hold of the Rev. and tried to wrest it from him.
