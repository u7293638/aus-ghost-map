The Bandy, whose figure W88 remarkably symmetrical—being already afraid of losing his waist—Miss Draper, as she would hare expressed herself, "took more than one good' look at him before she played her first card for the hawk, though un hooded, so to-spesk, and flung aloft, bad not yet made quite sure of her quarry, and except as a question of wholeeome practice, it would be a pity to waste much blandishment upon the wrong young gentleman. So she scanned him carefully before she pounoed, approving much of what she saw. Dandy Burton was tall, well-made, and undoubtedly good-looking, with an air, ex tremely becoming when people are not yet twenty, of being over bis real age. His face was very neatly handsome, but there was some thing wanting in its expression, and a woman's eye would have preferred many a plainer countenance which carried a more marked impress of the man within. Even Fanny was conscious of this defect at a seocnd glance. It made her part, she re flected, all the easier to play. Bo gathering some violets from the hedge-side, she tied them coquettishly into a. posy, and then, dropping a curtsey, shot a killing glance atthe Dandy, while she observed, demurely enough— " One of Mr: Archer's young gentlemen, I believe P Dm sure I ask your pardon, sir, if you're not" Dandy Burton, thus challenged, ranged up alongside. " I am staying with Mr. Archer at present," said he, removing the cigar from his mouth and a faint snatch at his round shoot ing hat " Did you want to speak to any of us ? I beg your pardon, I mean, can I be of any service to you before Mr. Archer goes out P" With all the tatoir-vivre he used to boast of in the pupil-room, Mr. Burton was a little puzzled. She was good-looking, die was well got-up, yet something in his instincts told him she was not quite a lady after alt " It's not Mr. Archer," she answered, with a becoming little blush and a laqgb; " it's the young gentleman as father bade me leave a message for—father, down at Bipley Mill, you know, sir." " Bad English. Talks of ' father' and calls me ' sir,'" thought the Dandy, his confidence returning at once. ' All right, my dear," he answered, replacing the cigar in his mouth, and crossing the road, to her ode; "I know Bipley Mill well enough, and I know* father,' as you call him, mean ing, I suppose, my friend Mr. Draper; but I did not know he'd got such a little duck of a daughter. I wish I'd found it out, though, six months ago—I do upon my honour!"" . ' Well, Fm sate!" replied Miss Fumy, in no way takra aback by-the familiar tone pf admiration, to which she was well-accustomed. " You gentlemen are so given to oompliwints, there's no believing ajrord you say. 1 should like to hear, nowj what good it would have done yog if you bad Jmown as I was down ah the Mill six months ago." ... "I should hare walked ore* there every day, on the chance of seeing ypur pretty face!" answered the Dandy, rising, as. he flattered, himself, to the occasion. 'You wouldn't have found me," she laughed; "I've been In London since then. I only came home for good yesterday , evening." r "Then I shall spend all my spare tupeatT, ■ tire Mill now, tilll go away," retorted Burton, rolling the wet end of hia agar with his bestair.

"Because they told me as Mr. Ainslie was the only grown-up gentleman "here," ahe answered, hazarding a supposition that oould not fail to be favourably reoeived, and flatter ing herself she was going on swimmingly. The Bandy, however, did not see the ad-, vantage of being taken for his friend, and thought it right to undeoeive his new flame without delay, " My name's Button," he said, rather eon* ceitedly. "Ainslie's a shorter chap, with darker hair end eyes—altogether, not quite so. —not quite so " he hesitated,'for, though Tain, he was not the least a fool. "Not quite.ao much of a ladies' man, I dare say 1" She finished his sentence for him with a laugh, to cover her own vexation, for ehe felt she had been wasting time sadly. "I don't think you're one as is ever likely to be mis* took for somebody else. I must wish yon good day now, sir. It's more than time I was back. I couldn't stay another minute if it was ever so." She was a little disappointed at his ready acquiescence. " And your message ?"' 'he asked, lighting a fresh cigar. " It wbb only father's duty," ehe answered. ! " I woe to tell the young gentlemen they're welcome to a day's fishing above Bipley Lock to-morrow, if ethey like to come, and there ought to be some sport for 'em, says father, if the. wind keeps southerly." "We'll be there!" answered the Dandy, joyfully. "And I say, how aboutluncheonP You'll bring it us, won't you, from the Mill ?" "For how many?" asked Miss Faaqy; thinking, perhaps, it might not be a bad plan. ' Well, there's three of tu/" answered the Dandy. " Dolly, and Ainslie, and me. Better bring enougfajbr Jour, Miss Draper. It's not every day in the week I do such things. Be sides, you'll sit down with us, you know, or we shan't be able to eat a morsel." She tossed her head. "Indeed, you're very kind," she said. " Well, if you're ell erasing, I'll attend to it, and perhaps bring it yon my self. Xo, air! not a step further. I couldn't think of walking through the village with yon. What would Mr. Archer aay ? Thank you i I can take very good care of myself!" Thus parrying the Dandy's importunities, who, having nothing better to proposed a lounge down to the Mill In her eompany, Miss Draper proceeded on her homeward journey, only turning round when ahe had gone a few steps to comply with his entreaties that ahe would give him her lately-gathered poay.
