BEAOHPOBT. (from our own Correspondent,) . * . September 2?, un Monday evening the ±iev. R. Crainp, of Millicent, delivered a lecture in the Institute Hall on "The life of President Garfield." The attendance was hardly so numerous as might have been wished, and I fear that the Wes leyan Home Mission Fund, in aid of whioh the lecture was given, would not benefit to any great extent. This, of course, was no fault of the lecturer, who dealt with his subject in a very vigorous manner, eliciting frequent bursts of applause from his audience. The lecture was interspersed with vocal and instrumental pieces from several of our local amateurs. I am glad to hear that the exhibition (on be half of Beach port Institute) of dissolving views, given at Kendeisham on Friday last, was verv successful, the room being packed full, A similar entertainment is to be given at Tan tunoula, and I hope it will be as great a success! as the one at Rendelsham. I am sure that the best thanks of the Institute are due to Messrs. ISeale and Attiwill, who have so ungrudgingly given their time and trouble in exhibiting the views. The weather for the last few days has been very fine, and the gardens show plainly the effect of a few days warm sunshine after so much cold and rain. The local fishermen have been rather lucky lately, several good hauls of "euook" (great Cffisar's ghost! what a name) and other iish having been taken. Insist upon having Wou'E's SCHKAPPS.
