TRB -^LL ENGLAND ELEVEN CRICKET MATCH. iT t? ™tck between the B.TT.O.O. eighteen and All England Eleven was concluded yesterday, the Englishmen making 576 runs for the loss of six. wickets. No previous English or Australian Eleven ever made such a large score on the Back Creek ground, and the result o£ tlus play points to one of two conclusions, either that the play of the Englishmen has improved, or there has been a sad falling off in that of the local men. It is to be feared that the latter is the correct one. The young players of the present day as a rule uo not evince the same determination to succeed as did the older cricketers they are supplanting. There is not the same regularity of practice and patient attention to master the iirst principles of the Rami!. It was only by hard woik the old players of Bendigo acquired their skill. The modern aspirant for cricketing fame is in a hurry to jump into the front rank, and feels slighted if matured judgment endeavors to check his haste, and lead him into the royal road. In all points of the game there has been a backward tendency. | Take the fielding, in which the local men on the present occasion showed a lamentable deficiency. In what is called practice, one never sees a young player field with all his might, in fact he is in different as to whether he stops a ball or not, and he appears to feel that it is of very little conse quenco if he misses a catch. All the time he forgets that he will most assuredly carry the same faultiness into hi= play in a match. Half an hour's longstopping to a couple of bowlers will teach a player more field ing than he will acquire in a week according to the system of the present day. Then as to learning to catch; the good old way was to throw the ball from one player to another during some portion of the practice, or to send the ball round the field dur ing the going out and coming in of batsmen. Lying on the grass or getting hold of a bat to have a hit is the style that now obtains. With regard to batting it is an accepted axiom that good _ bowling makes good batting, but what is the existing prac tice. Why that batsmen are content to bat to any kind of bowling, however inferior. They don't show the slightest anxiety to get the best bowlers to bowl at them. The natural result follows, hold ing the rubbishing bowling in contcropt, they hit at it any way and get into a loose style of batting that effectually cripples them when they have to face the real thing. Looking fairly at all these matters it is little wonder the Bendigo men made such a small score and missed so many easy catches, which had they taken, would in all probability have prevented the Englishmen getting half the runs they got. For instance Ulyctt, Barnes, and Bates ought to have been caught beforo they scored, but being missed they made 201 runs between them afterwards. It is to be hoped that the. Won til bo learned from this English match ivill be taken to heart by the rising cricketers, and that in the future they will endeavor to acquit themselves like the men of old, and _ sustain worthily the reputation which Bendigo has gained of being a centre of sterlintr cricket. At noon the Bendigo team took the field, and Ulyett, 44 not out, and Barnes, 20 not out, their places at the wickets. A. .T. Pearce and Osborne took up the trundling. Ulyett began at once to open his shoulders, netting two fours off the first over, a cut and a leg hit. He continued the same vigorous play of the previous day, and notwith standing changes of bowling brought up his score to 75, the live being a line drive over the chains on the on field. The next ball, a nice break back from 'Win. Harry, who was bowling very well, was played on to the wicket, and the great batsman returned to the pavilion amidst great applause. 3—75—155. Bates next ap peared on the scene, and soon gave the field a taste of his quality. Such a grand display of hard hitting and careful play has seldom been seen on the ground. To all kinds of bowling, fast, medium, and alow, he was perfectly at home, and treated them all alike, sending the ball to all parts of the field, or out of the field, with clean ness of hitting and security of play that gave little hope to the bowler or fielder. The first ball he received he gave a chance to tha wicket keeper, and when he had scored 20 he gave a pos sible chance to field on, and again, when about SO, an easy chance was given to Sarvaas at mid on. His career was at last cut short by Pearce catching hiin at the chains at long- field on, over the bowler—the only catch taken during the day. So rapid was his scoring that he soon passed his companion, Barnes, in the race for runs, and at his exit the score stood 4—107—316. The two batsmen had thus put together 1G1 runs. Flowers tilled the vacancy, and though a trifle puzzled at first with J. Harry's bowling soon got to work aud proved himself a batsman worthy to stand alongside those who had gone before him. The end of Barnes wa3 now approaching. He had been playing a splendid innings cllieily charac terised by patieut defence, but towards the end by vigorous batting, especially cutting well. He had been at the wickets for three hours and played beautifully all round. Just before Bates'fall he gave a hard catch to Youlden at mid-on, and just before he was bowled he was missed by R. Bruce off Clark at deep leg. Clark, who had been put on as a change, bowled him clean the third ball, and he retired with the highest score to his credit, 109. 5—109—3SS. Briggs succeeded and lost no time in letting everybody know that though a small v/ell-buiit man he was a big hitter and as hard a smiter with the bat as anyono in the team;fours and fives were the order of the day, Ilia score including four fives and eleven fours. The bowling was changed frequently, but all the pith had been taken out of it, aud drives, cuts and leg hits to the chains bv both batsmen grew monotonous, while the field became despondent, as not a ghost of a chance was given. Flowers at last was tempted out of his ground by a ball from J. Harry, aud Youlden smartly stumped him when he had made 02. G—92—584. Attewell came next, and played a merry game with the bowling until he totted up in no time 37 runs, in which there were seven fours. Time was then called, and he and Briggs, who had scored 98, carried out their bats. The batting of the Englishmen completely overpowered <-he bowling. W. Harry, J. Harry, W. Bruce and Osborno when put on, generally stopped rapid scoring, but the other bowlers were treated unmercifully. In fielding, the Bcndigo men were chiefly deficient in catching; their throwing in was not so bad, but in stopping and picking up the ball they wore generally loose. There were, of courso, several exceptions, J. Harry while wicket-kseping per formed fairly, and fielded well on the out-field. Youlden, who relieved Harry at the wickets, also discharged his duties creditably. A. Mackav, at point, is certainly deserving of honor able mention, and he was frequently applauded for the admirable and cool way he stopped with one hand only, either right or left, many hard hits. In the out field and at longstop G. Mackay fielded brilliantly, doing the work of two men in covering ground, and picking up and returning the ball with the greatest precision. Findley too in the long-field distinguished himself on very rough ground. Pearce also did good service in this department. The umpires, Mr. Lillywhite for the Englishmen, and Mr. Devine for the Bendi gonians, performed their duties satisfactorily, and so did Mr. Southby, the scorer. Mr. Milburn, the caterer, again supplied an excellent luncheon. Annexed is the score :— B.U.C.C.—First Innings S2 All-England Eleven. First innings. Scotton, 11141111111111, c A. Mackay, b B.
