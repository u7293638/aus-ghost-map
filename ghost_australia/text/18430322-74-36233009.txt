My gratitude, geiy tlemen, is like that spacious room--my eloquence, that fiiitlhing raishlight. Bread and cheese, gentliemen, is Isuiumble fam'e; but when .it is gienwith a'hearty welcome, it is better than venison and claret from:the table of a lproud man ; and, the guest will rather receive it itn the spirits it is given,, than for is 'real orth..

Ghosts.-" Ghosts be hanged! No such things in nature; all laid long ago before the wood pavement. What should they come for?l The colliers may rise for hi?dher wages, and the chartists may rise for reform, and Joseph Sturge may rise for his m health, and bread may rise, and the rising ge neration may rise; but that the dead should rise only to make one's hair rise, is more m than I can credit. Suppose yourself a ghost. a Well, if you come out of your grave to serve t a friend, how are you to help him?

Every principal thoroughfare willsoon be overspread with timber; Scotch granite has given way to the produce of the Baltic, and Irish paviors are altogether at a discount. Of all dandies the most disgusting is an ugly one. Puppyism to be endurable, re quires at least good looks; although it must be remarked, that the generality of the breed are remarkable for the contrary. Railway Communication with Scotland.

" Where," exclaimed Sheridan, in continua tion, and with great emphasis-"where shall we find a more foolish knave or a more knavish fool than this ?"
