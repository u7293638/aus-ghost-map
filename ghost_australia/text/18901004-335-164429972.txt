PRETTY ANNIE. This befell in the old days, and, as my friend Private MuU-aney was specially careful to make dear, ths Unregenerate. There had been a royal dog fight in the -nullah at the back of the rifle butts between Xdaroyd's Jock and Ortheris's Blue Rot — both mongrel Rarnpur hounds, chiefly ribs and teeth. It lasted for twenty happy, howling minutes. and then Blue liot collapsed ana Ortheris paid Learoyd three rupees, and we were all very thirst?. A dog fignt is a most heating entertainment, quite apart from the shouting, because Rampuxs fight over a couple of acres of ground, later, when the soonc fof I belt badges clinkin^&gauftt; 'the necks beer bottles had died away,* conversation drifted fram dog to man fights x-f alllancU. Humans resemble red de^xiLsoiQe re^»eota.v Any tape of fighting seems to wake up a sort of imp in their breasts, and they bell one to the other, exactly like challenging buds. This is notice* Able even in men who consider themselves superior to privates of the line : it shows the refining influence of civilisation and the march of progress. Tale provoked tale, and each -tale more beer. \- Even dreamy Learovd'sW^beganto brighten, and he unburdened himself of a Ion? history in -which a trip to Malimm Cove, a girl at Pately Brigg, a g&uger;, himself and a pair of clogs were mixed iu drawling tangle. 4i An' so Xn coot's yead oppen from t' chin t* tflir. an' he was abed for t* matter o* a month,' concluded Learoyd pensively. .Mulvauer came out of a reverie-^-he *fcas ly ing; down— and flourished his heels'In .the air. -i You're a man, IrfHflBjd.v^aid he critically, ' but yon' Ye only f||f^t'jral mesi§ w&ihat;'a an ivry-dcy expayn^&ce; ; 'but I've stud up to a ghost, an' that was not iviy-day expayrience.' ' No/' said Ortheris, throwing a cork at fctm. «« You git np an * address the 'ouse — you «n*yer expayrience.' Zs it a bigger one nor v' I iver lovpd. yov acnm the nullafii if that pbipe*bruk — Ah!

JtoA' it;-reYeremly, but I was fins, r ^3fl' 1 'Will you tell us about the ghost light if I ?do ?' I said. 'Is ut the shtorv that's troublin* you? Av coorse I wilL I mint to all along. I was only gittin* ut my own wav, as Popp Boggle said whin they found him thryin' to ram a cartridge down the muzzle. Orth'ris, fall away !' He released the little i/oudoner, took his pipe, filled it, and his eyes twinkled. He has the most eloquent eyes of any one that I know. ' Did 1 iver tell you,' he began. ** that I was . wanst the devil av a man?' 'You did.' said Learoyd. with a childish gravity that made Ortheris yell with laughter, for Mulvaney was;always impressing upon us his merits in'the old days. 'Did I iver tell you/* Muhaney continued calmly, 'that I was wanst more av a divil than I am now;'* 'Mer-ria! You don't mean it?** said Or theris. 'Whin I was Corp'ril I was rejuced after wards. but. :-s I say, whin I was Corp'ril,! was a devil of a man,' He was silent for nearly a minute. 'Eyah ! They was great times. I'm ould cow; my hides wore off in patches; sinthry-go has discon ceiled me, and Fin a married man to L ? But I've had my day, I've had my day, and nothin* can take away the taste av that !
