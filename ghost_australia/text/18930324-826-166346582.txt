LAST WORDS OF GREAT MEM. To my mind there is something intrinsi cally beautiful in dwelling at times upon the last words uttered by great men prior to their entry into the mystic regions of the great unknown, of which the poet says— ' 0 death, O beyond, Thou art sweet, thou art strange. The last words of Mahomet, the great prophet of Islam were—" 0 God, pardon my sinB. Yes, I come among my fellow citizens on high." He then peacefully ex pired upon a carpet spread upon the floor. " Pray for ine, my son," were the last words to' the faithful Cardinal of Pavia who watched him dying, of Pope Pius II. The last words of Michael Angelo were —" In your passage through this life, re member the sufferings of Jesus Christ." The Earl of Boscommon died repeating " My God, my Father, and my friends, do not forsake me in the end." Judge Tenterden's last words were— " Gentlemen of the jury, you will consider your verdict." Showing us how in some cases the characteristics of life will mani fest themselves at the hour of death. Lord brighten our declining day That it may nlever'wane, Till death whenallthings round decay, Brings back the morn again.
