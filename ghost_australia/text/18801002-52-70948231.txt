TARALGA. September 27. Trra MOUNT Wintoxo Dianiirc!3.-As tho Mount Werong goldfields are tho tulle ol' the dny, I cannot «co wlij' I should not have un opinion. I arrived from tho so-called diggings on thc "nth, after vol hing threo weeks, some days in granite rock, oilier days in black mud, and all I could soo-if yon like you may terra it-tho ghost of gold, us the substance V.MS nowhere to bo found. Tho average depth of thc pinking is from lift to 13ft, whon you bottom on granite. You cannot call it rock, for in most casoa yon can sink 3/>ft or 20ft in thc so-called granite with but little trouble. Tho opinions of old miners differ very much ?whether tho rock bo granito or not. My opinion is that tho BO- called granite) is only a trap-rock, aa tho lowor foundation of tho mountain is slate, which you can seo projecting out in tho gullies, mixed with a conclomeratod rock. I boliero the Government geologist has gone out, and np doubt ho will bo able to decido if tho granite is bottom. .Should it provo to ba tho bottom, thoro is not tho loast doubt but tho field will prove a duffer. Should thore bo w.ashdirt between thc granito and tho slate, then wo can expect gold. It'H not advisabio for any -gold-seeker to tako notice of any correspondent writing, unless tho said reporter was on tho ground. I havo noticed report» in country pnpers that I must say cannot bo relied on, for no such gold as roported ovor was found on tho rush up to tho present timo. It into bo hoped that the now ohmas that %vorkod so hard will bo rewarded, since the old miners havo left for richer fields. A slight f«ll of snow on tho 25th, with plenty of rain. Crcps and gra^s look well.
