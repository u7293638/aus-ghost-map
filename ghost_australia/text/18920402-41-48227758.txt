PROFITLESS. TO THE EDITOR. Sirâ€” Capital is an aggregate of values. Value is but a mental appreciation ; in fact a ghost. Values may be destroyed by argument, or even a tendency in argument. To fiirhti capital is as unprofitable to labour as fighting ghosts. Labour by increasing confidence will benefit by increasing capital, the mother of wages. Capital is frequently dissipated. The MacDonnell Ranges prospectors would per haps hardly be content with ' the whole pro duce of their labour.' Speculators who paid their wages have lost capital. I am, Sir, &c;, J. B. SHERIDAN.
