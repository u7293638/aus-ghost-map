1 CITY- LIFE IN CORINTH: I The Bishop of Melbourno continued his lecture on " The Gospel and City Lifo of Corinth," in St Paul s Pro cathedral yester day afternoon. The building was crowded, and a large number of people wero unable to gain admission Bishop MOORHOUSE Said -I shall cndea vour to-day to exhibit to you the churchs conflict at Corinth with immorality, and next Wednesday, when I shall deliver the last of tina series of lectures, I shall speak to you of the church's conflict with false liberty V o learn from the nth chapter of the first Epistle of Corinthians, that while the members of the church were boasting and swelling about their wisdom, their spiritual gifts, and their leaders, they were suffering a form of immorality to lift up its head amongst them unrebuked which would have been counted infamous even amongst the heathens This was a flagrant stain upon their purity, a poisonous contagion which threatened their very life Gathering up. therefore, as it were, all the spiritual forces of the church, his own apos tolic authority, the suffrage of the as sembly, and the power of trie Lord Jesus, which dwelt in both, St Paul smites the offender with the rod of excommunication Tho terms in which he delivers his sentence are peculiar, ond reveal to us in a very strik mg way the apostle's view of the relation of the church to paganism He solemnly de- livers tho offender to Satan The figure here would seem to be suggested by the ancient theocracy The church was the holy city, surrounded everywhere by an outlying pagan ism Of the city of God Christ was the lord and king Of the dark domain of heathenism the ruler was Satan To deliver a man, then.to Satan, was to cast htm forth into the outer dark ness, whero Satan ruled Carry him forth, the apostle seems to say, to the confines of the camp of God, and stamping on his brow the brand of excommunication, drive him out into the waste wilderness of paganism, whero bis master will be, not Christ, but Satan tho lord of that lost land This form of speech presents to us moat vividly tho owfnl ness in the apostle a eyes of the sentence he una pronouncing, and at the same time the moral austerity which puts holiness before everything We must not forget to notice however, first, the occasion of this stern disci- pline It is not provoked by any examination of the state of the mind or feelings of the offender, but by open and notorious trans gression, transgression so flagrant and visible that, unless the church cast it out, she must appear to all men to condone and snare it Wo notice in the second place the pur pose of tbo discipline It is intended, through present suffering, to reclaim the offender, ' that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus ' Christianity never punishes merely to make an example of a man, it never sacrifices the individual to the society without thought of the individual's weal It makes much of the single soul, recognising its lofty nature, its wondrous destiny, its place in the heart and work of the Divine Saviour This is the very note indeed of tho evan gelical spirit At the same time, of course, it cannot neglect the contagious character at evil Such an one as this incestuous offender, if he were suffered to flaunt his infamous sin in men's eyes unrebuked, would infect and deteriorate the whole body This conse quence would follow in any age, and how much more then in that, when the church was scarcely extricated from the cleaving taint of pagan immorality, when, a small and feeble band, it was threatened on every side by the almost unbroken power of a vast and shameless heathenism Do you not know, cries the apostle, how small a portion of leaven suffices to change the whole nature of the dough, and is not the lump here at Corinth all too apt to respond to the evil influence? Do you not see that the little island of purity recently arisen from the formless abyss is beaten and assailed on every side by the billows of an overflowing licentiousness? Do you not see that the dykes of Christian law and discipline hardly keep out tho furious flood, and that if you suffer any, even tho smallest, breach in them to go unrepaired, the raging sea of wickedness will too surely re claim its own? The world of St Paul's days was like that wild and lawless land, outside the pale of Arthur's Christendom, of which the laureate sings m his Idylls of the King In the midst of this chaos of lust and cruelty there rises the fortress of tho Christian Church, to find sanctuary in which the hunted soul of man is seen flying in the night, with all the legions of evil in full chase What kind of refuge were it if the evil found place within -if tho soul escaped only from death into a dungeon? Discipline, and eveu the sternest discipline, was necessary in days like those, not only for the church s sake, but also for the world s It is a branch of the same subject which tho apostle takes up in the 7th chapter of this epistle The Corinthians had asked him three important questions on the subject of marriageâ€”Were married Christians to live together, or might they separate ? What should be done when a Christian con vert was married to a heathen? And, lastly. What should parents and guardians do-should they give their virgins in mar nage' To the first question the apostles reply is prompt and clear-between Christians marriage is indissoluble ' Let not the wife depart from her husband This answer was dictated by the loftiness of the Christian ideal of marriage It was a union not between two bodies merely, but between two spirits each supplying to the other something that it lacked, the man giving to the woman strength of character and firmness of will, and re ceiving for his own solace and elevation, grace, sympathy, tenderness This union, sO deep and dear requiring nothing less than a lifetime for the development of all its wealth of mutual improvement was further hallowed and glorified m the Christian church by its representative character It was taken as an image of the love between Christ and His church , and those who entered into it were bidden to aim at nothing less than the tenderness and purity of that divine and eternal relation To establish such a relation . in the world was to lift humanity to a higher phase of moral existence From the doors of snch n home there went forth influences which gave a new purpose and fashion to every relation, whether social or political, of human life It elevated woman to an abso lute equality with man It made slavery impossible, for slavery cannot co exist with Christian marriage, aud how could you part those who wero one m Christ, one for eternity? As Baur has pointed out, " It waa Christianity which, by the quiet power of ita family and wedded life, broke down the aristocratic and despotic spirit of tho ancient world, ' making the state less, and the individual more, and setting the crown of existence not on those qualities and relations which were political, but which were spiritual and human What a gracious ten dernes is there in Tertullian'a description of the union of two believers "of one hope and one conversation ' " Both are brethren, both are fellow servants, there is no difference of spirit or of body , they are truly two in one flesh Where there is one flesh there is also one spirit, they pray together, fast together, lead and admonish one another They are together in the church of God in sorrow or m joy, neither conceals anything from the other, neither is troublesome to the other Christ rejoicea when ho sees and hears such things, to such He sends His own peace ' Perhaps this description may owe something to the fervid writer's African imagination, but the ideal is there, and before the Gospel suggested it such an ideal could have presented itself to no man's mind In ita very statement wo feel the breathing of that pure and tender feeling which brooded like a heavenly dove above the Christian home From the stand point of such an ideal what answer could the apostle give to the first question but that Christian marriage was indissoluble' Per haps, also, the recognition of his Christian standpoint may help us to understand his probably unexpected decision of the second question It was very natural for a convert man or woman, who had a heathen pirtner to feel doubts about the validity of the morringo union T.Iie more clearly the con vert realised Ins union with Christ all the moro vi as lie likely to feel the aireas of the difficulty Ile waa drawn into union with Christ How, then could ho continue in union with one who was out of Christ' A daily diversity of tastes dispositions and habits would obtrude the reality of some thing lil e a spiritual separation Was not then, the marriage ipso facto dissolved ' The apostlo decides that it is not so I hat same new spiritual relation to Christ which created the difficulty had so ennobled and sanctified the married relation that the Christian woman tied to a heathen husband by this sacramental bond of Eden drew her unbelieving husband into the kingdom of god Her tie with Christ could not be broken Neither could her tie to her husband Therefore tho husband must be conceived us drawn if not into the light of the kingdom at least into a kind of theocratic twilight which was better than tho outer darkness or heathenism And for the same reason the children of mixed marriages are to be counted holy, capable througlt. their connexion with their believing mother and through the impression of her spirit of being baptised into the Inuno Name It is im possible to conceive a stronger declaration of the permanence on Christian principles of tho marriage bond All tho more startling, then is it to find the apostle m his answer to the third question of the Corni thians leaning to tho side of celibacy His decisions about virgins is-though he admita the difficulty of the question, and only oro fesses to give hm private judgment on it that it ia better for them if their will be free, not to marry But now it is of tho utmost importance, if wo would understand this de cisiÃ³n, that wa inquire into tho grounds of it Is it based upon the nature of man, and of tho marriage institute, or has it only refer ence to the circumstances of a particular age? If the former, it is equally valid, BO far as it goes, for all time, but if the latter, it will Dilly have application to thoÃ¤o .vilo aro in these contemplated circumstances I can have no doubt that the grounds of the apostle a counsel are of tlio latter kind He Buya that single life he Bupposcs, " is good for the pro sent distress St Paul said that persecution waa imminent, a persecution that would put men in danger of losing property and life, and which might mvolvo them m torture, imprisonment, and every form of suffering And who could fail to see that marriage would multiply the trials of such a time almost indeflinitely ' A man might bear to suffer himself but if he saw his wife subjected to indignity, his children tortured, starved, or imprisoned-would not this be a fearful trial of his faithfulness ' Might not many a mans constancy give way, and at best must not his sufferings be most cruelly aggravated ÃŽ Surely, in the prospect of such a time, it waa better for a man who was master of his own will not to marry or give his daughters in marriage Certainly, however, this is not the only reason given by St Paul He seems to say that marriage will cause a man or woman to care so much to please the partner as to interfere with duty to Christ Now, we know that this is by no means a necessary consequence , but on the contrary, in auoh a marriage aa that described by lertulhan, a man might be sustained in bia self devotion to it by the tenderness and elevation of his wife a character What, then, ta the meaning of this statement of tho apostle? We must remember that it only ex presses the apostles opinion with respect to that time and place And, remembering this, it ia natural to ask whether there were any circumstances in the lifo of Corinth which were likely to call forth such counsel' There certainly were It 13 truo that no Christian father would have thought of giving his daughter to a heathen , but then he must give her to a man who had been a heathen, and who looked upon mar ringe with very much of tho heathen feeling Hie Christian ideal of marriage could not have been realised in a single generation As in the case of all new ethical conceptions, ordinary human bemga could only compre bend and conform to it through a succession of efforts, and throu *h the transmission of moral aptitudes acquired slowly in o, succession of generations Hindoo converts know that they should be truthful, but it requires a succession of generations to work out the old heathen leaven of deceit If, then, among the pagana at Corinth the ideal of marriage was low and impure, we might expect that the shadow of the evil would rest Ã¢t first over the home of the newly converted Christian and that the ideal of marriage was low, almost indeed at its lowest, in tho Corinth of the apostle s days, we have the clearest evidence The Greek wife of those timeÃ¤ was simply a household drudge without edu cation, living, as Plato says a life of seclusion and darkness, rarely seeing her husband, and living mostly in separate apartments in the society of her slaves Marriage was so distasteful to the Greeks that, as among the Romans, it had to be enforced by law Tho morals of tho Greek women were as low as their intelligence, in Sparta especially, where married women lived in such a state of unbridled licentiousness as is hardly credible It speaks for itself that, in the whole course of their history tho Greeks de veloped no noble woman. Antigone is the creation of the imagination of Sophocles, but where are the Miriams, tho Deborahs, the Abigails, of Greece? Horrible as it is to have to say it, where among Greek women there was culture there was brazen immorality Aspasia, the illustrious companion of Pericles, and Theodota, the friend of Socrates were not among the wives, but the HetairÃ¦ of Greek history. Corinth was the metropolis of these Hetaira under Roman rule and besides was the most dissolute city in the world. Remembering these facts, and bearing im mind that ideals are but slowly realised, it is wonderful that even among Christian converts at Corinth marriage was still a relation which encumbered a man with cares which stood in the way of prayer, and waa generally rather a check upon debauchery than what in ideal it was, and um fact it after wards became. It was of this marriage that St Paul spoke, and of it he said that it was less desirable than celibacy. The apostle's advice in short was founded entirely upon the circumatances of his own time , upon the dread of approaching persecution, and upon the imperfect realisation of the Christian ideal of marriage But now, in view of that disastrous history of celibacy which has sought to justify itself by the apostle's teaching. it is most important to point out what was not the ground upon which that teaching was based It was not based upon the view that marriage was in it self less pure or honourable than virginity. Strange to say, this groundâ€”doctrine of a later Christian asceticismâ€”was built upon a philosophy which the church had rejected as heretical. Nothing could be fiercer than Ter tullian's denunciation of gnosticism as a sys tem of doctrine. Nothing can be clearer than his submission to the sentiment which gnosticism created. I have before explained the fundamental position of gnosticism It held tho existence of two independent principles-the one good tho other evil The hood principle it identified with spirit tho evil principle with matter and the finite world Between these principles there was everlasting war. If, therefore, a man would be rid of evil he must free himself, not from wilfulness or selfishnessâ€” the only thing which is really evilâ€”but from matter and tho finite, as though it were only evil to have a body and limitation This strange theosophy can be traced first to the Indian and Egyp tian gymnosophists, and through them to the Buddhists of Hindostan ' ' The identity of this occult element, it has been truly said, "working under so many forms, and during the lapse of so many centuries, and struggling on from east to west like a pestilence, born in the mud of the Ganges and spreading death to the shores of the Atlantic, becomes mam fest when we keep the eye fixed upon certain of its constant characteristics.' In spreading through the world with its high philosophical pretensions and its delusive promise to solve the dread enigma of evil, it had thrown a kind of glamour over the soul of man. Many imbibed from it a contempt of the material and tho bodily who fiercely resisted it as a theory of life. No man, indeed, could think at all in the first four Christian centuries without feeling the spell of its speculative fascination it was to those centuries what German philosophy has been to these. It swayed the feelings and sentiments of its bitterest foes. Baur has shown with great skill how its contempt for the bodily pro duced a twofold effect On the one side, it led some of the gnostic sects to affirm that bodily acts were things indifferent and that a man might preserve his spiritual purity while wallowing in the worst vices On the other hand, it produced a hatred of everything connected with tho body, and ended in the most rigorous asceticism. Its effect on the Christian view of marriage was deep and most disastrous. In their admira tion for gnostic asceticism, men like Ter tullian strove to combine an allowance of marriage as something lawful, but inferior, with a fanatical admiration of celibacy which passed all bounds of reason The error, as was but natural, quickly spread In the works of Basil and Chrysostom the worship of celibacy has passed into an almost unreasoning fanaticism ; and what it is most important to observe, it is based everywhere, though unconsciously to the saintly writersâ€”upon the gnostic view of the fundamental impurity of everything bodily. The church was nursing a viper in her bosom, and when it was warmed, it lifted its horrid head and stung her well nigh to death. The effects of this asceticism were two fold. Through its low heathen view of marriage it drew everything that was best and holiest into tho secluded life of celibacy and those trying to satisfy the heart of man made for sympathy and the pure domestic affections, with solitary visions, it produced at length that pruriency of feeling and falling over into forbidden lusts and prac tices, it is painted in colours so sombre and with an anguish so deep by the wonderful brush of St Chrysostom. Secondly, by im prisoning, one may almost say by entombing, all that was spiritually lovely and influential in the cloister, it left the great mass of humanity with a sense of its own inferiority and a suspicion that even its holiest affec tions were unclean, to sink deeper and deeper into the mire of an unblessed sensuality. In reading over again with reference to this sub ject the picture drawn by Salvian of the moral condition of the church and the world in tho fifth century, when this system was bearing its ripened fruit, I experienced a shock of horror which I should have thought a former acquaintance with it would have made impossible. But who can read, even for the fiftieth time, of a state of Christendom in which ' every Christian assembly had bo come a sink of vices," where "you will barely find one who is not guilty of all tho worst crimes that can stain our humanity ;" where "there is hardly a rich man who is not chargeable with both the sins of murder and adultery, where, in slaughtering and debauching their slaves, they recognise it as a right, not a crime "; where tho awful desolations of the barbarian invasions did but produce blas phemy and worse immorality, if worse could be, where the vices of a degraded and de based Christendom awoke the open scorn and almost incredulous amazement of the pagan conquerers. Who can survey such a picture as this, drawn by a man of the highest cha- racter, writing of what he has seen, and shuddering to tell his tale, without feeling that this horrible gnostic contempt for the body and the sanctities of tho home was an emanation from the pit of darkness itself. Not in vain shall I have drawn this picture, and called attention to this error, if it warn some among us of the danger of tampering with that most sacred of Christian institutions and most lovely of Christian ideals â€”the joining together of two redeemed souls in the bands of Christian marriage. Never does St. Paul hint even at any contempt for the body. The body with him is holy ; it is nothing less than the temple of the Holy Ghost, the germ of a new birth, in which it shall no longer be corrupt and natural, but spiritual and immortal, crowned with the glory of Christ. Resist then, I beseech you, every effort to dim the lustre of this glorious ideal, treat the suggestion of temporary ties, or of easier methods of divorce, as they deserve, and be ever on your guard againat the specious fallacy that celibacy is better than marriage, or that there is anything holier on earth than the Christian home Re member, above all (and I deliver it as a grave and solemn warning to this community) that what some people are seeking to tamper with in the name of bastard socialism, is a precious moral habitude of purity of exceedingly slow growth, hard to form and easy to lose, which once lost, moreover, can only be regained by generations of painful restraint, compelled by social catastrophe You may destroy the oak of a hundred summers in an hour, but it will require a hundred years to replace it.
