A NEGRO DEPUTY. Mr Legitimus, the new Socialist Deputy for Guadeloupe, is a negro. According to tho "Matin" he dresses in the latest fashion, wearing silk hat, patent leather shoes, whito necktie, and irreproachably-cut frock coat. This, it appears, is indispensable for any can- ' didate whose ambition it is to represent tho dusky electors of Guadeloupe. M. Legitiinus's only sartorial peculiarity is the wearing of a volu minous flaring red neckerchief, which does duty as the banner of his political opinion. It is more curious to learn that the French ' ' black man" believes in ghosts, and is, indeed, himself much honoured i n his own country as a 6orcerer. When about to be elected a member of the General Council of Guadeloupe, M. Legi timus performed extraordinary terpsichorean and vocal feats by moonlight in a cemeaery, whereby the Evil One wns vanquished and tho performer's election assured. M. Legitimus owes his election to the school teachers of Guadeloupe, who are rabid Socialists.
