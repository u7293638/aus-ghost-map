THE ENEMIES OF BOOKS. Rome months ago n little pamphlet with this attractive title was published at Lyons. Hut the volume wns worthless, licing ono of those tracts whieh are written merely that the author may see uicnsclf in print. Still, the title, nnd tbe disap pointment caused by the mcagrenees of the essay, liavo induced Mr, llladcs to give Ids experiences of the " KncmLes of ltooks " In a trade journal, while thu writings of M. Rouvcyrc and others hnvo elucidated thu subject. One of tile most deter mined foes of books Is tho bookworn — the insect, not tho student, Mr. Hlndes.wnB nnxlouB to collect n few bookworms to exhibit nt the C'axton Celebra tion ; but he might as well linvo tried to display a few ghosts in a glass case, As in the matter of ghosts, Mr. Hlodcs could find no WllncsA who had actually 6oen a bookworm. Their works are manifest to nil, and the neat round holes they drill from cover to cover of n rolumo nre absolutely Irreparable. Mcntxcllus maintained that lie had beard tho liook- worm carol to Its mntc ; but Meutzclius lias been dead llieso many years, nnd he may liavo been the victim of some hallucination. All apparitions, It Is wn axiom of scienuo, nre hallucinations, anil why not all lxiokworins I Tho hookworm, necotiling to Ment- zclius, carries a grey crest, and when it calls its mate It oinps its wings with a loud rattle. If this bo true, tho term "worm" seems a mis- tiomcr, Tlio way to nnnoy nnd discomfit book worms ts to anoint the woolen covers of old books witli olivo oil tinctured wilii nrwcnlo.
