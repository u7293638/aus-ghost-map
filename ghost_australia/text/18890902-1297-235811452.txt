THE " CALICO JEMMIES." The ghost of the " Calico Jemmies" which the protectionists are continually raising to scare the advocates of freetrade was for over laid at rest by Mr. James Martin, M.P., at the Protee- tant-ball on Saturday night. The protectionists never tire of inveighing against a system which, they, say, enables the " Calico Jemmies," as they politely term the importing class, to reap large profits out of the helpless consumers. " If," say tho escaped VictoruinB, "we only followed the example of the sister colony, nil this would be changed.'' This nrgamont had the bottom knocked out of it on Saturday night. Calico it seemB, pays not a single penny duty in Victoria, and last year tho Victorians imported £1,053,000 worth of it. Then cotton and linen piece goods, habeidashcry and straw hats are also admitted into Victoria duly freo, with the result that the ' Calico Jemmies' of Victoria imported last year no less than £1,732,000 worth. " Why," said Mr. Martin, if wo had protection here on tho Victorian plan the ' Calico Jemmies' would couio up smiling ul; the time ! The fact is," said Mr. Martin, " that many of these catch-words or gags are myths. The protectionists have got hold of them iu souiu way without in the least understanding what they mean." But it was left to Mr. LTaynes, when supporting a vote of thanks to the speakers Messrs. Abigail, Martin and Frank Cotton) to point the moral of tho tale. " The calico that is going to spring up and flourish in this country," said the member for Mudgee, " will ho made of this Cotton, pointing to the apostle of the single tax on the other side of the chair, and the witticism elicited a burst of cheering from hundreds of single tax throats.
