Dr. Bevan, of the Independent Church, Melbourne, who attended as the representative of the council of the Victorian Congregational Union was, on the motion of the Rev James Buchan associated with the assembly during the session The thirtieth annual report of the Congregational Union of New South Wales was then read by the clerical secretary (Rev James Buchan) The report stated that the following churches were without pastors - Homebush, Croydon, Rockdale, Auburn, Granville, Rookwood, AA'illoughby, Leichhardt, Orange, Stanmore, Stockton, and Wallsend A new church had been completed at Eccleston, in the Paterson district, and had been opened free of all debt The Old South Head- road Church had been sold the services having been discontinued there for some time The proceeds had been applied to the reduction of the debt on the church at Watson's Bay in the centre of population, where the Old South Head congregation was now worshipping The Watson's Bay and Druitt Town churches had completed the repayment of their loans, and no new loan had been granted to any church during the rear Loans of £100 and £50 had been made to the publications and home mission accounts respectively A balance of 2159 15s 5d stood to the credit of the building loan fund at the date of closing of the year's accounts The Lay Preachers' Association had been doing a very important work During the year no less than 12 churches and mission stations had been supplied with Gospel services by means of this agency Several of the churches without pastors had, in circumstances of great financial trial, been much helped by the preachers The general com- matter had decided to recommend that the Year Book should be discontinued as an Australian year book, and that in the meantime an annual report for New South Wales alone should be published the expenses in connection with the management of the Independent had been carefully watched during the year, but the difficulty in getting the paper to pay its way had been very great The want of the necessary support had caused the question to be raised as to whether the paper should not be discontinued at the end of this year The financial difficulty for the year centred in the home mission fund. At the commencement of the year one quarter's grants, amounting to £118 lbs, were unpaid and the year had terminated with a debtor balance on this account of £415 16s 8d, being £138 7s 7d less than last year By the promises made at the last union meetings and other sums £20612s had been received and appropriated as shown in the debts liquidation account. On the 20th November, 1891, the indebtedness on the various accounts amounted to £1333 19s 4d At the closing of the books on 9th October, 1895, the entire indebtedness was £939 66 'd 1 its result had been secured, first, by a much more stable and satisfactory income than formerly, and second, by very much greater economy in the working of the office During the year there had been received in connection with the various accounts -Union, £117 17s 7d building loan fund, £161 17s id home missions, 979 9s 5d publica- tions 548 13s 5d and ministers retiring fund, £618 178 oz, or a total of 509 19s 2d as the income for the year of the various accounts administered by the committee Reference was made to the sad deaths through the Redfern railway disaster of Messrs E. L Jones and H Berry, both of whom were members of the Strathfield Congregational Church. Mention was also made of the late Rev G Pratt and 6 G Howden and Mrs Hardie, wife of the Rev C Hardie On the motion of Mr James Brown, seconded by the Rev' E T Dunstan, the report was unanimously adopted Dr Sydney Jones moved, - ' That an honorarium of 500 be granted to the Rev James Buchan for his valuable services as clerical secretary to the union during the past year " He said that he did not wish it to be thought for one moment that the amount was anything like equivalent to the work performed. The Rev Dr Roseby, in seconding the motion, said that the clerical secretary had successfully carried out his duties without injury to his church at Pyrmont The motion was agreed to Mr. J H. Mullens moved,-" That the publication of the Independent be discontinued at the close of the year 1895 " He said that he took this step on the decision of the publications committee The paper was not supported as it should be. There were only 362 subscribers out of the large body of Congress tionahsU in this colony. The editors were unpaid, and the loss on the year, business was estimated at £21. In regard to the Year-book there was a loss of £16, but the work did not seem to be required. The Assembly had, by the adoption of the committee's recommendation, embodied in the annual report, decided that the publication should cease. The Rev George Campbell seconded the motion, and said that unless they could ob- tain 250 additional subscribers it would be a financial impossibility to carry on the journal. He said that there were only 727 subscribers in all the colonies at the beginning of the year, but the number had since been reduced to GSG 'the Rev E T. Dunstan said that one reason of non-success was that the news was a month old. He thought that they should have a weekly journal. The Rev. Dr. Roseby moved as an amendment, " That the Austt (than Independent be for the present continued, and that this assembly pledges itself to secure not less than 200 additional subscribers for next year " The Rev. Dr. Bevan, of Melbourne, who was well received, said that a great opportunity was now offered for the establishment of an excellent denounce national journal for the whole of Australia. He thought that they might be able to start a weekly penny journal (Hear, hear ). If co-operation could not be arranged, both the Victorian and New South Wales journals should be carried on The Melbourne council had had under consideration the question of the establishment of a federal paper The amendment was carried by 46 to 66 votes Mr Harper moved,-" That the committee of the union be directed to appoint a sub-committee with power to consider and deal with the question of re- casting the form of the journal or amalgamation with the Victorian Indiptndenl, and report the result to the next half yearly meeting " The motion was carried The Rev E A J Griffith B A , moved that the word " laymen " in rule 7 of the constitution should be omitted, with a view to the insertion of the words " non-ministerial delegates," so as to make lady delegates eligible for official appointments Discussion ensued, and an amendment was moved having for its object the reference of the question to the committee of the union. The Rev. James Hill, M A., moved the previous question, which upon being put was carried. The assembly rose at 6 10 o'clock, and tea was provided for the ministers and delegates in the deacon's vestry THE EVENING SESSION -THE CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS The evening session was held in the Pitt-street Church at 7 JO p in The service was largely attended, and the Rev W Allen, ex-chairman of the union, conducted the devotional portion of the proceedings the service of praise was led by the choir of the Summer Hill Church, of which the chairman is the minister The Chairman of the union (Rev W J L Close, R A ) then delivered the annual address He said Can I be a consistent Christian and keep myself apart from the great questions of the day which move our social and political life ? can I be true to Christ and the sacred charge he has entrusted me with and not carry my Christianity into the muddy, waters of State legislation and the seething tides of social reform ' Can I obey His mandate to follow him and not make the principles which governed his life the principles of my citizenship in this nation P We are all aware that there are those who would answer these questions by declaring that Christians having been chosen out of what they are pleased to call, the world, with its concomitants of the flesh and the devil, should leave its affairs to those who are left to those who are still its children, who have not learned the love of God or the saving power of Christ, while they themselves live on heights of separate and supposed holiness befitting their peculiar graces and attainments, untouched, untainted, and unoffended by the putrefying sores of national and social life Practice this line of action, and we hand humanity over to those for whom Christ died to re- deem it, and this God-created, Christ redeemed, Holy Ghost infused world ceases to become the foot- stool of God, and becomes the throne of the prince of the powers of darkness Others again would remind us that politics have their place and Christianity has its place, and that in their opinion these should be kept strictly separate They draw a line of demar- cation between what they call secular and religious. in the Church and all that pertains thereto they move and have their being under one set of principle off"- in business and politics and quite another With all on the one side God has directly to do , with all on the other side nothing to do In this latter man is left to his own mental ability, his business acumen, his w worldly common sense So Christianity is divorced from what constitutes the greater part of his life, and in the sphere where Christ's spirit, Christ's guid .wcp,içiiriflt',ii hove-to »o»Lneçd,ei}, tiwt.jjuaonj! Nations to our fellow-men, he is ruled out of court secular and sacred indeed ' What God has joined together let no man put asunder. Now, throughout long centuries of sorrow and distress, labour, and four, trouble and disappointment men have always looked forward for a golden age' Hither and thither in the wilderness barren hopes and fruitless off -Is humanity has wonderous ex- patiating its sins leaving to have faith in Go Deep in their heart there is a reverence and loyalty to the Divine mean that no price bill Hill has over called forth, and though they cannot define how it is so they have a strong faith that He alone can right earth's wrongs, and that in the application of his teachings box the cure for our sorrow s and our sins The) may not, probable a" "ot, believe in the representation of Christ given by our Cluirchosif we may judge by the indifference which they manifest, not to speak of the hostility which that difference occasionally deepens to There is a widespread and I fear a growing bed of that our institutions the not adequately represent the Christ that we have of need to be insane his spirit and carr) Ins teachings into our practicality, that you have narrow ed the scope of his labours and sacrifice to a mechanical getting used) the due punishment of our sins, that we have made him to have to do simply with the other words, while they hold that at least bore an 1 now he has mainly to do with this NN hither such ideas are correct or not it is certain that we must foo i thorn, nntlsoonor or letter answer their impeachment But, though nan) lins, e thus broken with the Churches, there are few indeed who have broken with 61 mt few, indeed but believe His was the right way to go His mind the right man to have, its life the right life to live, His rule the best rule to ha under But I can imagine some one declaring that for 15 centuries Christ and His teachings have had their way Is not this a Christian nation are we not a Christian people ? Yet the old sorrows cease not, the old haunting questions are still unsolved, life's struggle grows more acute, life's pain still more intense Lyon so, but not because Christ has reigned, but be cause He has not resigned Is there any one bold enough to assert that to any very appreciable extent the mind of Christ is expressed in our social and political life Dara wo declare that the unspeakable evils of our social life are the expression of the mind of the sinless That the fierce competition of business, and the thousand meannesses and the tricks of trade are embodiments the will of the author of the golden rule J That the political self-seeking, chicanery, and untrust worthiness are the outcome of the government of God ? Nor does it need a very (loop knowledge to comprehend that our legislation is for the most part passed, not in the interests of man, " the sum and crown of things," but of property Property has ousted the man from his position, and the sceptre of king has been transferred from the hands of his manhood into the hands of M minion Ihofrco trade legislator does not espouse his policy because it represents the mind of God, and because he believes that along to a path lies the moral and spiritual development of the race, but because he believes that by such a policy the greatest financial prosperity can be obtained for him and his and in like manner the protectionist has no idea of mining by his policy at the development of a nobler being, but at the swelling of bank accounts and the increase of material wealth No party gov ornme it which will take into the scope of its MBion and operations the moral and social welfare of the whole is possible Party government must always legis- late for its own, irrespective of the wishes and wills of others who irresponsible monarch is at least supposed to rule in the interest of all but to-day we have no king but the mayors), and we forgot that the rule of the minority may be as great a tyranny as that of Nero or the Czar the principles that fig it for supremacy to-day are the same as those that engaged in conflicts centuries ago the divine right of kings to rule lins simply) transferred its claim to the divine right of property to govern the right of the Pope to assume a dictatorship has become the claim simply of accumulated millions The will of the people has not been incorporated in legislation or even heeded, though loud-voiced profession has again and again been made , but, on the contrary, the people's will has been cheated, obstructed, and defeated almost without exception l, and the so called mandate of the people ignored and set aside until deep in our hearts there is hidden the betrothal our boasted democracy, on which we have plumed ourselves so proud!), is an liter failure-at least, as we have translated standing bulk of its legislating a silly) farce, of woree That legislation that does not express the mind of God as to the ruling of a nation that does not run in harmony with his great law of love and the golden rule, can result EOoncr or 1 water in but one thing, and that is anarchy No Christ has not resigned He has had no chance We have dethroned Hun, and set up in His place our own man devised institutions, our own selfish a m3, our own wills, our own passions, our own carnal ease, comfort, and pleasure and then some who have feebly entertained the idea that we are a C Italian nation have wondered how He could have made such mistakes in governing us Believe me the bulk of our troubles come not from without but from within, and are due to the fact that we have attempted 1 not without success, a discover ance between God and the national life and laws Do not say that Christianity has nothing to do with the things it has every thing to do with them Christ says someone, was no politician IJai) He was, and the Sermon on the Mount is the political Magna Charta of the world He came to fulfil the law He took up the teachings of Isaiah Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the prophets and they were all much more politicians than preachers-and carried them to their completion and it is not the dream of a visionary or the meaningless phrase of a mystic to say that the one and only hope for the world is to have the political teachings of physics Christ way out into its legislation Nothing to do with it, forsooth ' It has or anything to do with it. A nation's politics are but the bring expressions of a nation's faith If its politics are atheistic, it is because its faith 13 atheistic If God be divorced from its laws, then, though its churches be thronged, its heart is estranged from Him Christianity must become political, and must insist on the mind of Christ being the main factor in its balls of legislature, to save its life, it must apparently lost its life for Christ's sake and the gospels Forccntunos our Independency has protested against a State Church Have we recognised fully that when that desirable end is attained our work is not finished but only begun a We can tolerate no earthly power or institution to for 1 it over God's heritage Christ, and He alone, is the Church's heads Are we prepared to pay as dear a price to wagons fierce n warfare, to declare that Christ, and He alone, is the nation's head? Again, do we sufficiently recognise what the nations owe politically to great religious movements a Do we recognise that the unchartered liberties of these Australian lands were voiced in the thundering of Luther, and fought forby Cromwell and his Iron- sides that to Wesley and Whitfield, and the religious revivals of years gone by, we are indebted for much of what we hold so dear to-day ? But not only in our political life do we need the rule and guidance, the government of God, but even more so perhaps in our social life Look at our armies of unemployed 1 tramp, tramp, tramp, from the sun rise to the sunset in every so-called civilised land, in ever-increasing host Look at our social battles, the strikes for higher or against reduced remuneration Look at our swoiters'dons, where hope and faith die in the fierce struggle to keep body and soul together Look of the sorrows of the famished poor, whose whole existence is the prayer " Give us this day our daily bread " Look at the drink traffic fat turning on its victims the gambling fever, shining every noble impulse every first aspiration of man hood, creeping into our churches, Bonding its deadly) virus along the healthiest signs of our life the un- mentionable social evil, and then let us answer whether sociall) Christ reigns or w whether we Ina of need once again of the Man with the whip of small cords who taught us " Do unto others have would that they should do to you " Look of the fierce spirit of competition that rules to-day) in every part of industry) and every centre of life Importer ng unfit importer, producer against producer, tailor against toiler, institution against institution. Church even against Church Aenlably a world oflBh machines, with our limit against every man's and every man's against us S, if interest over where, in every other man n rival, if not afoo, unions would scorn that, practically) at least, we endorse the assertion that the only rights of man are those of the tiger The spoils to the strong, w as to the vanquished ! With the land and the many forms of industry centralised in the State, and destined to become more so from } year to year, the stream of reform has been gradually banked up to this one channel Those changes must come but whether the) come in accordance with the spirit of Christ Jesus is for us to decide Carry our Christianity into the State, insist upon the controlling power of God being recognised, and Peaceful as the day) dawn comes down when night is past," the old world will swoop into its newness of life Was it the good news that there would be a time of ease and luxury in the hereafter to compensate for the privations distress, hunger, and cold and thirst in this is No But the good news of a might) brotherhood, wherein the strong would bear the burdens of the weak, wherein no man would be left lonely and isolated to fight the cruel battle of competitive life, but where one and all would stand bravely together, and neither difference nor distinction be- known Once again, with the seer of FeineR, who hit our eyes and behold a vision, a world wherein there is perfect unity between the life of the people and the life of God, Wherein BO war or strife is found, wherein are brotherhood and love, wherein God reigns, and " I saw, as it were, a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness " Brothers it comes our feet are touching the waters of our dividing Jordan Tor- want! ye who bear the ills of the Lord During the course of the evening the following anthems were creditably rendered -" God is my Strong Salvation," "As Pants the Hart," "the Lord is Nigh and " God in our Refuge and Strength " Mr. Arthur Hankin conducted the choir, and Mr By and presided at the organ
