SYDNEY WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) O, great Sol! Salute! — Once more the sun shines out in pale gold glory, and every damp and bedraggled thing (including the sparrow) comes forth to bask in the gleaming light, to breathe the sunny invigorating air. Once more the Domain is perfumed with the perfume of the short and cutty pipe — once more it re- sounds with the laugh of the merry loafer. This was Friday last. * * * * On the edge of the gutter, at the Market-street train stop, leaning his greasy shoulders against that historic post, polished with the polish and grease and leanings of many generations, sits a larrikin, whistling softly, and regarding his — in 6pite of himself — clean toes with wonderment— a wonderment shared by his inspecting and sniff- ing rags and tatters of a broken-down-cast-off- second-hand dog, who whining with delight, catches at the sunny shadows, and running up challenges every approaching tram; then, running back, he, with warm doggy breath and pants and whimpers of doggy delight, huddles close to the boy, and the boy, oblivious of hydatids and other doggy contingencies, puts his face close to him; and says, “Wot’s up, Cully?” And Cully barks short rapid barks, and “turns round three times to catch who you may,” and licks master’s cheek with a scratchy tongue, and master hugs him tight, and says, “You’re er rum un, hain’t yer, Cully?” And Cully barks a delirious and affirma- tive “Bow-wow.” * * * * Saturday I went to the Cricket Ground to see, as I supposed; fine work on the bicycle — not that I’m enamored of the bicycle, but I’ve a pagan love of beauty, and never allow personal prejudices to interfere with picturesque effects; and what sight can be prettier than a flock of young and lovely and laughing girls flying along on their bikes like a flight of rainbow-colored chattering birds, skimming the country roads, with the graceful rush of the dipping swallows, with the swif tness of-the swift and scented breeze. * * * * But for all that, I draw the line at the frisky, married, middle-aged “scorcher.” So do you, I suppose. * * * * Well, I went to see, as per advertisement, “Ser- polette on the Gladiator Motor Cycle— this day.” Fancy, it wasn’t a unicycle (wonder is it “a” or “an” before unicycle), nor a bicycle, but just a tri- cycle! Ugly?— Yes; I hink it ugly. * * * * Well, the motor, looking like a small cooking stove or a glorified hot potato can, came along — a rolling, rushing, rattling, snorting thing, with a visible vibrato that fled up one’s spine like a streak of lightning. 1 thought the power was electric, but it smelt distressingly like kerosene. * * * * The machine whistled arid wheezed, and shrieks of delight went up when one, with a daring and stout gentleman aboard, kicked up its heels and “bucked” — positively bucked— once, twice, and. the gentleman narrowly escaped going off on his “lucky” bone. “Well, I guess I’d rather put my stamps on er yaller mule,” said a travelling Yank. * * * * Mlle. Serpolette rode no end of times round the cycle path. She is pretty— a brunette, with crisp, curly, brown hair, and a graceful figure. She wore two pretty dresses— no, not both at once: one at 2.45, one at 3.45— both most becoming, made of thin cloth, a zouave jacket, vest, full zouave pants, tan leather and grey-cloth boots, laced to the knee, a sash bound tightly round the waist, no ends. Cap?— She had no cap; but I sup- pose she wears one occasionally * * * * The ladies round me did not seem to catch on to “the motor. “No exercise,” said one. “Mere- ly sit fast and guide the thing,” said another. “I don’t like the noise,” said the champion sprinter of “What’s-er- name” Point. “Why, the great fun of biking, is to rush along like a ghost— not a sound,” said Miss This; “No chance to fall off. What’s the good of that,” said Miss The Other * * * * A pretty large crowd on the ground, but I’m afraid I was not the only disappointed one. The tearoom was full, and everybody talked, not about the motor, but about the parliamentary sensation of Friday morning, and Mr. Reid— Mr. Reid this, Mr. Reid that — Mr. Reid was all over the place. “He’s a wonder,” said gentleman; “this day last week nobody thought about him at all — now he’s on top, and going to stop there, if I’m not very much mistaken.” * * * * Talk about football! There was a carnival of football. Football on the Cricket Ground— foot- ball on the other side of the Cricket Ground — football outside the Cricket Ground — football on each side of the road — football clubs in all di- rections, and in all the flying rags that can possi- bly be imagined! The celebrated “One Shoe and No Sox” Club played the well-known “Sans Cul- ottes,” with great vivacity. All over Moore Park bands of diminutive footballers were fighting, raving, tumbling, running; screeching — a juvenile Bedlam let loose! * * * * Walking across from the Cricket Ground, Bar- rackwards, was like a promenade down a minia- ture Petticoat Lane. The ground was strewn with dirty little heaps of dirty little clothes, and dirty little dogs kept faithful watch and ward till dirty little breathless boys came to reclaim them. All the larrikins of the earth must have been there— lusty little ruffians,, who did not know or care a dump, or anything else that begins with a big D, for Rugbeian or any other rules — they kicked and hacked and smote and yelled and swore! It was all delightful. A beautiful breeze bore towards us every now and then snatches of music. The band was playing in the Barrack yard. What more could one want? The day was lovely, the grass was green. We had a great time — the larrikins and I. * * * * Apropos of Serpolette — Serpolette of the cycle takes ones thoughts naturally to Serpolette of “Les Cloches de Corneville.” Saturday night I looked in at the Criterion— rehearsal in full blast — nearly everyone on hand— Signor Hazon, with criticising eye and ear, was accidentally walking “up stage” behind the chorus, to hear if the back row was singing; Mr. Asprey was beating time with any amount of energy, and Mr. Benham was controlling the stage with much vigor of style and severity of demeanor. * * * * You know, I was forcibly removed from the exe- cutive and the stage direction by my estimable friend “Influ.” I am glad to find so capable a director as Mr. Benham in my place. The per- formance is certain to be an excellent one. * * * * “Fancy,” says Mrs Maguire, “the Evening News” has given us 500 posters!” “What do you think?” says Miss Josephine Deakin. “Mr. Wood- house says he can’t get his wig without a writ- ten order from the committee.” * * * * Good gracious! If by any chance the commit- tee did not, or forgot, or neglected, to give the order! Imagination fails to grasp the possibili- ty of Mr. Woodhouse playing Grenicheux without a wig! * * * * The Tempe Ball was, as usual, the ball of the season; and most delightful — soft music; dreamy waltzes, soft lights, cosy corners, meetings of friends long parted and cosy chats, superb decora- tions, a forest of leaves and flowers — lots of love- ly women and smart frocks. The galleries were well attended, and the Swiss dance (arranged un- der the direction of Mrs. Prendergast) was evi- dently a great attraction. I went upstairs to see it— such a pretty sight. * * * * There were three sets — Mrs. Lassetter’s “Na- val” set, Mrs. Benjamin’s “Federation” set, and Mrs. Prendergast’s “Gainsborough” set. The sets were separated by huge garlands of green, stretched across the hall, and held by stalwart sailors. The Swiss dance is a sort of glorified country dance. One part is splendid— All the gentlemen go down on their knees and clap their hands and applaud and worship a dainty little lady who, led by an all-conquering swain, passes down the centre, and regards the kneeling ones ? with scorn. After a bit, it is the turn of the ladies to kneel— and that’s where the fun comes in. * * * * The dance “went” very well. To be sure, there was a little difference of opinion in the “Federa- tion” set— but, considering the subject illustrated, that was only to be expected. * * * * Lovely dance comes off on Friday night — Prince Alfred Yacht Club Ball, given by the Commodore and Mrs. Samuel Hordern. * * * * What a magnificent house at Her Majesty’s for the Charity Matinee! I went in for half an hour to see the “Romeo and Juliet” scene, and was much amused, Juliet being played with an, “Ah, there; strike you with a feather,” sort of mo- dernity that was infinitely soothing to a sad-co- lored mind not yet recovered from the suffering consequent on the referendum results. * * * * Juliet’s light-heartednees was counterbalanced by Romeo, who was lugubrious. But I understand I his performance was influenced by impending in- fluenza. * * * * I think Mr. Knight must have been getting off a little joke on a certain theatrical critic when, in talking over the character of John Strong in “The Christian,” he said, “I am greatly fascinated by the character. It appeals to me in a peculiar way. I find that all characters which have anything of fatalism about them do.” * * * * Now I consider Mr. Knight’s art is external — very— and not at all tinted with evidences of psy- chological research. * * * * The popular hero of the afternoon was Harry Rickards. Next to him came Beggy Pryde. “Why, she’s quite an actress,” said a society lady in astonishment, also in the dress circle. “Of course,” said I. “Her mother, Jenny Hill— who taught her — was one of the greatest artists in her particular line that the variety stage has ever seen.” “Jenny Hill? Never heard of her,” said the S.L. “Not the ‘Vital Spark?’ ” said I. “No,” said she, and shook her head sadly. “Good-bye,” said I. “Good-bye.” said she. * * * * I don’t like the idea of the matinee money be- ing divided. I think the performance should be repeated, and the receipts of one given to the poor wives and children of the lost sailors, and the receipts of the other given to the theatrical charities. * * * * Mr. G. A. Edwards did great execution among the programme-purchasers. * * * * The English papers, May 20, are full of the details of Gladstone’s death. You remember his little and favorite grandchild, Dorothy Drew? She don’t wear shoes or stockings, and struck up a great friendship with Li Hung Chang when he was in London. She has been staying at Ha- warden Castle during all the trying time of the ill- ness; but, of course, did not understand the gra- vity of the situation; and, being met in the Park the day previous to the death, was asked by a neighbor, “Have you seen your grandfather this morning?” “Oh, yes,” said Dorothy, and her eyes filled up. “But gran’pa don’t know me now.” * * * * In the London “Daily Telegraph” of May 21 is an article, “Mr. Gladstone and the Stage.” In that article there is exactly thirty lines about a certain person named Emily Soldene. In that ar- ticle there are two letters of Mr. Gladstone’s re- produced. One is written to Charles Kean, dated “Carlton House Terrace, July 14, 1858.” The other is written to Emily Soldene, and is dated “Hawarden Castle, Chester, May 17, 1883.” * * * * If you think Emily Soldene is not nearly off her head with joy and pride at being so associated with the memories of this greatest of great men you are mistaken, because she is. * * * * In a letter received on Tuesday from my daugh- ter is a little bit of local color: * * * * “London, May 26. Yesterday, being Derby Day, was simply disgusting in the weather line, quite like November — yellow and dark — and all the world had the ‘hump,’ except the ‘bookies.’ They were making their pile in once. Fancy that out- sider Jeddah winning! . . . Poor old Glad- stone. Everybody is so sorry about his death they forget his mistakes. I expect the funeral will be a tremendous function. We shall have to get up at 6 o’clock on Saturday morning. Our tickets are for the west entrance of the Abbey, and the ‘Earl Marshal’ officially informs us we ‘must be in our places by 10 a.m.’ Dear me——” * * * * I have some charming news. Miss Helen Mac- kenzie, second daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Doug- las Mackenzie, is engaged to be married to Mr. Laurence Brown, of Cooerwull, Bowenfels. * * * * The Anniversary Plain and Fancy Dress Dance given by Mr. and Mrs. Schnieder to their em- ployees at Needs’s Rooms on Tuesday night was a capital and cosmopolitan one. All the languages were there; it was like the Tower of Babel. Mrs. Schnieder had a beautiful bouquet presented by her girls. “Such goot girls,” said she. No end of costumes — grisettes, Italian peasants, pescatori, contadini e contadine, Moors, modern Greeks, clas- sic Greeks; Medora, with a jewelled belt very low down — of course, a frock as well; Corsicans, flower girls, sailor girls, French Kings, French clowns, America and Spain—but nothing awful happened— a Queen of May, ladies of the Empire, ladies of the Directoire. * * * * It was a bright and pretty scene, and the boys and girls had a time. They danced with esprit. The boys lifted the girls off their feet and swung them round and round, quite la mode de Paris. Toujours gai; zip, zip; O, la la.” * * * * Then such a supper! You should have seen the supper. Well, that’s what I did— “saw” the supper, and went one better — came away. * * * * The most indefatigable dancer of the whole crowd was Papa Uhde, of Market-street. No keep= ing him still — with all the prettiest girls, too. * * * * The Woollahra Benevolent Society’s dance at the Paddington Town Hall, same night, was a very smart affair indeed. I had no ticket, but the man “on” the door said he thought “I was free of everywhere,” and let me in. Polite, wasn’ it? Such a lot of people; such a success. * * * * Such pretty dresses. Mrs. Prendergast wore a most lovely dove-colored satin, with shining trim- ming that gave out little glints of light at every movement. The skirt was trained, and quite plain; elbow sleeves, and long white kid gloves. A row of beautiful, pearls. and a diamond necklace made up a perfect toilette. Mrs. Slattery wore a floral brocade, cerise velvet, and diamonds; Mrs. S. Hordern, brocade and diamonds; Mrs. Caro, black and pink velvet and diamonds; Mrs. G. A. Edwards, a pretty chick black dress; Mrs. William son, fawn brocade and diamonds; Miss Slattery, pink; Miss Craven, blue; Miss Caro, rose-pink; Miss Summerbelle, grey brocade and Maltese lace. No end of people and frocks impossible to remem- ber. * * * * Nice supper; the tables beautifully decorated with banks of camellias. I stayed there to sup- per — went in with Mr. Slattery. Mrs. Slattery went in with Mr. Tom Roberts; and the feature of the supper was Mr. Sam. Hordern’s specially fatted-up-for- the-occasion “bronzewing” turkeys. * * * * Coming slowly down the Town Hall steps from the Lottie Hyam Benefit meeting the other day, a lady buttonholed me. “Wait a moment,” said she. “I want your advice. A friend of mine — one of the dearest women in the world— has just pre- sented her husband with twins, a girl and a boy. Do you think I should congratulate or condole with him?” * * * * I wasn’t equal to the occasion— no experience. Which do you think she should do? * * * * All the Charity Balls I have had to do with have been managed and run solely by ladies, and when a gentleman tells me about a ball managed and run solely by gentlemen it simply takes my breath away. But it’s a fact, and the ball is the Free- masons’ Benevolent Institution Ball, and takes place at the Town Hall, Thursday, July 28; and it seems to me, from the number of tickets already sold, that all Sydney and all Sydney suburbs for miles round will be there— “all there,” in fact. * * * * Boggs: “There is something about the woman’s face that reminds me of a recent work of art.” Soggs: “Perhaps it’s the paint.” * * * * Prestidigitateur: “Now, my little man, are you quite sure there is nothing in your pocket?” Tommy: “Yes, sir — positive: The rabbit you put dere before de show got away.” * * * * Visitor: “And which do you intend to be when you grow up — a pirate like Bully Hayes or a high- wayman like the Kelly Gang?” Bobby: “Neither. I intend to be a politician like papa.”
