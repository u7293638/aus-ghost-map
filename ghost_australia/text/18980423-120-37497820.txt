POt√≠TKY. SO LITTLE DONE. So much to do, ao little done ! ^ In sleepless eyes I MW tbe sun ; ,. His beaming disk in darkness lay, The dreadful ghost of Yesterday. So little done, so much to do ! The morning shone on harvest new, ? v In eager light I wroucrht my way, And breathed the spirit of To-day. So much to do, so little done ! The toil is pa&t;, the rest began ; Though little dono and muoh to do, To- morrow earihand heaven are new. ' . -J. J. PlATT.
