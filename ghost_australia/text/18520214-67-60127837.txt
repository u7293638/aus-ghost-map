THE HARP OF THE EMPIRE. ON A MOVEMENT OF BEETHOVEN. BY THE LATE GEORGE JAMES MACDONALD, ESQ. Aye, once more touch the strings, That Memory may feed upon that strain, And over-live again The days, When the Heart gloried in those golden lays, Which give the Spirit wings. Simple, yet how profound The feeling that indues this deathless air!-- Did heart-ache, or despair, Or dream Inspire its notes, that spread so charm'd a stream Of melody around? Sometimes the sweet notes swell Soft as a sigh, the semitone of thought!-- Yet sometimes seem they fraught With Fate,-- Storm-toned, spirit-rousing, jarr'd with Hate, And booming like a knell;-- Stern, massy, wild, and dark, The clashing chords of harmony unite,-- While o'er their mournful flight One note Of melting sweetness doth serenely float, Like love-call of the Lark. Those gloomy chords at last Roll wave-like through "the caverns of the mind" And mystically wind Their way Into dark thoughts, that rise in drear array,-- The ghost-dreams of the Past. And then, the plaintive tone Of pastoral pipe, or mountain brook, or bird, In tranced thought is heard,-- Until, The faint heart fails beneath the Master's skill, And yearns to be alone. Yet, Lady! yet, once more, Bring back that banded train of hopes and fears,-- The passion of past years,-- The spell, That ruled my Being in its inmost cell, And then, sweet friend! give o'er.--
