Meadow Sweet. In Summer fields the meadow sweet Spread* its white bloom around the feet 0£ those who pass in lore or play The golden hours of holiday, And heart to answering heart can beat ~ Where grows the simple meadowsweet. Embosomed in some cool retreat The long seed grasses bend to meet The stream that murmurs as it flowt 1 Bongs of forget me not and rose; [ The filmy haze of noon tide heat i Is faint with scenes of meadow aweet. Ah, lore 1 do you know meadowsweet? Does some pale ghost of passion fleet Adown this dreary lapse of years, 80 roid of loTe, so full of fears 7 Some ancient, far off echo greet The once loredname of meadow iwcttt An Ingenious Swindle.—A swindle recently detected is conducted as follows: A cheque, say for ten guineas, is obtained from m depositor at a bank, and a blank cheque exactly like the filled-in cheque is secured. The two cheques arc laid one upon the other ■o that the edges are exactly even. Both cheques arefthen torn irregularly across, and in such a way that the signature on the filled cheque appears on one picce and the amount and name of the payee on the other. The cheques hating been held together while being torn, of course one piece of the blank cheque will exactly fit the other piece of the filled cheque. The swindler then fills in one piece of the blank cheque with the name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, say one thousand pounds, takes it with the piece of genuine cheque containing the sig nature of the bank, and txplains that the cheque was accidentally torn. The teller can put the pieces together, and as they fit txactly, the chanecs are that he will think the pieces are parts of the same cheque, and become • victim to the iwindle. The trick, of course, suggests its own remedy. The teller should refuse to pay any cheque thai is mutilated.
