;DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE ANY. Among a party of country cousins "'doing" the metropolis a short time back was a gentleman with rather .Puritanical sotions about theatres. :Nevertheless, rather than interfere "with the ?pleasure of the party, he ,consented to go out for the evening 'with them. One night they went to a play-one tof those hilarious adaptations from 'the French where a staid householder of mature years goes off for an even ing's revelry, and makes the most of it in an atmosphere of champagne and general liveliness. As the performance progressed and the fun grew faster and ,more furious the other members of the party looked at the man of rigid views with considerable solicitude. Might he not rise from his seat and denounce thel performance. But no; he sat there quietly enough, his face fixed in a look of frozen in stentness, and his eyes glaring through :his eye-glass at the spectacle beyond the footlights. However else he might regard the performance, he certainly wasn't amused. Not a. ghost of a smile ;crossed his face. He sat stolidly through it all to 'the fall of the cur tain. When they were all going down the stairs one of the party had-i the temerity to ask him how he liked the performance, and the .others -waited, with bated breath to hear 'his Wither-i iing denunciation. '"Why," he pleasantly answered, "it -was the funniest thing I ever saw in Smy life." "B-but," stammered the astonished 'questioner, "you didn't laugh-you 'didn't even smile all through the per 'formance." "No," answered the other, "I didn't 'laugh because I was afraid I might 'lose some of it."
