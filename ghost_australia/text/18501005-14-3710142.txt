At the village of Farringdon situated about nine miles from Bristol, on the road, to Wells, a young woman, named Ann Cromer, the daughter of a master mason now lies in a complete state of catalepsy, in which extraordinary trance-like condition, should she survive till next November, she will have been for no less than thirteen years. During the whole of this extended period she has not partaken of any solid food, and the vital principle has only been sustained by the mechanical administration of fluids. Although of course reduced to almost a perfect skeleton, her countenance bears a very placid expression.' Her respirations perceptible, her hands warm, and she has some indication of existent consciousness. Upon one occasion,, when asked if suffering from pain, to squeeze the hand of her mother, placed in her's for that purpose, a slight pressure, the mother avers, was plainly distinguishable and frequently, when suffering from cramp, she has been heard to make slight mans. About sixteen weeks after the commencement of her trance, she was seized with lock-jaw, which occasions great difficulty in affording her nourishment. The''.unfortunate, young woman is twenty-five years of age, and has been visited, by a great number of medical gentle man who, however hold but no hopes of her late- master recovery, Nevis of the World, May 12.

He was dead in d as being from 120 to 130 feet in length, and of proportionate bulk, with the head of a serpent, which he carries, when in motion, five or six feet out of the watc.

In winter they were fed on turnips, and housed in sheds at night when the weather was bleak and the air unkindly But on the roof spring of grass, which shelter pi singles famously on in-field find, the breeders were removed to their present location just as lambing time was appealing. And the" consequence has been, tins are used to every dam excepting OUP, the only black sheep in the lot, which has three followers a super i im ity in fecundity which, perhaps, the blackness li rselt consults a compliment paid to her colour. But be this as it may, there they all are, a right happy" family, fifty-three limbs to twenty-six minutes udders full of milk, and the quislings tins drain them so well-grown, strong, and frisky, that within the lapse now of a few days competition will arise among certain tradesmen in purchasing stock so sale at premium prices. - Dunifties Cou) ter. _ " One story of the g rent fire at Cihfoi iva," says the Times, " is far too good to be lost.
