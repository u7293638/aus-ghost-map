TUL W iTCHl KS ON Tlir BALI IC (Ir n Ils Da I j News J Tir F month of May is alwa\s the season of sus pense it St Petersburg-the time ^.hcn it is siid the restless Czar, who sleeps only hy snatches, looks out, or goes forth, almost before an)body else is stirring to observe the aspect of his watery reilm, and sec which way the wind is The suspense is ibout the wind , and o\en now, in this most solemn spring season of all the 57 he lias known, the movements of the wind are of more consequence to Nicholls than even those of the allies A long continuance of strong cast winds w ould domorc for him than all the prcpa rations he can make A rush of west wnd would rum him more speedily and thoroughly than all his united enemies could, w tthout its help The suspense is about this Ihe fog i. the token that the crisis is at hand The fog precedes the breaking up of the ice in the Nc\a , and it wdl be succeeded by those singular twilight nights, of unequalled beauty, which ire the only charm of the dc-ol-itc region in which St Petersburg stands While the fog lasts the sentinels on the watch towers in the city look out in lain, some , towards Lake Ladoga, some up the Neva, some | towards the sea They can hear something, but sec nothing So it is with the Czar, listening in hm bnlcony, and with the commandants at S\eaborg ami at Cronstadt, and perhaps with our " Charley * walking the deck and talking to himself What he is listening for is the arrivtl of the French squadron which will enable him to proceed to his woik when the fog curtain rises What the Russians arc listening for is, first, the wind To aomo it comes sighing over the peaty plains which stretch to the margin of the gulf, whence thoy look like a mere drift upon the waters Over that batren bleak expanse the wind comes sighing through the rushes, with an occasional bark of tho wolf, or bursts of th_¡ din of the water fowls in the pools which ore already melted To others the wind comes vibrating Uko mournful music through the pine forests, which, surrounding the cnpital with their black belt nowhere further off than 20 mdea, approach much nearer in some directions These are sounds which come to the ear on May nights when the wind is from any point of tho compass, for there aro swamps and pine forests every where It is the voice of the waters that the watchers listen for with hearts that stand still As long as the hollow moaning goes on, the moaning of the imprisoned winds below the ico, the suspense is complete Sooner or later comes the crack, which tells that the hour of crisis has come The cracks of the ice are naturally most impressive, and sound the loudest in the night lhc Czar and his sentries arc already on the watch but now the citizens rise and look out in vain through the fog Some dress and go to the whan es, though it is much too soon to conjecture how hi¿h the witera will rise \e_.t comes the crash of the ice, dm cn up in heaps in the liver 01 against the wharves , jnd then the more anxious sound -the swish of the driven waters The thing most desired is a moderate cast wind and this is what usually happens A violent cast wind brings down the inland ice ind flood too fist, and every inch that the waters rise above the iron rings m the granite cmbatil ment is _o much danger Hut the fearful thing is a strong west wind turning back the flood on its way to the gulf Then it is Jess the swash of waters pour nig down tlian the roar of the sea coming up , and when the tides meet the consequence is what the world saw in 1821 lhc vessels tint were not capsized by the meeting of the floods were carried over the whines and stranded on the sands which were ar ible field.» the day before lhc nine rivers and seven canal» on which St Petersburg is seated all overflowed at once, and the flood poured into the upper chambers of the best homes m lhc capital At Cionstadt a largo vessel was drifted into the main street of the town and left there Every successive year adds to the peril of such i chance for every )car docs bt Pctcrsbuig settle lower m the swamp Amidst the stag nant silence maintained there about all dis agreeable ficts, this very disagreeable fuct is well understood lhc mallet is heard dnv ing new piles íncess inlly-that is a sound that cannot be muffled The blocks of granite on the quavs settle une |uallj that is an irrcgulantj winch the martinet Czir hunself cannot prohibit or punish lhc walls of palaces crack and hovels sink down cntlwajs into the boj and all the world may sec them meit down or be shored un The dcstruetion will be horr ble some dav und every inhabi tant knows it and onlj hopes that the place may last his time But if a ue.t wind should cirrj up not the sea onlj but tho^e who ure now riding that sea- what then s Tins is what the C/ar is listening for , the one other sound-the boom of cannon-which might for once ri\ il m terror the roar of the sea Tram Cionstadt IG miles off the spire ofthe Admiralty ind the glitter mg cupolas of St Petersburg may be seen on a clear daj Cronstadt is nearer to St Peters burg than Gravesend is to london Trom St Petersburg the boom of such cannon as wo have sent there may be heard from Cronstadt if we have the wast wind for our herald of approael By that time the fog will be gone ind the trans p irent tvv dight of th it 1 ititudc will have set in 1 he admirals w ill then have no more time for lia tening like the Czar Such a chance as that wind would fill the channels for them and obviate their chief difficulty A vorj few hours of such a tide would suffice for their attempt upon Cron sladt lhc gun boats of the enemy ambushed among the islands, and watching with intense curiosity and awe the great floating fortifications that we have sent against their stationary one must not, m such a case come out unless the} would be run down and the sentries on the bastions at Cronstadt would sec with dismay how rapidly the ordmaiy watermar'ts aro dis appearing Such a wind would be the best of allies But, without it we arc disposed to be heve that Cronstadt is as is now hinted from the scene of action not impregnable Wc hear much of the shallows there but it is cer tain that the largest Russian ships of war arc built at St Petersburg as far as the hulls are concerned and then brought into the Crons'adt harbours to be finished Ihcj arc brought by the old fashioned machinery of carrels down the river and then by means of the great ship canal at Cronstadt into the heart of thnt place That canal-the one running norn the Middle Harbour-holds ten large ships of war it once lhc shallows before Vere were thought to be an insurmountable difficult) before Sir C îsapier made a wreck of that manellous fortification Wc shall soon sec whether with the added re sources of 11 >ears of naval improvement he cannot deal with the shallows of Cronstadt Ihe Czar permits no sounding of the Neva 1 o sound the IS cv a is death to Russian subjects, but it is given out that the average depth i. nine feet on the bar and twelve within We all know what Russian figures arc worth and we maybe sure that the shallow est depth th it can be behoved will be the one reported We know too that the range of difference be tween the highest and the lowest wator is very great and that the period of highest water is just at hand Charley knows all this and very much more, and while lie is walking the deck, and talking to himself he has Ins own pans for nuking wind and tide serve bim we may be sure 1 vcrything is suid to ser c the Napicrs (as it generally scives other people) when they are at their work And the watch at the other end of that gulf who knows all this and very much more how is it with him* Ihiis far m life he has never heard the truth on ethical subjects-has never conceived that he could be in the wrong-has never doubted his being able, if he chose his time well to do whit he would in and with the world Is the transparent twilight i f the spring night the time when the icahtj of his own mind and life is to dawn upon him * As the fog draws ofF, is it carrjmg away the mists of pissiun and delusion which have hitherto clouded his mmd - In that dim light do the ghosts of his evil deeds rise before lum, and promise to sit heavy on hi. soul to morrow * Do tho hanged come down from their gallows and the knoutcd up from their blood} bed and the buried alive from the depths )f the mi io md the culed from the shores of the Polar Sea* Arc the w omen of Warsaw there demanding their children with heart broken voices > Do the in sane shake their chains at him can noble and scif for once ßpeak thor minds to him * Does the ' sick man not dead, come and show him his brawny arm * Is this tho vigil that the despot keeps while listening for the boom of our cannon ' If so he is calling on all his saints to help him But to the hollow hearted saints and diviner beings than saints, aro but ghosts also To so great a sinner, in the hour when fear brings conviction, there is nothing present but his eins-the whole array of them-promising to ' sit heavy on his soul " ,
