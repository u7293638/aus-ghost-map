PANTOMIME IN PARIS. (Macmillan's Magazine.) Revival of pantomime seems not improbable, a revival which might restore to the world a half-forgotten pleasure For pantomime though it has never died, has yet dwindled, and outside the borders of Italy its professors are few arid obscure In England its golden ago was the last century, and Garrick himself had a proper appreciation of the artist who though masked and mute confined his quick intent, And told in frolic gestures all he meant Nor did the art fill rapidly into desuetude Then when the Theatre des J uinmbules vas at the top of its prosperity, an English clown mailed Poburau himself, and many were the pantomimes played after the English fashion Then came a period of decline The down, associated most intimately with a hot poker, was given a voice, and the harlequin alone pi son of a dignity of stony silence Of late j learn the art was restored to London by Paul Martmotti, an admirable actor, (Unlike for comedy or tragedy, the a is born with the flour on his face, and who has modified the stem traditions of Milan by an observation and picturesqueness all his own In Ti Tree, on the other hand, the history of panto mime is summed up in the single name of Poburau, and it is fortunate that, at the very time when Severin is giving in a vision of the but once practised on the Boulevard du Temple a serious history is published of the Theatre des funambules Thus you may correct your impression of the stage by the study of doi moments, and revivify the ancient records by the exquisite performance of an artist Not for the first time has Peburau won the honour of biography He was still acting (at 5 francs a week when Julis Janm published the life which was nothing else than a breathless panegyric And the printed applause of Gautier, Cliampfeurj, and Glabgny is sufficient to keep his Paine green But M Pcricaud is loss a eulogism than a historian Though he yields to none in admiration of his hero, he has proved this admiration not by the min. recital of the artist's graces but by the patient collection of all such documents as may illustrate his career Nothing has escaped his diligent search-not a play) bill, not a contract, not a single cutting from the press and you will estimate the difficulty) of his toil if you remember how ephemeral is the life of a popular theatre At the outset a colleague of Doburau's own, none other than the greitVautier, came to his aid with a portfolio of notes, which he has set forth with admirable fidelity His book, in brief, is rather a quarry than a marble slab, but in this quarry you may find all the material for a perfect monument Jean Gaspard Baptiste Pcbmau, then, was born to a family of acrobats in 1706 It was in Bohemia that he first saw the light, and the birthplace was appropriate to be renowned 11 gipsy His early years were spent 111 ceaseless Roumania's up and down Europe Wherever his father could find a pitch there the piece of carpet was spread, and there his brothers tumbled to the strumming of a guitar They were known at over) fan in France and Germany, and more than once they travelled as far as Constantinople to astonish the Grand Turk The elder brothers, Nievuienbik and Etienne, were re- nowned aerob its and unrivalled dimora on the tight rope but Gaspard, whose genius was top evid by fate for a higher employ, was clumsy at the double turn, and could never Dando his

family was tired from town to town, from country to country, making a scant) hung and sleeping under the stars Its renown was no greater than that which commonly falls to the lot of the tr i\ oiling acrobat, and for all the father's primulas trade the name of Dcburau was still unknown, when in 1 bl7 1 lucky chance brought the gipsies to Paris, and Gaspard, the despised and maladroit, found the opportunity which (emus never kicks The Theatre des Funambules, immortal to-day, was then but a year old 1st abUsed by one Borhaud, a butterman, in desperate muir) with Madame Saqui, whose acrobatic

brilliant price Whatever reputation the theatre possessed was confined to its own quarter It was the haunt of all those who lived in the neighbourhood of the Boulevard du Temple, and was no better known at the interior of the Faubourg S line Germain than if it had been hidden away in the dusty corner of a country town But those who went on 0 came again a truth, they sat night after night in their shirt sleeves applauding the favourites and gazing open mouthed at the recent antics of the downs And when the curtain fell they would follow their heroes to the wineshop across the way, and feed their vanity by it furtive approach to go mus m unless the trappings of the theatre were the simplest, a few rough boxes were reserved for the cm sons who came from the other side of the water,

left the theatre after his engagement, and until his death, in 1910, he preserved as an unalterable loyalty to his art and his management, a loyalty ill enough required by a salary of 15 francs a week Once he was invited to join the opera but he instantly) repulsed this offer of wealth and glory, and he died almost on the stage he had made his own, after an ovation from the whole suburb, which with its quick susceptibility 1 view that its day Smith was making his first appearance His gentle life was disturbed by a single incident-a trial for murder In a moment of justified angel he raised his cane to a rascal who had insulted his wife ; the rascal died, and Dcburau was righteously and triumphantly acquitted For the lest, him history is the history Of pantomime his career is the career of Pierrot, that way and creature, whose Homes face and changing moods, as we know them to day, were the invention of Gaspard Poburau From the moment that he play) ed his first part (n " Haileqtiiu Modoem " his success was never in doubt And the success was no more than his achievement mented At a blow he transformed the part of Pierrot, who, having from immemorial time been the victim, suddenly become the aggressor, and kicked Cassandra up and down the stairs as he would The plays wherein he was cast gave infinite opportunities to his grotesque genius, and to those innumerable i outrages of character and temper which since his time have been the very essence of Pierrot By turns he was simple and cunning, idle and active, mis thieves and soft hearted, a glutton, a thief, a braggart, ingenious iii v. up 6 in the satisfaction of his tastes and even pathetic in his disappoint month. An admirer line described him 119 to simple-minded Satan turned buffoon and this covers but a corner of his character There is scarce one of his parts in which pathos also is not evident, and that tragedy, near ally to the ridiculous, which drowns laughter in tears Nor was he careless in aught that concerned Pierrot He changed his costume that he might the more lofty) realise his ideal Having replaced the tight jacket, that we know from Watteau, by a blouse, he disdained the big collar of convention that he might get full advantage from his long neck, and more wisely) still discard the hat which throw a deep el adow upon his white face and deprived it of half its expression Now, the name's face is the focus of his art, and nothing should dark in this mirror of terror and pity, of laughter and chicanery) To Dcbrirau a grimace was a flash of wit which he would sacrifice to no habit of the stage and if one jot of his eloquence escaped the audience the lapse was due neither to the k of thought nor to ignorance of his el ift And to-day, after half a century, his example is still fresh Though you may recover his per footions in the eulogies of his contemporaries, though the few lithographed portraits which remain suggest at once his elegant sprightliness and the quick movement of his expressive features, it is in the Ch and doubts " as interpreted by Severin that you best realise the achievement of Gaspard Peburau for not only does Sey our appear in a role created by the master, he plays his part in strict accordance with the master's tradition He is not an actor who for the moment has suppressed his v voice , he is a name, and nothing but a most, rich in the qualities, rich even in the limitations of his art That he might be fit to speak by glance and gesture, he has crowned it in a circus no has performed the antics of an acrobat to give his limbs a proper suppleness Better than all, he has learned from the son, Charles Poburau, the father's priceless lessons Indeed, between him and the meeting arable -i runs of the funambules there is but a single bank, and his performance curious yon back to the perfection of 50 years since He is still the petulant, mischievous, ill-fated child whom Poburau discovered Heartless and tumble by turns, heedlessly lie commits his tunic and repents hereafter m terrified remorse The resurrection of the pla), contrived by M Mendes, is curious enough First played in 1841, it would doubtless have followed a hundred others into account) had it not suggested to Theophile Gautier a prodigious fanHsy The critic described it with all the gusto of a r paid imagination be compared its invention to Sha) espoare, speaking costly of " Hamlet " and Macbeth " Has set the miserable Pierrot in a dozen changing lights, and glorified his performance with so vivid an enthusiasm that he burned t bring the enchant- ing Peburau back to the stage It is in this impassioned with is not in the cold prose of the original, tint M Mendes had sought his inspira- tion and despite the intervening years, despite the limelight, despite the sumptuous environs night, you forget the four s Bergeres and transport yourself to the Theatre des funambules, where for twopence you smelt the sawdust and covered your eyes before the dazzling brilliance of Bengal lights When the curtain goes up Pierrot is discovered hanging to a lamppost, in the hope that he may soften the heart of his lady, Musidora who pom and misery depicts I upon his whitened face suggest a hopeless passion and approaching death , but cunning triumphs, and no sooner does Must dora enter with CassimIro than she pities first and then adores Spiodil) Tioirotis out down and restored to a life which he had not the smallest intention to desert for indeed, the hanging wall but a trick, and he presently grows the friendly lamp-post with a gesture of contempt His happiness, however, is fleeting Musidora invites him to a bill, and he, poor devil, accepts, though he knows too well that he cannot present himself without a disguise And how shall he, who has not a halfpenny in his pocket, purchase a coat wherewith to cover the white blouse of his calling ¿ Left alone to find some way of salt allow he hears the cry of the old clothes' man, 'Chaml Chalmers" Ch and habits' In vain he implores the ancient to give him a coat the Town will make no present without his proper reward, and Pierrot, driven to despair, seizes a sword which hangs at the Jew's shoulder, 1 ills him with his own weapon, rifles his pack, and throws the body into a chair Illa remorse lives but an instant Has he not a coat and shall be not cut a triumphant figure before Ino Musidora J Ho summons a barber, lost his hair trimmed, and prepares for the festival But even before he can start on his journey he hears with horror the haunting cry, 'Grand habits ' 'CE and district and sees the li hairdresser transformed to the spectre of his victim shuddering with fear he throws himself upon the wraith, believes himself the foot of a nightmare and sets off again with a good heart to j) i) homage to the id) The scene changes to the ballroom, and none dances with lighter gaiety) than Pierrot, from whose mind the mere memory of his crime is effaced But retribution is only halting and when he would replace his emptied glass it is the old clothes men, transfixed with the blood-red sword, who holds the hay Thus he w rivers between the happiness of Musidora's love and the horror of the ghostly voice which none hears save himself faster and faster whirls the dance, until Pierrot, wild with excitement, picks a quarrel with Gossundrc and, insulting his rival, has no resource but to accept a challenge Once more the stone changes, this time to the field of battle Pierrot and Cassandra armed with their seconds, and the duel begins with scrupulous formality But no sooner has Pierrot driven his adversary from the ground than he hears again the voice of the murdered Joe, who this time clutches the hapless victim in his arms, transfixes him with the broad) sword which caused his own death, and after a Mephistopheles waltz round the stage drugs him to hell a fitting comer for the transformation scene such is the bare outline of the pantomime which suggested to Gautier ' Macbeth " and the Ghost of Bftnquo before it was slashed and docked to suit the indolent temper of a modern audience The scene in hell is a manifest absurdity), and with a more fervent faith n defeat restoration had been possible. It is difficult to imagine a better motive for the artofPiurot It possesses all those elements of sublimity and ridicule, of terror and gaiety which are essential to the art of pantomime And admirably does Sov erin play his part D doubtless he lacks the charm and suppleness which tradition ascribes to Peburau, but he knows how to shudder and he knows how to smile, and he forces his audience to mile and shudder too With his floured face and white costume ho dominates the stage, even when he hung upon the lamppost, and like all consum- mate actors he has a line presence His lucidity is perfect the words Is there, only they are not allowed to come tripping to the tongue, and the pin) games immensely from the silence Wore the argument set forth with a common problem) it would lose its mystery and with its mystery its grandeur And Scvenu himself lb never prolix His gist ins are chaste, simple, and in from the more suspicion of restlessness Though he ran dance with the maddest of them though he con make love with an ardour which is childlike and pathetic he never oversteps the bounds of rich ore i, and there is an ingenuous dignity even in his disco nature His ki moreover, is the true Pierrot's fine, and his features are as expressive us pots While on this side distortion To see him is to realise the ancient eh inn of pantomime., and to marvel once more at the death of a beautiful art _ _
