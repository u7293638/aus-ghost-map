O'shanassy; Handicapper :-Mr.. E. T. Barnard; Judge :- Mr. G. Vowles; Starter!-Mr. G. "Watson; Secretary :-Mr. N.B. D. Bond. T A ny thins more enjóyame in the way of imo weather could, not haye been wished for than that experienced last Satur day at Caulfield lipon tho opeuing day of tho Victoria. Amateur Turf Club's spring meeting. It is only since tho ¡ present secretar/. Mr. N. li. D. Bond, took the position that he now so ably illls, that this club has assumed tho prominent placo in tho turf world that it now holds, and to Bay what it-will become in the futuro isa hard matter. The course.which promises to become a very favouvito one, is prettily situated, and with the recent improvements iso most comfortable one. Ou gaining admission at tho mara en tranco, a neat gravel walk leads one to tho grand stand, which, since the lost meeting, has boen considerably im< proved by iii« addition of a most spacious and lofty luncheon and committee room on tho ground fluoi-, while upstairs aTC apartments for his Excellency tho Governor, ladies, and gentlemen. All these aro most elaborately fur nished, and far Surpas3 anything of tho kind that Wo hav« at KandwUk. lu front of the stand is a capital lawn,, and on each mia the step fi leading from tho stand aro soma noble tree ferns, similar ornaments hoing placed in each, recess at ertlioT end of the structure, which at once gives a finish to the whole. Tho refreshment arrangements, aro most complete, the caterers being Messrs. Uunslor and * Co., who succeeded in nleasinj» all. To tho left of tho en trn.nee gate a space hatfboen covered in an/1 fixed with tables, and seats, for the accommodation of inoinbcrs who wish toi have private lunches. On tho lawn and every spot available/ are found neat oiuamcutal Beats, and when these aro takoi» possession of by tho ladies, who, by the way, mustered in> lorco on Saturday, their elegant costumes have a very pleasing effect. To the right of the stand is tho saddling«, paddock, arni this, since tho recent -addition, is a very roomy one, and when every thing is finished aud well grassed' . . over, will bo most completo. A row of well-grown trees, ;, . thc shade of which is even now found bencíicia!, separates* the old from the new portions, and beyond these, in tho centre, is placed the inner ring. This is for thc purposo ol ? betting, and wilta, ready for use, all wascringwill havo to hfl' transa-efced thor«. The bookmakers aro ol conreo loud in their camplnimts. But to aiy mind it is an excellent idea,, and I hopo to eeo the Randwick authorities adopt it. Tlia sheds are woll adapted for the purpose, while the jockeys'" quarters, whou finished, will suit them well. Tho course*, liowcTcr, is a rery h'eaTy one, aud quite different to cithoi Flemington, Xandwi«k, or Hawkoabttry, and I think in na small niewsure tho .earoo kt blamable for thp.npfot in tht> many turf prophcta' calculations last Saturday. Tho at', tendance was a very good one, tho splendid weather allow ing tho ladies to come out iu force, and they were arrayed' >: in most «hitrming toilets ; and when seated on the pretty little eland, it iras n sight well worth witnessing. Sig ISxoellency tho Governor nrrirad early on tho ground, driveu out tn his lonr-in-hand .iu ti« new ehar-a-Can< lately built to kia order. His Exeelleacy remained ta witness the running for tho Amateur Challenge Cup, whiebi waa not decided till ofter 5 «'«lock. Tho programme contained six events, starting with allait milo selling raoo for which our northern di y trie t horso. Kanaka, was much fancied, and it looked a really good thing for him. Ho was, however, ncr«r ¡nit. Milparinka get-, ting away m front held a prominent position all the way-arid won comfortably by a length and a half, while tho favourita> finished fifth. On being submitted to auction thc winne» wo« purchased by Mr. D. Jones for £300, which benefited, thc club by £20i), a very good start. Tho First Handicap Hurdlq Ityçc brought out a field of 18, of which munber Rhesus and Morry Maid woro most in favour at4 toi. Red Rover pub himself out very quickJy by running round a hurdle. Gambler mada thc most of the running, bufe. Sportsman, %vho had Corrigan for a pilot, hold a good position, and going to tho front thrcoiurlongs from homo won easily at tho finish from Rhesus and Gambler. Fourteen. showed out for the Great Foal Stakes, and of thljj numhOJ*, . Cfc, lawrence, by GloriouB-Perfection, looked all over winner, being fnr superior, IIB regards nppearanco, to tl ©thors. Consequently, bo left tho paddock favourite nt "'toi, and uphold tho good opinion by winnini; comfortabl from Quality by Tho Professor from Dolores, while- Pri cious Stone (ro- cbristcned Off Colour), by liing Colo froi The Gem vas third. This over, tho candidates for tl Guineas wore eagorly scanned. Guesswork looked TCI well, as dill also Fryingpan, but Hecla, bad a light appeal Bnce, and did not look so fresh aa when I saw him put i the capital gallop oa th» tau last Tuesday fortnight .Boolka is a well-grown colt, and will ba troublesome i tho future. At the post Guesswork and Hecla were ii çlined to bo somewhat restiro, but tho word was given t an excellent start, Norfolk bei»!? tho first to move, followc "by Guesswork, tho bitter afc onco taking up tho ronni n attended by Fryingpan, Transferred, mid Norfolk. At tb half milo post Norfolk, who appeared to bc going wei. Blipped, and Davis pricking him ho jumped a hurdle tba . was on the side of tho coursa and carno down ; horse mi rider however got off uninjured, Hecla rim up to Frying pan at tho half milo, but waa Boon displaced by Boolk who appeared to lead Fryingpan into tho straight. In th tun home, however, the con of Bethnal Green and Sauccp:u -Carno away aud won by three parts of a length, the favouvit two lengths off, third, then came Aide-tlc-Cainp. Cain» <who got ba div away) Mistaken, mid Heda. I have sine . been informed by Murphy, who rodo Hecla, that tho lill; Sid not seem to liko tho black candy course nt all, wkicl appeared to slip from -under her feet. Tho Amaten . Challenge Cup Steeplechase brought out niuo starters, al .gentlemen riders. Erin was moot in favour nt 5 to 2, whili Barcoo came next nt i to 1. Tho latter ran off nt tho firs "fence, and wbon brought back his rider did not oppcar t< "caro much about pcrsoTerin¡r with him. At tho cud of i mile and a quarter Erin looked all over a winner, but Mr ' Simpson, who rodo a capital ra co on Marquis, carno in thi last half mile and lauded the old prey a winner by 10 lengths ^Thirteen started for tho Toorak Handicap, Larpent leavim tho paddock favourite. Hero again I think tho heavj going: altered results, for Larpent was never able to pac« with Verduro, by Bethnal Green from Target, who woi £'om start to finish wliilo Tho Hebrew finished second hieb, concluded a most onjoyablo day's sport.

Fryingpan, the winner of the second Caulfield Guineas, is a polt that as a-- year-old gave every promise of furnish ing into o)ic of tho best of our racers, and although highly tried ns a 2-year-old did not nm in public un to his etand ard ; this is perhaps to be accounted forby Ins fretful and at times fractions disposition. His owner, the Hon. Wm. Pearson, has always maintained that ho. waa a. good one, and oa thu* occasion lias landed o. good stake. Mr. P. I". Dakin, his trainer, who entertained an excellent opinion of him, and one who should be very familiar with tho pecu liarities of tho family, ha.s now tho gratification of having witnessed his cou oí' Saucepan defeat such good .'l-year-olds as Guesswork (winner of the S A..T.C. Derby), Boolka, and Hecla (winner of Hawkesbury Guineas and Mares' Produce Stakes). As a 2-year- old he galloped homo before the Bout h Australian filly Satmiella in the Great Foal Stakes, but during the V.R.C. Spring Meeting he failed to score a winning bracket. At tho V.R.C. Autumn Meeting he was only able to get third place for tho bires' Produce Stakes (won hy Guesswork), Basso-nio, a stahl« com panion of tho latter, Wing in front ol' him also, so that with another .year on h'm age ho has managed to avenge hia defeat. On tho same day he was second to Soli tude, having Alfander behind him, and a few weeks Inter on, journeying to Sale, ho non tba Junior Stakes, and then retired for a short, respite On his again emerging from bia rest ho appear*; to have been refreshed, aud with the assistance of Mv. Dakin's ex perience in training has won the proud title of "Guineas winner," thus adding nnothev winner to the largo bead roll of his illustrious dam Saucepan, who also gavo us Haricot, Irish Stew, Zambesi, and Mercury, all animals entitled to a niche ia tho temple of equino fame.
