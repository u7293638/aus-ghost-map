The Origin of Our National Emblems. THE ROSE. Tho wars which so long devastated Eng land wore carried ou under tho symbols of tho Red and White ILobo. Tho adherents of tho House of Lancaster chose the red roso as their mark of distinction, whilst thoso of York' choso tho white. fThe fratricidal war con tinued until the union of tho Rose by the marriage of Henry .YIL. with tho PrinceBB Elizabeth of Tork in 1486, since which time tho roso has continued to be tho emblem of England. - . ? . j ? THE SHAMROCK. . When St. Patrick landed in ' Ireland, to convert tho Irish, A.D. 432, the pagan in habitants wore ready to stone him. ' He re quested to be hoard, and endeavoured to ox plain God to. thorn as the Trinity in unity, but they did not understand him,, until ho plucked a trefoil . or shamrock from tbo ground, and said, ' Is it not as possible for tho Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be ono as for these throo loaves to grow upon n single stalk?'' 'Then,' says Brand, 'the Irish were convinced, and became converts to Christianity,' and in memory of that event they have ever since worn the shamrock as a badge of honour. '?? ? TIIE THISTLE. When the Danes invaded Scotland on one occasion they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and, in order to prevent the Scots from detecting thorn, they marched barefoot. The Dauos thought thoy should roach the camp in a few minutes, when suddenly a man who wont forward was so wounded by a stout Scotch thistle that he could not help crying out loudly with pain. This noino rousod tho camp ; tho Scots flew to arms, and tho Danes wore vanquished.. The thistle was afterwards adopted as the insignia of Scotland.
