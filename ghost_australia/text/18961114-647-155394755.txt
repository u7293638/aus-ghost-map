FULL SALVATION. Full salvation iB essential to the passion and power for winning souls. It is the propulsive force of the Christian life. Its ordinary love for souls becomes a passion for souls. The love of Christ con strains it ; a supreme enthusiasm for the work of salvation possesses it. The baptism with the Holy Ghost puts into the soul a ceaseless push ; it compels it to go ; then 'it will teach transgressors thy ways.' A full salvation that doeB not impel to, and put into the life of its possessor a restless zeal for soul saving, is not quite full. Our observation in the twenty-five years of labor, seeking to promote the ex perience of full salvation, is that, those who have given evidence of receiving it have had a consuming love for souls, and have given themselves to ceaseless effort in that direction. Full salvation is not only a- propulsive force, but also a promotive force It not only moves us to rescue the perishing, but enables us to move men toward the kingdom. It is not only the aggressive element, but the achieving element in Christian life. He who has it does not spend his strength for naught ; his labor is not in vain for souls ; ' whatsoever he doeth prospers;' 'he comes rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him ; ' barren lives become abundant lives, fruitless ministries become fruitful ministries. As rapidly as the experience of full salvation possesses the ministers and the people, so great becomes the ? evangelizing success of the church. The people to-day that are in the Blums, in the rescue mission work, and the highways and hedgeB of life, searching for and saving souls in any considerable degree, are those who are driven on by the passion for souls imparted by a full salvation. The power whioh Jesus promised when Hesaid, 'Ye shall power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you,' is the holy, efficient energy which completes salvation — the baptism with the Holy Ghost im parts. — Rev.
