S.A.J.C. FLEMINGTON MEETING. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, May 10. The second day's racing of the South Aus- <*> tralian Jockey Club, which was postponed from Thursday on account of wet weather, took place on Saturday, and though the attendance was very small at the time when the first race was run it materially increased afterwards, and when the Cup came on for decision there were at least 10,000 people pre sent, including the Governor and Lady Loch and suite. The weather was rough and cloudy, but remained fine during the afternoon, and the course was in capital going, though not conducive to fast time. The Australian Mili tary Sand performed selections during the day on the lawn, and altogether the day was a most successful one. Great interest was centred in the Cup, and large num bers inspected the candidates in the pad dock. Lord Wilton and Camerine were the first on view, sad no question could be raised as to the former'* fitness. His coat phone like 6atin, and the handsome shape of the horse caused many post-bettors to invest in bis favor. Camerine was also blooming, and liis owner was somewhat sanguine as to his chance. Britisher, despite his reputation, was penerally voted an underbred aniiiiaT, though a Iwrse of great size and turned out with T. Wil∈'E polish. Conjecture was another animal in splendid condition, but Sardios, Welcome .Tack, and Prometheus were all on the big side, and Anchorite was not within jk.uikls of his form. Lantern looked none the worse f<* his Goodwood Handicap win, and his party were very sweet to the last. Other horses, however, attracted little attention, except from their own immediate partisans, though Anglesey, Hazard, and Plausible were l>?.l;?-d upon as the most likely of die outside division to effect a coup. The mare Conjecture hardened to such an extent that she left the paddock at 3 to 1, Britisher being a point more, followed by Lantern at s's, and then came Lord Wilton at fe's. Welcome Jack was strongly supported at 100's to S, at which price Sardius was also backed. The prices of others varied from 15 to 50 to 1, and as nearly every one was backed the books must have had a good time of it. The race, which is described in detail below, resulted in the victory of Lord Wilt-in, who was followed borne by Anchorite and Sardius. The favorite, who was in front for a great part of the race, collapse! half atuile fruin hmue, while Britisher shot his bolt half-way down tire straight, Lantern giiing in just before that.
