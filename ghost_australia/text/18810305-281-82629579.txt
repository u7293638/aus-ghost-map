Humour. WHAT IT MUST COME TO; OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS HENCE. [?] in Beeton's Annual. "ANNIE, My dear, what are you doing?" said Mrs. Mohawk to her daughter. "I am sending a letter of congratulation to Bessie, mamma, but the machine will keep 'writing abont-juete's foneral, and 1. am : tired ooxreeting iU anon.'* ; '' f " Zoo Juts sot torn ad the proper atop, I .eee," iatd Mrs. Mohawk; " you have left tha Mousing stop a little. -* B*e ; nowlhare ? tornados the laU Wodding spring.

Now, I most hate this posted." . ? .i , She mi as aha spoke and tonohad an elaaixio b?H. : A slight movement ?aa heard oateiilu, and in a few moments a mechanical footman enter&J; quietly, and held oat his band far the Utter. A. spring *u touched. The figure bowed respeotfnlly, aad. taming round, glided calmlyand sitaiUy fromthe apartment. ; "Icannot think how anycftilised people ever lived ; with feUow- areatnxes far their servants," said Mrs. Mohawk, as tha figure left the room. "Oar gemots are most inexpensive,- and bo trouble.".' u;.V~ "Oh, mamma, 'deat:yon- weoUeet, the .wonittt we had Aver Jane, the self-acting nursemaid. How. aha. woitZd. take Charley and Eote oat . the wrong way till wa oiled her. She waa screwed, too tight,, the man said.? ~ ..v ?' " That is a complaint cmr anesston found in too, I beliars. Bui our mechanical cook is perfection." - . # . ''Tea, at taxi. I enall never forget tha trouble wa had when Qenexai Fisks came to dinner.. She went on atixxing the gravy till It allheal boiled away;, and &yoarecollect; the pancakes t. She would sot stop,tossing until papa undid her. < and stopped her maahineiy altogether. Poor Genarall how disappointed he was about the coffee! She stood. quite. still then, sod woaldn't work a tit!" "Yes,my dear,you are right, Servants are certainly sometimes a trouble even now. But who's that?" As Mrs. Mohawk spoke, a gentle- ring was heard in ths and a photograph sprang out. ult is Mr. Addin, mamma,** said Annie, Mushing. ."May he come in." "Certainly, dear. ~ He Is a very well-behaved young man. I Hke him very mash." .. X Annie' waited no second bidding. She touched a spring, snd a panel moved. In a few moments Mr. Addin came sliding up like the ghost ia tbe " Corricaa Brothers." He greeted'" Annie warmly/ and her mothex respectfully. " I have just been to see tbe Flying Bees,** he said. " The City Champion will win, I think. He appears vexy strong." "How far do the men fly, Mr. Addin?** asked Mrs. Mohawk. H Three hundred mflss, there aud husk, ss thsy say.' 1 was very nearly gefag up with them, but my new wings have not been sent home. It is very provoking.'* ' s "I am glad yon didn't, Mr. Adam.' Now have you anything to:tell us shout the pic-nio oh Thursday," said Annis. , " Ob, yes—l almost had forgotten,' list mo see. There will be five balloons, and Mrs. Hankey win ehaperone oars; tot I believe yoa and I ara to be in the same, balloon." ; , Here Frank Addin paused, and . Annis reddened, and said, "Is that nil?" * "Oh, not We are to go as far aa Jersey if the wind is favourable; it not,'wa will work down to where that old watering place used to be—what is it ?—Dover—yes —down to the seaside, and then crass the Channel Bridge, and so to Francs.". - \- "How delightful! "I do hope the wind win be favourable for Jersey," exclaimed Annie. ' '* ' - * ?*, x \ "But if the wind be unfavourable, yoa win not be able to return by balloon, I suppose," said Mrs, Mohawk. "Well, perhaps not; at least not all of us; C-ptain Canny is' going to pack up his sir engine, and he will carry us horns, three at a time. But I think we had better fly. It is not far." ** You mutt wrap up well, Annie.,.. I cannot have yon flying by night without a wrap in your pocket in esss of. necessity." . "I will,take care of Miss Mohawk; yon may depend upon ins,** said Addin, with a lover's glance at Annis. "My wings are very \- strong, and I eon support her.- I should like to do so,*; he murmured to himself. ??Oh, my awn wings will support mc famously," replied Annie. '., " But Xam much ..obliged to you." " -? Oh, Mr. Addin, will you-please let out a little cold air? This room is very warm, X think," sold Mrs. Mohawk. Addia turned a stop-cock, and a stream ol cold air was gently dispersed through the zoom. "I was really afraid onr bottled Solar Heat hod escaped the other day,", ssid Mr, Addin, as he sat down. -, "The house was so dreadfully warm! But it was only a caloric tube that was leaking."- -" It was fortunate it was no worse," said Mrs. Mohawk. "But must you go? Do stop to dinner; Mr. Mohawk will be vszygbd to see you." "Where is he now?" asked Frank, when he had gratefully accepted the invitation. " I hays not met him very lately." ?-"Ha ia up at the North Pels," replied Mrs. Mohawk. " I wishhe would not go to these common tourist places. Ido all 1 can, but be will persist in seemg 'life in all its phases,' aa he calls it I'm sure I will nsw' go to such a,erowded place again." "We didn't like.it at ell," cinlhmrf Annie. It was so terribly dsprai?lng at tinea It was all very well for ths first week below the exennion balloons began to rro ai th*a it became ttnbearshls even.
