They were favorable ones ; and' ^rffstill more favorable are they now. Evenafter the '? jmbstcarefeil private rehearsals '-the first pfoduc 'tipn of an entirely new piece is not the best one. .'It may at once be reiterated that^this one %as 'well. presented — more than -well.- ''' But mftiy old ^proverbs go to show that 'practice mafcesperfect,' whilst later stage ones tell us that the play was, _ '-on the second or third time, more' evenly per i£ brmed ; ihat it worked more smoothly, and so on. Well, in some such manner was it on Saturday \- laight with V. Hands Across the Sea.' Encouraged ' bytheapplause so liberally extended towards them, '-the members of the company played, their level best; and from; the star (Mr. Warner),. to the junior sujjer. all seemed determined to not only iold iiie grip they had got on the public, but to \- clin-9Fit in view of the future of a piece which' \- seems clearly ordained to please the public during 3 a considerable length of time to 'come. The calls before the curtain were as frequent as was con sistent with stage management ; and none but a' . glutton could complain of thewant of applause. Her Majesty's. — A very large and apprecia tive audience again greeted the performance, of ' Youth ' at this fashionable place of amusement on Saturday night. Now that all the 'dramatis personse- have shaken down to their several parts the piece runs 'well without a hitch — the scenery working remarkably well. The performance was continually interrupted by loud and ' prolonged bnrsts of applause, '^showing that the . popularity of the piece 'Vhas in ;no * way;;, diminished, 'but,- on the . contrary, is; iritereasurg1 with* every representation. ; The £rst'gcene, a'Tural picture of ^teeklewGJhurch was a most artistic representation tattelgFmany an old identity back^to Ms jpjiti^and hfe jsiative village.

Mx.3Jign.old and * his whole company were repeatedly applauded . . throughout, and the principal characters were ' called before the curtain, at the end of each . act. « ? New Opera House. — The revival of 'Hamlet,' . with Mr. Mi.ln in the character- -of the unhappy prince, did not on Saturday night prove of suffi cient interest to attract a good attendance at this \ house. This is to be regretted; for, whilst Mr. Main's reading -of the character presents many points about which critics will differ, he ''nevertHeless 'gives us an intelli gent, . thoughtful, , and betimes, powerful . picture of the saddened and tragic life ,of Den mark's noble prince. Mr. Main's version of the part'iras, however, fully criticised in these columns ? on. the occasion of ? his recent season ait Her Majesty's. It is needless, therefore, to enlarge on the character in detail; sufficient, will have been said when it is stated . that the principal speeches and well- known utterances belonging to Hamlet aroused the enthusiasmof the audience, by .at' least, the thoughtful- handling, apparent. Perhaps Mr. Miln's most powerful effort was afforded in the meeting between Queen Gertrude and himself. The company which sup ported Mr. Miln on Saturday night discloses a different set of names to that which sur rounded ' him. in his first Sydney produc tion. The ' Ophelia was Miss Maggie. Knight, who, throughout the various stages , of the character, did not seem to be placed at any noticeable disadvantage. Mr. Greenaway doubled the parts of Laertes and First Player, in both of which lie worked hard and gave satisfac ? tion-' Miss* Kate Douglas was a successful Queen, whilst the character of King Claudius, , in the- Tiands of ' Mr. «T. P. West gave evidence of study. In the . dual characters of first grave-digger and the ghost, Mr. . Eobert Greville was seen. to advantage. Miss . Louise Jerrett, as the player' Queen, Mr. Athol wood as Horatio, and M*5 Welsh, as Polonius, acted carefully. Much praise 'cannot be accorded to the scenic. and stage appointments. Cbitebion.- — ' Hans* the Boatman' was again -, instrumental, in -filling the Criterion on Saturday i night. The Hansm Mr. Arnold is still the same dear, creature that Jie first presented ithe ASis tralian public with.- ? ?

Those who were fortunate v- -enough to be present were vastly entertained, v:r aid their pleasure was expressed by their con \ :. ±. tinned cacchination. ' 'New.HatMaeket Hall. — Mr. Harry Biekards ' and-hisrCompanys. are appearing in the musical comedy '-Ma-in-Law,' in the course of which a \- plethora of songs, dances, instrumentation, and ? general jollity is introduced. . Added to these are the marionettes which cause ' laughter long and loud.' Mr. Bickarde; in Ms comic impersonations is repeatedly ? encored. Miss Kate Lawrence in her songs and dancing meets' with marked expres sions'^ipf approval. The Misses Ada Dalroy, Georgie Devoe, Marion Constance, and Kate Rickards-Leete, receive encores for their respec- tive specialities. Fred. Davys, James Bell, and Wm. Woodhead complete a strong programme of attractions. Alhambra Mussic Hall. — Excellent business has prevailed at this house pi entertainment through out the past week, and 'the very strong bill put forward, consisting of the . Tyrolean warblers and -the pantomime, has given entire satisfaction. 'Songs and dances abound and follow each other L in quick succession, and the audience are kept in ' . v a continual bubble of hilarious enjoyment. En j cores are consequently frequent, and the large ?''. staff of performers vie with each other in their ? 'i- endeavors to amuse. There is no gainsaying the \ fact of Mr. Frank Smith having struck a big bonanza with his present attractions. Sib Joseph ^Banks. — The Sir Joseph Banks \- . Hotel gardens Tsfere crowded on Sunday afternoon, ^ when a sacred' and classical concert by talented ; , artists, under th& direction of Mr. E. Lockhead, tvjwas provided Dy that enterprising amusement 'Caterer, Mr. Frank Smith. The grounds, as, ' indeed, they always are, were of themselves a . ?'?great attraction to visitors from- town ; and the special trams that ran a* frequent intervals dur ' ' ' -?

It is^an '?'' astonishing fact about this well-known suburban. pleasure resort that jfolks';neyer' seem to tire of visiting1 it, and every tram conveys to' the grounds persons reager to renew their acquaintance with the beauties of the gardens. , .

Manit. — As usual on -Sunday, the principal and- popular watering place on 'our 'beautiful harbor ' was besieged with pleasure seekers, of whom the aquarium receives its share. The numerous attractions provided at this place of amusement drew considerable attention, while the concert in the1 afternoon was listened to with marked appreciation. * Googee. — Although the attendance at tMs aquarium yesterday was not as immensely large as is usually the case, there were over a thousand people present during the day. Considering the very threatening and unpropitio-os state of the weather, it appeared remarkable that even this number would venture out. But upon getting within the ; aquarium enclosure one ceased to wonder as the attractions there presented were so numerous and choice that they could not fail to elicit the appreciation or alL Although the ssy was overcast during the whole afternoon, there was no rain, and with a gentle breeze rippling across the ocean from the south, the air was delightfully cool and invigorating. Bondi. — Notwithstanding the threatening state of the' weather yesterday, about 2000 pleasure seekers visited the spacious and beautiful grounds of the Bondi Aquarium. The pro prietary have gone to a considerable expense to promote the comfort of patrons, and are deserving the success they have attained. The company have notified their intenti011 °f making extensive alterations to the pleasure grounds, ' wMch are to be increased to double the present size^ and a large club and swimming baths are to be erected adjacent to the grounds. The management are also negotiating with a well-kno'prn- Queensland showman with a view of obtaining a startling attraction wMch is in store for«fch.e public. Yesterday the thousand and one attractions were extensively patronised, the principal of which was the shark pond, and late in the afternoon the public were startled with the fact that two large sharks, about 10ft* in length, had been captured off the rocks. These man-eaters caused much merriment when placed with others in the pond. During the after noon a grand sacred and. classical concert was held in the spacious hall, in wh'ich Misses J. Phillips .. and L. Roberts, and Messrs. W. B. Cadzow and Fred. England took part, under the direction of Mr. E. G. Wilson. The switchback railway, on the lofty, fragile structure, was con veying passengers from cliff to cliff all the after noon. '' With a iuanager ? like the genial and popular Monty Browne, the public will never regret paying a visit to the Royal Aquarium. Miss T.B. Chapman, the Irish lecturess, will deliver a lecture in the Protestant Hall this evening. The subject will be ' The Confessional,' -and judging from the manner in wliich her two previous lectures have Jbeen appreciated the house will doubtless be well filled. The sub ject of the last lecture announced for Wednesday next will be 'The 'Popes of Rome — Bow They Lived, Fought and Died.'
