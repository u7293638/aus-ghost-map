MY IiADY'S BliOTi . - ? '' ? OS, THE ' ? ? ' - Ghost of Diavolo Castle. i CHAPTER 111. HrBT«K68 AND MAID. . ' At. Lady Beattchamp's appearance in her Iwudoir, the black-ey«d maid -who had so. stealthily followed Nina, to the head of the stairs ] uttered a quiet ejaculation of relief. * I'm glad yea hare got back in such good time, Inez!' gie cried, excitedly, closing the door at vhich she had been long- stealthily on the -watch. ? * A-14? **«*«?* mmiaIt t XKTLiaA- IiakhmiAi) -ate 4-1% A library?' To that extraordinary address of her maid Lady Be&uchamp; at first returned no answer. Instead of an answer she administered an. im patient rebnke. 'Hnpbv Dolores!' she frowned. 'Ton epoak incautiously loud. Some day you -trill hare that sweet innocent proclaiming our true relations V *P6bh!' retorted the maid. 'I know when to cpeak, and irhen not to, Inez. The child's safe in your^ dressing-room.' S-he paused', smiled, an9 continued : * She's amusing herself with the crystal flasks in your perfume case — that is, suck ing the gold stoppers and washing her head with the costly extracts! That was the only way I. could keep 'her with her nurse. She w&s; born to be rich, Inez— she has sumptuous tastes. But ?what has happened?' Lady Beauchamp laughed softly at Dolores's account, and then pat a question on her own Bide. ' First thing, what happened upstairs to cause the scene down ?' ' fea told Nina — ' 'res, yes ; I know what she told her ; but how did it chance ?' ' On that point I am not fully informed. The little witch had slipped away from us, and I went to Nina's boudoir in search of her. Just as I lifted my hand to knock I heard Isa expa tiating upon the main clause in the new well i Half frightened to death, and not knowing how- - tauch she might have overheard, I hastily tapped, and brought her away. One glance at Nina's face- was sufficient to show me the words had cut deep and would result seriously. I therefore hurried to place Isa in the nurse's care, and set myself to watch the girl's movements. As I had antici pated, 'she. went down to- Sir Robert. Now; tell me how it has «nded. I saw her coming up. awhile fl.co. thfi nir.tnrp of «?eanair_ mid -umld easily imagine you had proved equal to the occa sion.* Lady Beauchamp's, wonderful eyes Sashed a proud glance of fiery significance ', upon the speaker. But before she could emphasise it by the words just trembling on her lips the patter of little .feet was heard in the dressing room beyond, and the next moment a fairy-like child came flying into the boudoir. ' Oh, mamma ? mamma !' she cried, springing into Lady Beanchamp's extended arms. ' I did hear your sweet voice ! I did ! I did !* * The proud, fiery exultation in my* lady's eyes 'melted as if by magic to a gaze of ineffable tenderness, lu & passion of love she pressed the tiny form to Lcr breast -and showered kiss -after ; kiss upon the dark, brilliant lace so like her own. Dolores broke in upon the proceeding. * lly lady,' she said, respectfully, * it is lun cheon time and your dress is still to change.' Lady Beauchamp laughed, pressod another hasty kiss upon the rosy mouth, and then, rising from the knee on which she had rested, led the child to the door. Fvniled fondly, ' and tell him mamma sent you to wake him happy till she can come herself. He is ia the library, pet.* Well pleased, the child patted off, and Lady l}-:auchainp closed the door and hurried with Dolores to her dressing-room. -She dismissed the nurse and then turned to Dolores. * Yfe&.' she smiled darkly, handing her hat and jpcrts tio the woEian^aiSd «taniin£'W^oWpY*i taeo to the point at which their conversation had bisn interrupted. ' Yes, I proved equal to the occasion. Have yon eter known me to be other^ wise. Dolores?' * Never!' responded the maid, -wjth prompt, admiring emphasis. 'Tour are worth a doz^a. of me, though we are sisters/ Lady Beauchamp laughed lightly, and. surreyed her beautiful face and petite form is the long mirror with evident satisfaction. * No one would suspect th6 relationship, Dolly/ sue said, after a moment. ? You ar» undeni.-tblv Spanish, but there is nothing of Lady Beauchamp about you.' L'olores accepted the uncomplimentary truth ?with serene good nature. * I should think not/' ehe said, shrugging her shoulders.
