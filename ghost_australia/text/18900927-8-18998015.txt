CULTIVATING MANGEL WUEZELS. Where ensilage ia used root crops are going out of the fashion, and it is well that it is so, for the great use for the root crop is principally to supply, after the green food season is over, succulent food of a watery nature to restore in a measure the lack of that clement in the form of dried grass which we name hay. Now cornstalk ensilage supplies this food in a far cheaper way, while its nutrient value is somewhat higher pound for pound. Though the weight of feed thut can be raised per acre is greater from mangel than from cornstalk, yet I doubt whether iu practice the weight of the former on an average exceeds that of the latter. In corn raising we do about all the work up to the gathering of the crop by machinery, whereas in the raising of mangels there is of neces- sity a good deal of finger work. Again, while corn- stalks are put in condition for the animal by a single process for the entire mass, in feeding mangels we must cut or pulp each individual lot. The home of root culture for stock feed is England, where the temperature does not admit of the raising of Indian corn. Low, rather moist, strong land will grow by far a greater crop of mangels than higher and lighter soil, but those grown on lighter soil will contain more sugar, and will therefore be more valuable for food, though this fact does not make it wi&e; to grow them on poor -upland clay soil ; but if it is friable, that is, of a crumbly nature, it will make excellent mangel soil. All lund needs deep plough- ing and eight cords of good manure to the acre ploughed in. Besides this 500 pounds of some good phosphate well mixed with the soil in the drill will pay as an investment. The drills should be as much as twenty-eight inches apart to admit the use of the cultivator, and whore land is cheap they had better bo thirty to thirty-six inches apart. If the land ia ridged we have smooth mangels, though I have not noted any increase in bulk. The ovoid and globular varieties are the sorts I noted growing in England and France. These have less waste about them than the long sorts, but in average eultivation do not yield BO much bulk. Seed should be used very liberally, eight to ten pounds to the acre, as the best of seed will not all germinate, owing perhaps to the want of sufficient moisture to saturate the spongy covering, which is necessary to enable the little seed hidden within to 6prout. I never saw poorer stands of mangels than in France, where farmers having had but a few acreB under cultivation may be assumed to have taken all pre- cautions to insure a crop. Sow tli9 seed as much as an inch and a half be- low the surface in soil that has been thoroughly worked, and in none other should it be planted. Thin to a dißtance which has relations to the quantity of manure applied ; with very high manuring fifteen inches is a limit, for average manuring half that distance. Mangles come the nearest to rhubarb in the rankneBs of the manure they will devour. I have raised heavy crops on soil so heavily fed with the refuse salted porgies that the straw of the oat crop which followed them was as salt as if it had been pickled. Pull them before the occurrences of frosts to any degree severe, otherwise we lose the feeding value of the leaves which are worth for weight nearly as much ns the roots themselves and a freeze that catches the exposed tops will cause them to turn dark and surely rot. After they are harvested allow the earth adhering to them to dry before storing, when it will mostly drop oil while loading into carts. The mangel is very easily kept. Frosts and rats are its chief enemies. If to go in a root cellar put them in at any convenient depth and throw a covering of waste hay over them. If to be kept in the ground dig a pit where rats do not abound in a dry spot two or three feet deep, fill to six inches above the surface, then throw on a little dry bniBh, then a layer of earth and cover this with bedding .stuff, adding a few rails or saplings to prevent blowing away. Carrots would surely heat up and rot if pitted half as deep. Mangels undergo some change in their nature so that they are not in con- dition to be fed before midwinter. If fed earlier they are apt to purge the cows. Like ensilage they are deficient in albuminoids and need to be supple- mented by some food rich in the absent element, .for the sake -of the cow, the milk pail, and the manure heap, euch as cottonseed, gluten meal, or Unseed meal Before the time for feeding mangels the cows can use the carrots, turnips, and cabbages A novel method of striking rose cuttings ia said to be much in use with European growers A ten inch cutting IB bent in the form of a bow and both ends inserted into the earth, so that only a part of the centre with the bud is above the ground This arrangement stops the evaporation from the top end while the lower end is forming roots All small fruitB require a complete fertilizer, either stable manure or a, chemical compound, on oil soils To keep a tree from growing too late in the autumn pinch off the terminal shoots as far as they can be reached If farmers will pick up all the loose bones, and boots, Ac , around the place and burn them, putting the asheB after being pulverized around their small fruits, it -will be greatly to their advantage The best remedy I have tried for apple tree pests is as follows -Soft soap, one pint, carbolic acid, four teaspoonfuls and water, hot or «old, to make four quarts This is also good for lice on cattle It works like a charm Do not despise a flower because it is old fashioned Some of the most meritorious flowers that we have arc thoBO that our grandmothers cultivated They may not have high sounding names, but they are away up in good qualities We cannot too often repeat +o enquirers aft« the best cow food, says the Jersey Bulletin, that no one food known will either bring or keep a cow up to her best work in butter making Short, fine, nutritious grass is as good or better than any other one thing, but the best of grass needs to be re- inforced by more or less of gram So the very best conceivable ration of grain needs to be rein- forced by grass or some other succulent food such as good corn silage The fertilizer chiefly needed for grape vines is potash Othi r manures may make a stronger growth of leaf and wood, but potash is needed in perfecting the fruit Fiench and other European vine growers fertilize thair vineyards by ploughing under the prunings This, if the soil is heavy, helps to keep the land light and porous while the green wood speedily decays and returns to the soil whatever potash it had abstracted But if the land Le sandy this return is not enough More potash must be applied 01 the fruit will suttor and the vine itself will have its vitality weakened In the Philadelphia gardens there are at present several rare and beautiful plants in bloom, notably " the Holy Ghost plant" and some tropical plants The Holy Ghost or dove plant blossom is so called from the flower having the appearance of a dove with expanded wings ho»enng over the stalk The flowers are white and open from the end of % long, green stalk They ore very flagrant and beautiful A geneial rule in popular gardening in regard to distances apart for various flowering and ornamen- tal plants is buefly summed up as follows - Panmes, dahlias, hardy sunflowers, and other strong growing plants, from three to four feet, asters, balsams, petunias, lilies, &c; , one to three feet, the generality of annuals, six inches to two feet Polled Angus or Aberdeen are a hardier breed than the Shorthorn says the Farming World In many places where thuy are bred m Aberdeenshire the soil is rocky and barren, but the stock owners there are pre eminent for their skill in the breeding and fattening of cattle which may account in a greai measure for the high quality of the stock raised on such land A still hardier breed is the Polled Galloway, bred m the south west of Scot- land.
