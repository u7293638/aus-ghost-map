A GHOST STORY FROM SOUTHPORT. A curious story is told by a correspon dent of/the "Liverpool Post" of a haunted house at Southport. It was occupied by an independent lady possessed of a deci dedly masculine type of mind and iron nerve. While occupied one forenoon at her writing-desk, this lady, having, according to her own story, a feeling that someone was present in the room, looked up, and saw standing at the other side of the desk the figure of a woman, who was gazing in tently at her. The figure had its head covered with a dark-colored mantle, though the features were distinctly shown. The lady, not believing in ghosts, and con vinced that she was under an hallucination, put out her hand to touch the apparition. She, of course, touched nothing â–  but air. The figure, however, remained for some minutes, and then retreated towards the door, and vanished. This experience was repeated on at least three occasions, and the lady kept it a secret for fear of creating alarm. However, one day, again in the forenoon, a piercing shriek was heard from the kitchen, and one of the ser vants was there found lying, in a fit. She averred that an exactly similar apparition had' passed through the kitchen a few minutes before. The apparition was seen once afterwards by a third person, but did not subsequently recur.
