PAGAN SUPERSTITION. I (To the Biliior of the Maitland Mercury.) ] Sin,-Can you or nr.y oí your numerous readers inform rae why the preucher in St. Paul's Church last Sunday, whilst in the pulpit, and as an introduction to his sermon, deliberately turned his back to the people and his faco towards the communion table ; and after sundry bowings crossed himself from bin head downward» nnd from Bh¿ul>lcr to shoul- der, repeating the following formula-In the name of the Father, -md of tlw Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. In Babylonian paganism, in Egyptian pnganisra, and" in the baptised paganism ot the early church, wo find this ceremony adopted tor purposes of rank superstition, ia, to warn off evil spirits. In Tertullian's time the sign of the cross had become a perpetually repeated and almost unmeaning ceremony in the Christian family life. On getting up or going to bed, on putting on their clothes or their shoes, on walking out or Bitting down, at table or at .the bath-in short, in every actor movement, j they made the sign of the cross upon the fore head. Chryaostom, in one of his homiies, assures his hearers that this sign, devoutly made upon the face, is most efficacious in private use for driving away unclean spirits, no one of which will dare to come near when it sees this weapon of Christ's victory. Surely the Rer. Mr. Duncan could not have been afraid of evil spirits when he stood up in the pulpit to preach the Gospel message ! In conclusion, it might not be out of place to ask the churchwardens (I will not name them this time), is it to them, or to the Rev. T. D. Warner, or to the Rev. Canon Selwyn, that the people of St. Paul's are indebted for the advent of this mediraval piece of church fur- niture, and for the introduction into St. I faurs Uhurch ot symbolic paganism ? -I am, I Sir, yours very truly, ONE OF THE CONGREGATION. West Maitland, Feb. 21, 1889.
