A DELIREOU8 PATIENT FOUND DROWNED. ? * ? The case which we reported yesterday, concerning the escape of a delirious patient from the Colonial Hospital, has had a fatal termination. Robert Daniels, a, steady young man aged about 20 years, formerly driver of a bakerfe cart for Mr. Chambers, had been treated in the hospital for ty phoid fever. He recovered on tbe first occasion and returned to bis home in Water-street. Perth, but having a relapse within a few days he was taken to the hospital again. He becaiae delirious, though he had lucid in tervals ; and about four o'clock on Friday morning, while the only nurse in charge uf the ward was absent foi a few moments. Daniels went oat of the building, covered only with his night-shirt, and climbing the railing he made his way to the river at the Causeway Bridge. There is no evidence at present that he was seen on the way, and if he had been seen at that time of the morning, just before day break, he might have been regarded as a ghost. The police have dragged tbe river near the bridge, and a' out eleven o'clock tbis forenoon they found the feoiy in the. river. An inquest was opened by the Coroner this afternoon, at the Central Police Station, and the jury having viewed the body, the taking of evidence was ad journed. ? A meeting of those interested in the formation of a short-hand class, in con nection with the Young Men's Christian Association, was held at the Society's Kooms, Hay- street, last evening, when Mr. Burgess a visitor from the Eastern Colonies, delivered a most interesting leefcurette on '* Pitman's phonography.' There was a, good attendance and the greatest interest vas evinced. After the lecture the secretary received the names of those desirous of joining the classes which are to be held weekly and which will be conducted by Mr. iJevilaqua.
