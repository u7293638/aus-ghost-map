Bat as Shakespeare has it— * What in tbia officer is but. a choleric word, is in tbe soldier rank blasphemy and in those days it was no uncommon thing for a 'gentleman * ((iod save the mark) to drink himself under -tha table. The old saying that example goes further than precept does not seem to have been thought of by tbo^e in -aothorityrin-the-liitle -settlementr However, it was not »U beer and skittles with tbe convicts.. They were, aroneed from their .Bluflabefs at sanrise and immediately set to work "at their several tasks, which they were kept at till seven in tbe evening, with abont two hours aud a half of intervals for rest and refreshment. But in extenuation of the hard labor, the discipline' to which they bad to submit was not very severe when we take into consideration all surrounding circumstances ; and their food was good, and there appears to have been plenty of it, in fact, the convicts in this respect fared quite as well as their keepers. ..y - Butithi&eKfees;^ive heat constantly re ferred to~ .and complained of., by the Be^i^pbe^t Knopwood, made continuous work^i-ksofiie to men irho had been enjoying or endnring a forced idleness cn shipboard for so .many months. To escape from this toncongenial toil, many convicts eluded the vigilance t»f their guards, and took to the bnsh. But they foand out that by doing so they had jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire. Tbe surrounding country was so "barren that absconders were-soon compelled to return. Yet notwithstanding the non-succesaof these, hardly a day passed without one or more of the others running away ; the object, of most of them being to reach-Port Jackson. A very hazy idea of the geography of their position prevailed among the convicts, it being generally imagined that the older colony was butja short distance off. To coriect this mistaken notion and lessen the number of" escapes, the Governor printed notices warning, all of tbe difficulties and' dangers of each a desperate eourse, and the utter impossibility of men, almostnaked and totally inexperienced in bush cratt, being successful in - an attempts to reach a settlement 1000 miles away along tbe coaBt j and adding, ^that ever should tbey by any chance elude the lynx-eyed and blood-thirsty natives, they would b9 immediately brought to justice and severely punished on their arrival at their destination In the month of November a batch of six convicts absconded, but in a' few days returned in a very sony plight, repentabt and crestfallen. On this occasion the Governor determined to make a striking example of the culprits, and teach a solemn leBSon to every convict in the encampment. He therefore ordered a general parade of troops and prisoners, and gave, instruction to the chaplain to read" his official commission as Lieutenant-Governor. After this ceremony he sentenced. each of the miserable delinquents -to it public caatigation of Jasb&eacb.; t 0 But this^brft&l; punSbmebt acted np: deterrent to their companions in durance, Jorifcis spotted that £ven so early as. the next day-^ome others made bold dash for lifwi^.^Thrai of these came back' inj sucll an e^hiau^ted state that the pnoishment^at cbqld not safely be administered to them.

Unfortunately for tbe fagitives, these piquets were on the qui vive and opened fire just as the retreating men began to feel that they had completely eluded tbe vigilance af their guards, with the result tbat one man was bought down by a well aimed bullet. " Another one was so terrified aud dased at seeing bis comrade fall tbat he paused in hi) flight and was immediate surrounded and captured. t Shot after shot reverberated through the woods, but none of tbe other runaways were hit. Dodging-behind trees and bushes and any inequalities of the ground that they could take., advantage of, they gradually got out of range and made good their escape. We will, now leave them for a time and follow the fortunes of the settlement. The success of this daring outbreak greatly alarmed the authorities, who considered that so large a number of the exiles being free in the bnsh was * a strong meuace to the maintenance of order within the boundaries - of the settlement. It was feared that others would strive to emulate the enterprise of Buckley and his party. The night watch was immediately strengthened, and shortly afterwards voluntary association cf c-ivii officers and free settlers was formed to assist the military in their police functions. The officers of this kindof special constabulary carried firearms and the men were armed with batons. Their self-appointed duties consisted of a patrol of the en campment independently of the military rounds. Being irregular in their move ments, and not wearing a uniform like the soldiers it could never be foretold by the convicts when or where they would turn up next, and consequently tbey soon became Tery useful in ^heckibg crime; and many an unfortunate misdemeanant waB pounced upon by them and promptly brought to j dstice; In consequence of " large fires being seoi at some distance from the encampment it was concluded tbat tbe escapees were still in the neighbourhood, It was therefore determined that an effort should be made to retake them. With this object an expedition was organised oa the 6th of January, 1804, in which the 1 civil association and eeveral marines. joined their forces. .. They managed' to follow the tracks' "of' tHe fugitives for several miles," but could trace them no further, and perforce had to come back unsuccessful. No. otber attempt was made in this direction as the Governor thought that it was unneces- sarily harrasing to the small force under his command,-and he felt sfrre that, the runaways would retnfn or else perish ~ by starvation.
