Marv Ann. who was general -servant .to' Mrs. McGuppin who lived close-by, and let lodgings, rushed in, pale as a ghost and exclaiming : ; ' "Oh, 'Tilda 1". . " My goodness, what is the matter ? " ..cried Mrs.- Pringle ; has Mrs. McGuppin been taken with a fit ?". " Oh, worse, 'Tilda ! ".gasped Mary Ann. "I was, in the house all.alone with 'ein . VYith . '.'em !— with who ? " . . . ; " ThieTodgers.; Oh, 'Tilda ! — she so handsome,; andj lie appearih' to dote on the very flagstones shealked5. upon ! I don't know how' I've found my way across the street, I'm in that tremble ! " " Here, drink this cup oLliot" 'tea 'j -'th'at?ll " compose .you.":.'.. " ' ' Ohj 'Tilda ! after what > -I've heard, I shall .never be composed any more. " "; ' . ; - m \ , " Don't go on talking like that, " and looking as if you expected to see spectres coming through the parlor, door ! What have you seen ? what have you heard ?" 'Oh, 'Tilda ! Mrs. McGuppin was gone out, and. I was coming down stairs past their door— the drawin' room— when I heard 'enr struggling '= So I; put my; 'ear to the panel of the door, and— oh, 'Tilda ! " " For mercy's sake, Mary Ann, don't roll your eyes ;in 'that ;way ; but finish .the tea, and then tell me ' what you heard. " > , . . , " I wiU, 'Tilda. Well, the first thing I heard him say ivas, '.You have been faithless I. have,' she says— and she so innocent-looking, 'Tilda ! " . -., : , " Go ou. What-did lie say, then ? " ' ' " Of course I can't tell you in the exact words lie lised, but they was something like this : " Aha ! the mask have at last fallen from your, perjured brow ! You have never lov'd me, but your false heart have always been another's - the Count of Gaddybaldc' — or some such name, I couldn't clearly catch it"; he spoke so between his clenched teeth, like a serpent. " " Good gracious ! and'then what did she say ? " : ' '. She said, 1 1. am . guilty ; . he lured me, ' she said, ' I tried; to love. you, as was my duty. . I fled from him, but he crossed fny path, and I could not x'esist His facshinations ! 'Have mercy on me !", 'No,' He says. ' I M'ill be a faithful wife to you in future,' she says, f No ! ' lie says, ' never again,' lie says, shall your perfidirous falseness twine itself like the some thing ivy round my wither'd heart ! ' ' Mercy ! ' she says again, almost in a shriek. ' No !" he says, 'not for you in. this, world, lie T says. .'I liaye taken the life of you'r parrymourjahd ! now ifc vis your" turn 'to- die ! ' lie says. Oh, 'Tilda ! .'when. I heard him say those dreadful words, I made sure , I should have fallen on the landing — and' I in the house all alone with 'em ! " . ; ; " Don't give way, Mary Ann. Have some more hot tea. - My goodness ! What else did you hear ? " y '; " ' Spar.e me. : for our' child's sake ! ' she says. Aha ! ". he says, in the -voice of a demon ; ' that lias sealed .your doom ! ' Then he seemed to seize her and drag her about .the room, she all the while . crying out for mercy, and ' he yelling - at her that the more she-appealed for mercy, the more his. wither'd heart was closed against, lier." > - ' ' ' "Bless my .soul— how shocking !-" . cried- Mrs. Pringle. Well, what next ? " - " Then-roh,f. 'Tilflii ! , If I_ hadn't been that sick and faint that I had .no' voice to use, I should have screamed ; ' murder !.' for that's wliat was goiiig on, on the other side of' that drawing- room door." " Murder, Mary Ann ! in Mrs.: McGuppin's draw ing-room !", ' ' " Murder, 'Tilda ! and it's been done ! and. me only oil the landing .outside ! " "-Mercy- upon us ! Are you . sure ?< -How do you. know?" - - - ' - " Oh, I heard him only too plainly, say to his poor wife,' '.No more ! you die ! This knife,' on which the, stains of his heart's black blood is still visiblej shall ' drink -yours ! '. Then she shroke — fell upon the floor, and .said with her last, 7br eath— poor . young thing, 'Gustave, I forgive you my death, which I have deserved, and which I hope will be a warning to all young wives not to listen .to the, soft, speeches of fashionable seducers from the paths- of -virtue. ' . And ; then she seemed to die without being, able to say - a word more." " This is all very dreadful, Mary Ann," said Mi's. Pringle, by this time nearly as white in the face as Mary Ann herself. " And did you hear him say any thing after that ? " . .' ' ' Oh, 'Tilda ! you'll hardly credit it, but the, only remark he made was this, "All right, old girl; that; will do very well, I: think. ' " " The cold-blooded monster ! " , " That is exactly what I said to myself, 'Tilda, as I' rushed downstairs arid out of „ the house, for fear that, after slaughtering his pretty young wife,, he might come out of .tlie room, and; finding that his crime was known— his very words over heard,, he might have thought, that the only way of saving himself .-.was .to - murder me J - - "I really- don't know what yon ought do,:. Mary Ann. Poor Mrs... McGuppin !. it will be a , dreadful shock-to her. I wish William was at home; but he won't Coirie off duty for the next two liours, and, by that time, the monster will have made ; his escape." .What name; did1 they go by ?" . ' ;. . . " Mr. and Mrs.. Fitzaltamont." '.' Eitz — what ?" . cried . Mrs... -Pringle,. . upsetting- the remains of her, first cup of tea. V Fitz— what,?" " Altamont,". repeated Mary Ann, " They had 'only;5 come into the lodgings the day before." "You ha ve given me a turn, you foolish girl 1" cried Mrs. Pringle, somewhat hysterically. : "-.What do you meau, 'Tilda ?" ., " Why, that "Mr. , and Mrs. Fitzaltamont 'are the actors that are going to perforin to-night at the Theatre Royal. Their names— in big , letters— are oh all the walls 'about the town." , ; f' Actors?" cried Mary Ann, vacuously. ; " Of course ! and they were, no doubt, going through their'" part's, to see whether .they -knew Jem perfectly . before night. " i ; - >, i " Actors !— acting !"- murmured Mary Ann, : as if in a dream, as -she hurried back to her- mistresses .house. " Well, if they call that nobing, I can only say it was as'like the real tiring as I'hope never to overhear again » ; . \ ill y/oy AXJLV" V . . ' , . j „ C. S. Cheltnam. i-
