THE DAMPIER COMPANY, By producing "Hamlet" at the Town Hall to-night, Mr. Alfred Dampier opens up the old question as to the sanity of the Prince of Denmark. Our own opinion is that he is not really mad, but that he is masquerading as a lunatic the better to achieve what, after his interview with his father's ghost, became the purpose of his life. Hamlet in his soliloquies, when nothing, is to be gained by playing a madman's part, is invariably sane. He is sane when addressing a person on whose fidelity he can rely, such as his best friend Horatio, who, in truth, is the finest gentleman in Shakespeare. Indeed, he tells Horatio of his intention to "put on an antic disposition," and, in consequence, whatever vagaries Hamlet may commit Horatio never ceases to regard him as sane. He is saneness itself in the famous scene with his mother, when he implores her to divorce herself from his uncle. To- night's produc tion will be splendidly staged and cast, so that a rich intellectual treat is in store for the public.
