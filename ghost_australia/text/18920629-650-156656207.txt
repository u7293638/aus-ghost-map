His Female Guards. The king of Dahomey's Amazons, who are now executing a ghost-dance, as it were, against the French, are made up of three classes of women â€” stout maidens who arc selected by /the king, unfaithful wives who are sent into service instead of being executed, and wives who are so vixenish that their husbands cannot endure them. There are two thousand five hundred of these female soldiers, and everything possible is done to inspire them with cruelty. The strictest celibacy is enjoined upon them, and any departure from it is punishable by death.
