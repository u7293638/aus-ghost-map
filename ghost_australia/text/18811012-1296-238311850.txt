AMUSEMENTS. The Theatre Roynl was very largely attended last night, and the opera " La Fille du Tambour Major "' was performed entirely to the satisfaction of tho nndienee. Miss Lavcrne's sprightly vivacity exercises tno most inspiriting lnuucnce, anil the capital acting of Mr. Mcrvin, together with the bnmourons performances of Messrs. Harwood and Wallace, form a most attractive entertainment. The same programme will be repeated this evening, " Mother-in-Law" and the mirth-provoking bur lesque " The Corsican Brothers," constitute what is certain to become n very popular entertainment nt the Gaiety Theatre. The first-named is a farcical comedy bristling with very funny incidents, anil written in a bright and amusing style. Moreover, it is capitally playeJ, every one of those engaged in its representation doing his or her utmost to attain success. The bnrlcsqno is similarly laugh able, and both pieces deserve to remain tbo attrac tion at this house for some time to come. Mr. W. J.
