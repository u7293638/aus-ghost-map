WITS THE CnANSSL SQUAD SON. IN THE BALTIC. BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE MAINTOP STARBOARD It's astonishing how soon one becomes accustomed to having little to do When first I joined H M S Collapse I felt myself somewhat out of it. I was a junior KN it, among CO full blown naval officers, 1 knew no one save another lonely li N It man from the P and O service, and for the first ten days I was on board I neither received nor gave an order I came to the conclusion that, though Her Majesty was most graciously pleased to receive It N R. volunteers, she had not much for them to do when she got them I looked back longingly on the jolly days of the manoeuvres and the ward room of H.M.S. Boomer, and then, just as I was beginning to think regretfully of the old "Britisher," I discovered I had made new friends, and was very happy indeed in the gunroom of H M S Co'lnpae By the time we received our sailing orders I was perfectly reconciled, and was quite ready to be entertained by as many crowned heads as chose to do so, for we were bound for the land of the Dane, and Copenhagen and Kiel were our destination We left Spithead on the 23th September, and had a perfectly smooth passage across Nothing occurred to break the monotony, and the usual routine of a man of war went on with clockwork like recusant) It takes a good deal though to break in on that regularity. 1 begin to doubt if it could be done However, this time our voyage was not very long, for on the 30th we had arrived at Lismore, and anchored close to " Hamlet's Castle " But the ghost was not on view Maybe he thought it wouldn't be healthy so close under the guns of four line of battle ships, and next day we proceeded up to Copenhagen, and lay there four days It is a splendid antique buildings, beautiful squares, and every now and again young lakes in said squares, which greatly added to their charm. But it is not only the city that is delightful The girls are, I should think, the very prettiest on the face of the earth Dark eyes, pink and white complexions, and fair hair (which is the rifle range up a very charming combination, and has a great many speak English we were right in it " Women and dogs only go together in a certain very ungallant couplet, of which I, as a sailor man, do not think for a moment when I mention that they seem to have a splendid breed of dogs here, nearly every one you meet being almost as big as a young pony. On the 4th we returned to our old anchorage at Elsmore, and the King and Queen of Denmark, the Czar of Russia, the Prince and Princess of Wales, Princes Albert and George, two Princesses, and troops of smaller Princes whose tally one is apt to forget, came off and lunched with the Admiral and looked over the ship Reflected Glory M) servant danced the hornpipe before them That night we went up in a special train to a ball given at the Hotel d'Angleterre in our honour We found shortly after starting that our tram was running pilot to the dar'., who was coming up from Friedcnaborg. I felt it slightly exciting, as if any Nihilists had happened to lay a mine for His Imperial Majesty we should certainly have had the benefit of it. The ballroom was very pretty with English, Danish, and Russian uniforms. The first dance was a wait, and just as I was sailing into the room a lieutenant whom I knew said "You were pretty fairly, don't you'' I said, "Oh, yes " "Then don't try here, or you will never be able to dance decently again , besides, you'll be too much damaged " I went and had a look, and certainly I never saw such a sight in my life- stampede doesn't express the wild career of those people. Anyhow, I concluded to try my luck, and carefully selected a delicate looking girl, who I thought couldn't hurt me much, and cleared for action. In two seconds I hadn't enough breath left in me to raise a smile, and was bruised from head to foot I quickly found one was not expected to waltz, everyone galloped to it, and they didn't mind falling in the least After I had picked myself up a bit I met my friend again " Hallo, how do you feel now ' " Oh, so so, but my mistake was in not getting hold of a large damsel, I should have had a better chance " Accordingly I got hold of a baroness weighing about 14 stone, GIL high, and shoulders like a hussar, Alas, we were most successful as far as clearing the gangway was concerned, but she had daubed paint all over her arms, and my coat (unpaid for too was in a fearful mess, and before she had done she had also torn on) my starboard scale (also unpaid for) and generally damaged toe 'Then I stood aside and made a resolve never again-no, never again, and I kept it till they danced a position, in which I had for my partner a Minister's daughter of sorts, nationality) unknown The dance was pretty, and so was she but she could t speak a word of English, and in the carillon the girls have it all their own way About half-past 2am half a dozen of us, feeling the dissipation was getting too much, retired from the gay and festive scene, and made a tour of the cafes of the town We stopped that night at the Hotel d'Angleterre, and came back to the ship next evening just in time to catch our ship, as there and then we sailed for Kiel at a moment's notice, a gunboat remaining behind to bring in stray officers flint night we anchored in mid ocean in 16 fathoms, and by the aid of the electric light the gunboat picked us up , but even now I believe three or four British officers are at large in Denmark 'The water is wonderfully) shallow in this part of the world We had to come round the north of the island as there wasn't enough water the other way line (he iatliouiH out of sight of land, and we draw a quarter less five It is bitter cold coming off watch Spite of all wraps I get more than three parts frozen at night, and nothing seems to warm me up again We made acquaintance with several nationalities in Denmark Germans, Danes, and Russians principally, and we improved our friendship at Kiel The Russians are fine looking fellows, solemn, dignified, and stately, and were much decorated with stars and orders, but then, of course, I only saw them on great occasions, when they might be supposed to have their best bags on They are, however, very silent, don't dance, but stand all t gether in one corner, and the prettiest girls in the room seemed to have no charms for them The C/ it himself is one of the finest men I have ever seen. We were made a good deal of, and in fact ran the show in several places, and once only was there a probability of trouble There were three lieutenants, two marines, and myself standing together when a Johnnie interposed with "Ah I see English Dey arc mad, but good tempered day are rich I'm sure I wish I was-" hut they are all mad dese sailors " Of course I laughed Then the other red lows laughed, and presently everybody was making so nearly ended in Btnnke, Uli, mein heber Copenhagen, why did we ever leave you'' Kiel isn't a patch on you. We entered the narrow retary that Kiel is at the top of on a beautiful morning., the Mh of October It is a yen pretty harbour, and the blues looked free steaming slowly past the forts Every point was crowded with people, and the amount of time we saluted and played " The Watch on the Rhine," ' God Save the Queen, and "God Save the Kaiser ' were legion As this place is very hilly, our salutes sound no end, and occasionally astray gun or two will turn up even now, six days later, out of some valley or another. The Emperor of Germany came in his launch, but without his standard, to see us make fast, and since then, about every four hours, we chip in with 31 guns as his flag is hauled up or down at the castle. Kiel has killed-I might have said Kiollcd, but 1 won't-the fatted calf for us with a vengeance Men of wars' boats attended to take our lines to the buoys, so that our tars shouldn't strain themselves, and crowds were always waiting to see the officers land; and though in private clothes, it is something awful the amount of salutes one has to return in an hour His Majesty came on board to lunch yesterday, and inspected the ship. He seemed a very good fellow, although the only conversation I had with him was 4ft 6in, sir," when he asked me the length of the torpedo in the tube I had charge of, and I got hot immediately, wandering what tally I ought to have fetched out instead of Sir On the 9th October the German naval officers entertained us at a smoking concert, at which the Emperor presided The dress was frock coats and swords We sat down at 0 To solemnly smoke and drink beer with an occasional remark No singing, and nothing Lochleven the proceedings at least to my mind, for I'm not Inch fouled and don't understand orchestral music At 11 the Emperor left for Berlin, the admirals and other dignitaries leaving for their ships, the highest rank present then being commanders "In the game that ensued I did not take a hand," at least that is only a very small one, but the sight of that room next morning must have been worth seeing. Wreckage, ye gods We were strangers and we took them in. I have assisted at some corroborees, but that took the cake Suffice to say, that at 2 a in eight naval officers started to find If M S Collapses At 8 p va she had been at anchor at a buoy in the harbour, but an idea seemed to prevail that she was somewhere inland, and the whole crowd started to find her a Britisher between two Germans I don't know what part of the Empire we travelled over, but at 4 am about twenty four naval officers of both nations standing on a pier-locality in known-with drawn swords, solemnly swore to love one another, fight anybody) and every- body shoulder to shoulder, and to do their little best to marry Queen Victoria to the Emperor William I believe the latter has a wife and family ahead), and feel very sorry for them in tins trying situation. Nearly every German naval officer speaks English, so our conversation was not limited. They had a very pretty idea of lighting the road from our boats to the not-tars dressed in white holding lanterns, but very trying after a tea fight ! The sun There is very powerful, at least something has great effect on British bends, for after we came off I saw a sHall) quiet shipmate trying to kiss the sentry in a dark corner on the half deck, That sentry was an Irishman and co) As we had some time to stay here a friend and I got leave and went up to Hamburg for a day, and thoroughly did the old free city. It is a splendid town, well worth seeing, fine buildings, line pictures, and all the rest of it, but, oh ! the ladies, after Copenhagen's pretty girls, I don't like to be ungallant, but to put similar), they were plain And the trams aren't up to much, 100 kilometres in three hours and 30 minutes During our absence the English were enter tained at a big dance, and the naval officers rolled up, as usual, in great force, but alas ! the Germans didn't play the game, every girl's programme was full before they got there, and before supper the hosts trotted down and jammed their own cards in all the places, consequently the Britishers left at a very early hour, vowing solemnly never again to go to a German ball It was probably a mistake, because everywhere we have been found, but as the German damsels are not quite so tempting as the fair Danes, we managed to survive Kiel itself is really the dullest place on record , the streets are empty, and no business appears to go on at all Creswick, Daylesford, and other up-country towns 1 won of in my native land come before my mind's eye as busy marts and centres of commerce when I compare them with Kiel It is strictly) " mainstay," and, as I soon discovered, anybody speaking at all loud in the streets after 10 will have an old watchman with a long pole after him in no time From Kiel we sailed for Sweden, and our next stopping place was Carlscrona frankly, I don't think much of Carlscrona I have read somewhere that the population of Sweden is mostly rural, and I don't wonder if all the towns are like this It is a dismal spot nothing but scrub and big boulders of granite Still the people treated us right royally, and the crowd to see the officers land was always about 16 deep The day after we arrived was "coal ship," pea paper chase was started and a mess mate and I voted hares. We threw off at half-past 11 a in with 10 minutes' start, and had a splendid run through very rough country. The climbing was something awful At 1 o'clock we were crossing from one wood to another, when, as we were half way across we saw the only six rounds left in it close on us, and, to our dismay, a river deep and strong, it not very wide, flowed right in front There was nothing for it, so, although we were done to a turn, in we went, and a river in Sweden in October is-to put it mildly chill). We got across, and into the wood, but swimming all standing with bags full of paper when one is tired is a pretty long job The hounds luckily funked it, and searched for and found a bridge about a mile down, but as we had a good start we arrived in Carlscrona about 3 o'clock, half an hour ahead of them that evening, at the Swedish admiral's ball, I was introduced to a pretty girl, who burst out laughing in my face, and then apologised in the prettiest broken English, Berlin"' that if I had only seen myself that afternoon-I started in spotless white mud and green moss from head to foot, hatless, and with one wheel off my boot, I would have laughed too She also told me the papers praised "ye hardy Anglais that did swim , " but of course we missed the account, as it was in Swedish, and I don't know that any of the Collapse s officers understand that tongue. At that ball, ton, I was talking to a Swedish commodore, and after he had gone another Swede came up and asked me if I knew who that was said, "No,' and he then told me it was Prince Oscar, who threw away his chance of reigning to marry Miss Monck. I had no idea of the dignity of the gentleman I had "happened across," or, perhaps, I should have been slightly discom posed at the idea of carrying on a conversation with so exalted a personage As it was I was quite at my ease and he chatted away pleasantly like any common or garden sailor On our passage home I see the papers say we had a gale, but I believe it was only the usual North Sea weather, which couldn't behind, e itself even for the Channel Squadron. We certainly had one nasty thunderstorm, but it didn't amount to much, and only served to remind me of a fine jam I heard sometime ago, of which the hero was a certain eccle Biaatical dignitary well known on your shores The dignitary in question, who is a very grave and learned gentleman indeed, found occasion to revisit the old country, and, according, took his passage by the RMS. D One night there was a dirty thunder squall, and next morning at the breakfast table in the saloon passengers and officers discussed it as folks will at sea, where anything to break the monotony is a godsend. Captain {foq )-" That was a nasty squall last night Ecclesiastical Dignitary "Yes, but we are safely through it, thanks to Providence " Captain, who felt that was hardly fair. " And good navigation ' E D took no notice, but went on calmly "Just after it started there was a weight attached to a line hanging over the ship's side As it kept banging 1 pulled it in and put it under my pillow ' Captain "Great Scott, sir, if we had been struck by lightning there would have been only your gaiters lett." E D-'fWhj ' Captain (solemn!) ) -"That was the end of the lightning conductor ' Tableau Though the weather was rough we did our quarterly firing in spite of it, and arrived at Spithead again on the card October Again, I find I change my abode, for I am sent to tilly gunboat Mudlark, for watching keeping duties, as they have only three lieutenants If your hear of her taking the overland route, or practising running down some other craft, you can make a few dollars by betting who was on the bridge She is bound for Spain, Morocco, and other places in the Mediterranean, and if I have as good a time in the southern seas as I had in the northern I shall be more than satisfied,
