SIRS. JOSEPH CHAMMERLA IN'S GREAT ANCESTOR. Now tliis Governor Endicott, tile ancestor of Mrs. .loseph Chamberlain, «as tflio suc- cessor of AVinlhorp as Governor of Massa- chusetts in 1(144 and again in 1G4A. In 1(145 lie was appointed Kergonnt/Major Genernl, and in 1U52 'ho established a mint in the new colony winch, though without legal authority, continued to supply a cur- rency for more .chan thirty years. Bays tho local historian of Iloston, " Endicott opposed the crusade of the Kev. .lohn Cot-, ton against t'he wealing of veils by ladies, and had a wann personal discussion with I that eminent divine." Hts portrait is more like n Cardinal of Richelieu's time ithan a Puritan soldier. Some time ago thcro was running on thc American stage a diumaitic verson of the "The! Scarlet I/cttcr," of which I had the honour to bn flic author,' and Mr. Richard 'Mansfield took full ad- vantage, of the fine costumes that were worn by certain of thc Pilgrim Fathers in the first days of Massarfiiiaolts. Governor Endicott was an uncompromising Puritan. It was he who sent the obnoxious Episco- palians home to England, and afterwards cut the ero** from bhe King's standard be- cause/'it "savoured of Popery." What «wild thc illustrious ghosts of old New England say to f be prnsent position of thc Roman Catholic Church in the Massachu- setts of our day could they revisit the landmarks of their-earthly pilgrimage?
