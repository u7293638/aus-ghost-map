A NEW SONG, (As sung with great applause to the electors at Gayndyh , by the Chairman of the Bris- bane Philharmonic Society.) AIR â€” Wapping Old Stairs. Your Robert has never been false he declares, Since when last he addressed you on public affairs, When with cheers at his speeches you strained your free throats, And he plighted his vows, and you gave him your votes. Through the dreary debate for your sake he has dozed, And each call for more "tin" from the Downs has opposed; Has with patience endured the fine frenzy of RAFF, The loud thunder of WATTS, and the Courier's chaff. For a long time the Press gave your ROBERT no peace, On account of blacks killed by tho Native Police, Yet to save your pet force he exerted his tact, And the "killing no murder" committee was packed. When you growled, tried I not, say, to throw you a bone, And with HALY'S sweet accents I mingled my own, For two thousand I asked, but the House refused that, And with HALY alone on the benches I sat. When seduced by the Press, and that horrible man Who writes with the signature "Ghost of Ban Ban," You said I was false, and to Brisbane too kind, I never reproached you, but secretly pined. Though t'was cruel to doubt mo, you ne'er heard me sigh, You saw not the tear which I dashed from my eye. Then be constant and true, nor your ROBERT forsake, Still your bridges he'll build, and your roads too he'll make.
