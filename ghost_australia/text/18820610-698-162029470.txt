The Fast Season. No. 4. By Nemo. The Murrumbidgee Turf Club held its minimi meeting at Wagga on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of November, but the reunion was hardly so successful as usual, though some of the events were keenly contested. Cambric opened the ball by winning the Produce Stakes, five furlongs, from Loiterer, Treasure Trove, and seven others, including Lord Loftos, who was the favourite, in 1.4}, but though that time was very fast the winner has not distinguished herself since. Bryan O'Lynn gave us some idea of his quality by beating Gamecock and Johnny Crapaud over a mile, and then Martindale justified the betting, carrying 8st. to the front for the Wagga Cup, for which he was followed home by Secundus, 8st. 41b., and Bainbow, 6st., Dictator, 5at 71b., Lord Burghley, Set. 111b., and The Marchioness. 6st 91b., succeeded in order. The two 'miles were cast behind in 3.37. The Exeter had no difficulty in securing The Maiden Plato, 1 J mile, from Outlaw and Anglesey ; but had not Jessie bolted when at the front the result might have b6cn different. Outlaw could not have lost the Derby had he not swerved and parted with his rider, when four 'strides from the post, and Birthday came home alone. Jessie, ' 7st. 71b., Eva, 7st. 101b., and Anglesey, 7st. 121b., came home in order for the Two-year Old Handicap, i-mile, in 1.20: and the places for the Grand Stand Handicap, 1| mile, went to Gipsy Cooper, 8st., Honesty, 6st. 101b., and Nightmare, 7st. 71b., in 2.13. West Country Dick, 6st. 51b., Gonzago, 8st. 41b., and Dictator, 7st. 21b., came home as named for tie Flying Handicap, |-mile, in 1.18. The first race on the second day, the Mile Handicap, fell to Milbrodale, 7st/81b., and he was attended by West j Country Dick, 7st. 41b., and Eva, fist. 71b., and the trip was done in 1.46. Gretna Green, a more than promising I two-year-old, daughter of John Bull and Snownake, won. £he two-year-old Selling Plate ; and the Substitute Stakes went to Gipsy Cooper, 9st., who was seen home by Rainbow, 6st* 91b., and Milbrodale, 7st. 71b.; and the mile and a- half was run in 2.41§. .Young Deceiver won the Steeplechase ; andJGamecock, 8st. 101b., Honesty, 7st. 101b., and Jem Tyson, 6st. 71b., filled the places as named for the final flutter. The A. J. C. held its Summer Meeting on the 26th December, when the attendance was large, and the racing excellent. Jack, 9st., Pinto, lOst., and Wrangler, lOst. 31b., came home as named for the Hurdle Race ; and then Jessie made good her Wagga form by coming home before Clem en ce, Vanquish, Piracy, Mistake, and eight others, in the December Stakes, o furlongs, in 1.3 3-10. Tramp Yo&s;, 8st. 71b., just . got home before Valetta, 5st 101b., for the Summer Cup, 1£ mile ; and after the pair, at an interval of four lengths, came Bathurst, 8st 9lb. ; attended by Major, 7st., Queensberry, 6st. 51b., and Lord Orvile^ 6st» 41b. The other starters were Milbrodale, 6st. 121b., Templar, €st. 121b., Balthazar, 6et. 101b., Prima Donna, 6Bt. 101b., The Drummer, 6st. €lb.r Caimen, €st. 41b., Yosemite, 6st. 21b., and Rosi nante, 5ut 71b. ; and the race was the fastest on record in the colonies, viz., 2.37. After Jack, lOst. 71b., and Rain- ' bow, list. 41b., had run a dead heat for the Amateur Han dicap, 1J mile, with Ranger, IObL, third,, the former won the run-off by a head. Rosinante carried 7st. to the front for the Selling Plate, 1J mile, in 2.18 ; and King's Head, by Emperor from Kalo, 7st. 71b., Albert Victor, 7st. 101b., and The Witch, 7st.71b., came home as mentioned for the Two-year-old Plate, five furlongs, in 1.4. Brian Born, 7st. 91b., was most in favour for the A. J. C. Handicap, a mile and a furlong, but he failed to get up, and the places were occupied by Inverary, 5st 71b., Creswick, 9st., and Stella, 6st 61b., in 1.68. On the 31st of December we had the Sydney Turf Club Summer Meeting. As at the A. J. C. Meeting, Jack opened the ball by securing the Hurdle Race ; and then the public had another good tarn, for Aureola, by Angler from Chryso lite, who left the. paddock at 6 to 4, carried 6st. 81b. to the front for Ely Handicap, six furlongs. She was followed home by Falmouth, 8st. 101b., and The Drummer, 6st. 121b., and the trip was done in 1.16 &\- 10. Vanquish, 8st., Piracy, 8st. 31b., and Normanby, 7st., rattled home in order for the Sapling Stakes, 5 furlongs, in 1.3 4-10; and Stella, 7st. 41b., Gamecock, 6st. 31b., and Kelpie, 7st. 21b., occupied the places in Selling Plate, 7 furlongs, in 1.30 6-10. Tramp Yoss, 9st. 51b., was most in favour for the Turf Club Handicap, but brokedown when running well; andtheplaoes were filled by Saunterer, 8st. 21b., Queensberry, 6st. 71b., and Carmen, 6st. 101b., and the mile and three furlongs was run in 2.25 5.10. And so ended the year. On the 2nd of January we had the Tattersall's Club Annual Meeting ; and Wrangler had the honour of winning the first race of the yeai^ for, with lOst 31b. up, he won tha Hurdle Race after a brilliant race, with Jack. Jessie, Gamin, and Normanby came home as named for the Tattersall's Mares' Produce Stakes, four furlongs, in 50 5-10 seconds. Valetta was in most request for Tattersall's Cup, but, although she had only 5st.- 71b. in the saddle, she could only get third to Lord Orville (by Orville, by New Warrior) 6st. 21b., and Rosinante, 5st. 71b., Balthazar 6st. 61b., The Drummer 6st. 21b., and Brilliant 6st. 41b., attended the placed three; and the other starters were Bosworth, 8st. 71b. (who finished last), Woolstone, 7st. 101b., Prima Donna, 6st. 111b., Queensberry, 6st., and Whirlwind, 6st. ; and the time was 3.33 4-10. Major 7st., Stella 6st. 111b., and Brian Born, 6st. 131b., ran home in order for the Selling Race; one mile and a furlong, in 1.58 6-10. The Two- year-old Selling Plate, six furlongs, went to Belvidere, Cst. 111b. (a son of Maribymong and Illumination) ; and he was auenuea oy no Den me jjbvu, /sc. /id., ana luistage, 7st. 71b., in 1.17 4-10. Lord Orville must have been in great buckle, for, notwithstanding his effort in 'The Cup,' he saddled up, and won the New Year's Gift, 1£ mile, with 6st. 41b. up, in 2.12 5-10, beating Templar, 7st. 41b. ; Silver Arrow, 5st. 101b. ; and amongst the nine others that started were Master Avenal, 9st. ; Saunterer, 8st. 101b. ; and Queensberry, 7st. 21b. '? On the same day our Victorian neighbours had a lot of good racing, and a few surprises at Flemington, where the Normanby Stakes was secured by Navigator, and Corio lanus astonished everyone by settling the pretentions of Commotion, Wellington, Wheatear, Santa Claus, and Royal Maid in the Champion Stakes, when the three miles were run in 5.40. The V. R. C. Autumn Meeting next claimed attention on the 4th, 9th, and 11th of March, and on the first day Darebin suffered defeat from Commotion, by Panic from Evening Star, and Pell Mell in the St. Leger ; while on the second Sweet William, 6st. 131b., who was a red hot favourite for the Australian Cup, 2£ miles, could only get third to Pollio, by Tim' Whiffier (imp.) from Norma, 6st. 71b., and the gallant old Wellington, 8st. 121b., and the journey was run in 4 minutes \ second, the fastest time for the distance yet done in the colonies. The last day also produced a surprise, for Hesperian and The Ghost were heavily backed for . the Newmarket Handicap, but quite failed to get near the front, and the places were secured tyy Hyacinth, by Lord of Lione from Gray Esperance, 7st. 61b., Euclid, 7st. 91b., and Larpent, 8st. 61b., who had a host of friends^and the f-mile was run in l.l6|. Our HawkeBbuiy friends held their Autumn Meeting on the 30th of March and the 1st of April. Piracy, the fine raking daughter of Rapid Bay and Parisite, commenced prp-' ceedings by carrying 8st. to the front for the Short's Han dicap, f-mile, in 1.17, beating Paragraph, 7et. 91b., Polly John, 6st. 101b;, and a very useful field. Vaucluse, by Rapid Bav from Chrysolite, Ilecla, and Saionara came home* as named for .tie Maiden Plate, .1$ mile, in 2.15, and The Drummer, byTheDrummer from Minerva, j 6st. 61b., defeated Sweet William, 6st. 121b., for the Autumn Handicap, 1£ mile, 'by half-a-lengthin 2.38 8-10. Hawthornden, 5st. 101b.,, was at Sweet William's quarter, third, and three lengths from him came Barber, 8st. 31b., attended by Prima Donna, 6sfc 21b.; Carmen, 6st.~ 41b. ; Bathurst, 8st. 91b. ; Balthazar, 6st. 81b. ; and Rainbow, 6st.

Gamecock won the Selling Plate- easily from Kelpie, Trumpeter, and Doctor ; and Cunnamulla gave us a hint as to his merits by easily winning the Sportsman's Handicap, 1 mile and 3 furlongs, with 7st. 31b. in the saddle, beating Rainbow, 7st. 51b., Saunterer, 8st. 71b., Creswick, 9st., and five .others, in 2.28. On the second day Satellite, 9st, 31b., Eros, list. 61b., and Black all, Get, 101b., filled the places for the Hurdle Race ; and then Bryan O'Lynn won tie Rowley Mile with 6st. 41b., by a neck from Verdict, 7st. 61b.,with Prima Donna, 6st. 71b., third, in 1.42 8-10. Piracy, Hecla, and Saionara filled the places as named for the Claret Stakes, and the five furlongs were disposed of in 1*5. Balthazar, 6st. 81b., Major, 6st. 51b., and Kelpie, 6st 81b., occupied the places in the Public Auction Stakes; and Hawthornden, 7st. lib.. Rainbow, 6st.' 101b., and Cunnamulla, 7st.', rattled home in order for the Railway Handicap, 1£ mile, in 2.16. April the 10th, 12th, 14th, and 15th were the dates on which the Randwick Autumn Meeting was played out, but the manner in which the various races were won and lost must still be fresh in the memories of your readers, and I shall therefore only give a brief record of the first, second, and third horses in each race and the time.

The next meetings were those of the South Australian Jockey Club and the Adelaide Racing Club, and the items that were then discussed are still so fresh in the memories of your readers that it is unnecessary to repeat them, and so having ' harked back' to all the principal meetings, 1 shall drop the subject, which has been dry writing, and must be equally dry reading, but is, nevertheless, a necessary ' refresher'' in a colony where 'Turf Registers' are un known.
