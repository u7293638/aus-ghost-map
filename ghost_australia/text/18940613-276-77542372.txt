" THE GHOST." (To the Editor of the Border Watch,) SlB,-For the past fortnight; eome alarm has been oreated amidst timid women and girls by ominous stories of the doings of a mythioal personage commonly called "the ghost. The foundation for these reports of 11 silly trloks " and "idiotic pranks" appears to be as obscure as tha " hoodlum " who is causing the trouble, As the age of the ghost inoreases the stories of his ramblings grow until they are in every body's mouth. I have investigated moat of the adventures of those whom report sayB 11 the ghost has patronised, and have found them all to end in smoke. The Btory which deserved most credence was that a lamplighter met " the ghost" on the Penola-road and was so overcome that he could not pull the trigger of a revolver, which be only brought on the scene when he returned a Quarter of an hour later, iD company with a policeman resolved to " lay out" the apparition. Other stories more preposterous are related in any quantity, but that they are believed by, or at least have as egeofc upon, any one goes to show that supersti tion is almost a& rife cow as in the Dark Agos, Very few me to tee of lbs p9< called ghost, and the epithets of imbeoile and hoodlum bo freely ascribed to the vapory individual would have been better applied to those who attach importance to the stories that are being ciroulated about him. When people enquire into the matter they will find that the supposed ghost has existed only in imagination, and those who deserve to be punished are those who assist the soare by inventing and oiroulating the reports. I goad you this with the purely benevolent object of Bqunehing " the ghost." YOUIB, SC., X.Y.Z.
