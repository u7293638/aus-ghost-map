THE ELEMENTS. BY A LOWER FORM BOY. There are some elements are winter, mr and wind, there may be some more, but those are all I know anything about Tire is caused by striking a match, and then lighting a candle or anything like that was 4th it. If the match goes out before you have lit vom candle you won't have my fire so then you have to keep on sinking more till 'oil delight it When I was home last v action I struck no less than nine matches one night in my room how to light the gas I had been leading a ghost story before coming to boil and when I came into the room I thought I saw something mov- ing in a link corner I broke of the beads off six in succession and then I got so excited that I blew two out as soon as I had lit them, the ninth one did the luck When the light flared up there was nothing in that corner only an old jacket I could have an oil that jacket was moving when I came into the room You needs the thinking I was frightened, and that was what made me waste the matches I was anxious to get a bit of light on the subject or ob- ject that was nil, so there I like reading ghost stones in the day time The-he ends of matches me made from bluestone and some other things mixed up when you strike a match the brim- stone lights itself that's what you call spasmodic combustion By the stone is nil light when it is used for matches , but I think it is a shame to make kids cat it along with a eade Uko I was made once Of course I didn't funk taking it, but, all the same I didn't care for it if you have tried the mixture yet, you ought to I didn't like it, but you may , tastes differ, you know Before matches were invented people used to get fire by rubbing sticks together and other ways I cut a nick in the edge of my desk at school once, then I rubbed the edge of a flat ruler over it back. this and forwards, as hard as I could I believe e I would have got fire, only I had to chuck it, it was so jolly rough on the inlet Water is the element that is the direct opposite of fire, if you pour a kettle of water over the fire you will put it out Of course water is used for other things, besides putting out flies For instance, you can drink it, but it's not nearly so nice by itself as it is with seibert in it Shotbolt goes very well with water, but doesn't go well with tea or anything like that I put some in my tea once instead of sugar but I didn't care for it Water is used for lots of other things besides for drinking, far too many things to go over in this essay Ifc can be used for almost any thing but lighting fires with Air is the most necessary of all the elements if there was no such thing as air, I wouldn't be writing this essay now , also there would be no such things as pneumatic tyres which would be a final loss Bicj des ain't much use unless you have pneumatic tyres, solid tyres are all very well in their way, but they're just a wee bit too solid when you go over a back when you're riding pretty hard We have one of those big high bone- speakers at our school that belongs to the school in general and nobody in particular Me and the chaps have a rare lark with that old bike occasionally She's not so bad when you're riding on the level ground, but going down hill she s a tartar, and, if you see a cart ahead and can't stop she's a very e sinker, too, for there's no stopping that bike in the middle of a lull one wouldn't have been quite so bad if young Brown hadn't cut bits out of the tyres for indiarubber, Brown is always doing many things like that The wind is an element that is much the same thing as an only a little different When you have me, you don't feel uncomfortable, when you have wind, after eating your dinner too fast you do There me four kinds of wind flames east west north, and south There is also another wind called an ill w mci but I never had much to do with it its not in my line Seamen would rather have any sort of wind than none at all I like a good gusty day , it's a grand ball watching mon's hints blowing off especially if the hat get's run over Good blowy days are first-rate for the hat trade I think it is a very good plan on a show day to take your hat off and carry it under your arm, it's better than running the risk of losing it, anyway I haven't said anything about ice-I think it is another element, but, as I'm not quite sure I'll not say anything about it. There is one kind of elements I can't bear and those are the Elements of Euclid Boy's Own Paper "
