But not the Colonel ; he did not desire to laugh — had not laughed, in fact, for something: like twenty, years, that is to Bay ever since ? he began to live on his wits. These Bavages of Ceylon, who never laugh, and only begin to smile when they are defunot and ghosts; live on their wits, whioh accounts for their melancholy. What the Colonel waB contriving was pure rascality and robbery. Ift order to set up his gariiing Balbon-in the best style he wanted as much money to begin with, as he could command.
