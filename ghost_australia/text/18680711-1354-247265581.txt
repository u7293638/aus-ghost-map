With some trouble X captured my one, a tidy . little'irori'grey nag, which; I judged from. the;fiad4}e^nd,, accoutrements, ;must have been , an'-officer's ' charger; ' it was easy to see from the etateofthe saddle that the former* ider had been diBBperately wounded, and the reins, too, were bloodier than a dainty'Han would have liked, but X was noways squeamish, and mounted the . little horse in a twinkling. The .moment I had gotftl<ny,rseat: I -gftlloped up .to .the Heavy me minute»tfl^hen up > cajnp i M H f f adiutant;'>on. his. ;old: bay-mare, ra '-terfipj[e gaSopV tod jpared 'to imp toif Go to>'h; j* ? out of that.* There's no mistake, I wki nbt turned uj face. aW and barkened with' bleod, . _ _ picked up at thB butchering the day before, aitd had never wiped off. A pair of long greasy jack boots came up. to the thigh, and inst&act;' bf "a sword I' had the" ozej'oyjecjmy shoulder at.ithe slope as regim^al as you The Bussian must .haveridden very short,. for my : knees were up to v my nose in Jii» stirrups, and so yp» may imagrne that, taking top all in all, Iiwas rather a hot-look ingfmemBer, especially if you. remember that 1 was fully hatf'seas'iqviMv - '•?' i; | '' The Heavies were in position to support the Light Brigade, which , h|id jU§t ,go£ the• word to Wie^Eujals ordered ine^off, I looked straiglfi; before one, und s.iw the light bobs going out to the front at an easv trot, and on the Tight of the front., rank I. caught sight of the plumes in the lauce hats of>my own Corps, old seventeenth. • My .mind was.made up on the instant. Rainmiug my spurless heels into the ribs of the little Bussian horse, I started off in pursuit of the Light Brigade as fast as I could ihake him go, wi th sh outs of laugh ter froin the^ -hea\' ies ringing behind me, and chased unsuccessfully by a couple" of officers of the Greys; who tried to stop me for decency's • sake. As the light bobs were only advancing at a trot, I wasn't-lohg before l ranged Up along»: side their right flauk, and their was ^bid- Nosey, as we used to call -Cardigan; well out to the front, and in front of him again was young Nol&n; ofthb 15411', with his sword do Wat the ' right engage' alrgady.altuough we were a long way off any enemy. Just as I came up in a line Vith the flank sergeant of the front rank, who looked sideways at me as if I had been a ghost, Cardigan turned round;. inT his] eaddle ;-!tp say a word to the field trumpeter riding at his heels, and then, with a wave of his sword, Went off at score out to thfc front. In another second all the trumpets of the brigade sounded the ' charge,' atid sitting down on our saddles and setting our teeth hard, off we went pell-mell across the valley as hard as ever horse could lay foot to the ground. Presently we got within range of the devilish Eus&ian; battery which was playing right into our teeth, and I saw Nolan, who was a long way out to the front, galloping as if for a wager, toss up his arms, and, with a wild shriek, fall from his horBe. On still, on we went, faster andifaster. • as pur. horses, got excited and warmed to their. worK, heedless of the torrent of shot that came tearing through 'us, and stopping for ever many a bold rider. As for myself, what with drink in me, and the wild excitement of the headlong charge, I went stark mad, and sent theplucky Russian horse ahead at a pace which kept me in line with the very foremost. Nearer and nearer we came to the dreadful battery, which kept vomiting death on us like a volcano, till I seemed to" feel on my cheek the hot air from the cannon's mouth. At last we were on it. Half-a-dozen' of us leaped in among the gurs at once, and I one blow of mv axe brained a Russian gunner just as he was clapping the lint- '•stockitd the toucli-hole of bis piece: With another I split "open* the head"of an officer who was trying to rally the artillery detachment, in the. rear, and then what of us were left went 'smack through the stragglers, •Cutting and slashing like fiends, right straight at the column of cavalry drawn up behind the battery. What happened then, say you ? I can't tell you much more than' this, that they were round us like a swarm .ef bees, and we, not more seemingly than a 'couple of dozen of us to the fore,, were hack- 'ing and hewiug away our hardest, each individual man the centre of a separate melee. 1! know I never troubled about guards my- - %elf, but kept whirling the ase about me, %very now and then bringing.it down to 3some purpose, and ever as it fell the Bus-. ,kies gave ground a bit, only to crush denser round me- a minute after. Still nothing seemed to touch me. They dursn't come to close quarters 1 with the sword, for tlio axe had a devil of a Jong reach, and they, dursn't use pistols, for they were too thick themselves. I'm hanged if I don't think I should have been there till now had I not chanced to hear above the din a trumpet -from Bomewhere far in'the rear sound ' Threes about.' Bound I wheeled, still thrashing about me like a windmill,' slap througli the heart of the battery again, knocking over an artilleryman or two' as I passed, aiid presently overtook a small, batch .of men pf Various- regiments, who, under Colonel Sewell, of the 8th, were trying to'retreat in some kind of order. I was. as sober as a bishop by this time, take my word "for itj and I joined them right cheerfully, but the, cliances of getting back again to 0ur:0WD side of the valley looked very -blue. The Russian cavalry were hard on.-'oui; ' heels, and we, suffered sorely from ,the t devilish battery in our rear, which kept/.pelting into the thick of us, without much discrimination between friend and foe. The guns on those forts on our left; out of which the cowardly Turks had sneaked, arid ' which had' been pounced upon by the Russians, svere not do- : ing us inu6h good neither, I assiU-e you, and it was all the world like being ( between the devil and .the deepvWal I S^on ! : what little formation we had got was knocked to pieces; and then the word was ' Every man for himself, and Q-od help the liitidm'ost.V A young, fellowof the 11th Hussars and myself hiingtogether for a while, both of jis tryiug t(> make the most of our blown aud jaded horses, but at last down he went, his horse shot.tinder him and himself wounded; As the lad ! s' busby rolled off; when his head touched the ground, he gave a look up at,me which went 7 to ; nay heart, rough as I was.'
