How, let me dell dat Gofnor Dare is a holy place, Set aside in Ewig-Keit For de Veslenes to grace. Dare vill not be dat Gofnor, Hor any but Veslenes ; Hor any Christian peples, Bishops, priests, or qveens. Farevell, my noble Gofnor, I veep, I veep for you ; Ho Veslenes at your barty, Only Christians and a Jew,
