WHEN LOVE PASSED BY. I was busy with my ploughing, When Love passed by. 'Come,' she cried, 'forsake thy drudging; Life's delights are few and grudging; What hath man of all his strivings, All his planning and contriving, Here beneath the sky? When the grave opes to receive him Wealth and wit and honours leave him— Love endures for aye!' But I answered: 'I am a ploughing. When with straight and even furrow All the field is covered through, 'I will follow,' Love passed by. I was busy with my sowing, When Love passed by. 'Come,' she cried, give o'er thy toiling? For thy moil thou hast but moiling: Follow me, where meadows fertile Bloom upsown with rose and myrtle, Laughing to the sky: Laugh for joy the thousand flowers Birds and brooks—the laughing hours All unnoted fly.' But I answered: 'I am sowing. When my acres all are planted, Gladly to thy realm enchanted I will follow.' Love passed by. I was busy with my reaping, When Love passed by. 'Come,' she cried, 'thou, plantedst grisving, Ripened sorrows art thou sheaving. If the heart lie fallow, vain is Garnered store. Thy wealth of grain is Less than love's least sigh. Haste thee—for the hours fast dwindle Ere the pyre of Hope shall kindle In life's western sky.' But I answered: 'I am reaping. When with song of youth and maiden, Home the hock-cart comes, full laden, I will follow.' Love passed by. I had gathered in my harvest, When Love passed by. 'Stay,' I called—to her, swift speeding, Turning not, my cry unheeding— 'Stay, O Love, I fain would follow. Stay thy flight, O fleet-winged swallow Cleaving twilight sky! I am old and worn and weary. Void my fields and heart—and dreary. With time would I fly. Garnered woe is all my harvest, Sad ghost of my dead hopes haunt me, Fierce regrets, like demons, taunt me— Stay!—I follow!' Love passed by. —Solomon Solis-Cohen in Scribner's.
