ANSWERS !CO CORRESPONDENTS. ' An Irish Philosopher.'— Your communi cation is most important. We shall call the atten tion of our readers to it, at a more fitting time than the present. ' Catholic Interests in Austra lia' 'will be promoted by your exertions. ' Anti-Bigot.' — We have read your commu nication, and the Rev. Mr. Threlkem/s adver tised, witless, un poetic rhapsody. Do not let the sleek, oily, Catholic-priest-hating ♦ Minister' disturb your serenity. There is not a good man and true Sn the community, be he Catholic or be ' he Dissenter, who does not sneer at the Rev. Priest- hater's trash, as most unbecoming— as ^uite unsuited — to the dignity and gravity of a Christian Minister. The Herald has certainly upheld its respectability, by obliging the Rev. Rhymer (or ex-coal-dealer) to pay for the pub lication of his stupid nonsense. Oke ! jam satis estl ''A Young Australian.' — We admire your attempt at verse. You will yet succeed. Study hard, read the best authors in our language, and enrich your vocabulary of words with numerous synonvyes. We recommend you, and all ' Young Australians1' Mooke's ' Irish ?Melodies,' ?as the best model of smooth, graceful, and harmonious versification in our language.

Virgin are, ' Ave Maria, gratid plena, Dominus tccum' — which when twisted into an (the) Anagram become, ' Deipera inventa cst, ergo immaculata.' .1 THE FREEMAN'S JOURNAL SATU11DAY, JUNE 16, 1S55.
