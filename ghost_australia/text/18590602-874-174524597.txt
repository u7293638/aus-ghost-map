JOHN O'BRAGGER. A TALE. BY THE GHOST OF BURNS. Impatience is a blundering guide, Amongst a people famous for reflection, Who like to play the fool with circumspection."—Byron When Politicians frae the House, Gang out to ha'e a whiles carouse; As Parlementin' hours get late, Or Greeves has ta'en up the debate; While they sit drownin' a' their cares, The Public's or their ain affairs. They think no o' the niest electin's The hustin's, questions, an' reflectin's, That lie atween them an' their seat, Or bow a' their constituents meet, Smokin' their pipes o'er weel fill'd glasses Au' ca' in' them a lot o' asses. Naething for these, cared John O'Bragger As he thro' Melbourne hame did swagger (Melbourne, that ev'ra toun o'er rules For upstart men an' purse proud fools.) Oh John, had ye tut been sae wise, As ta'en some people's kind advice; They tauld you Legislatin' capers Were never meant for linendrapers— That ignorance gaun daer't wi' riches Should na forget auld Irelan's ditches— That to be fit for legislation Required a wee bit education. They prophesied if you persisted Your upstart power wad be resisted; That weel-learn'd men at your careerin' An' ignorance wad, aye, be sneerin'. Ah! worthy men, it grieves me sair, To think ye did na find out mair, Ere he gat i' exalted places The would-be statesman now disgraces. But to our tale;—ae business night John shrug'd his shoulders wi' delight, For tho' they growl'd an' seem'd to grudge it, The members pass'd George Harker's budget, Beside him sat a country crony Wha voted wi' an' worshipped Johnny, "John lo'ed him like a ve'ra brither," They had cut turf at hame thegither. The night pass'd on wi' little bother— One item pass'd, an' then another! The Ministers an' John were hearty To see they had sae strang a party. If Adamson thought aught was wrong, The chairman's "hear, hear," stap'd his tongue. People outside might growl an' swear John gat the blunt an' did na care. Those who were wraith at John's delight, Smother'd it till some other night. * * * * Syme might be mad, but John was glorious O'er a' the Age's sneers victorious. But members are like headstrang women They'll bow or bend or yield to no man; An' John—though he, aye, suffer'd by it— Could never keep his temper quiet. Nae man can estimate his cheek Somethin' was said an' John maun speak, An' jist the time he gat his feet on, A wise man wad ha'e kept his seat on. The House shew'd symptoms o' a riot— The Chairman hardly kept it quiet. Wi' dread John frien's jest heard the sound O' smother'd laughter buzzin' round-- That night a chiel might plainly see The members meant to ha'e a spree. Dependin' on his roarin' voice — A louder ne'er address'd the house; John blither'd on for maist an hour Dispisin' pensions, place and power. Whiles hauding fast his auld black waistcoat Whiles quotin' what some hireling last wrote. * * * * (To be Continued.)
