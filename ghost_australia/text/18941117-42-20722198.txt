The Telephone for Stations. In the rapid transmission of messages electricity has gradually driven out every com- petitor, but the introduction of the telephone has brought those advantages within reach of all which were formerly confined to the few skilled telegraph olerks. Telephones can be used by any intelligent person, and are specially suited for facilitating the management of stations of large size by placing all parts in direot communi cation. Messra. Barton and White, of this city, have shown us a complete outfit of instruments, wires, insulators, and lightning guards, suoh as they have recently supplied to an inland station, to be ereoted by the station manager, with the aid of written instructions, the instruments being so simple that no technical knowledge is needed for successfully erecting and working them. Suoh instrument should find extended application in Queens land.— [Advx.] Speaking of the new volume of the " Pro ceedings of the Psychical Research Society," the Daily Chronicle says it contains a fine set of ghost stories: The ghost that rattles the fireirons and coughs ; the ghost that reads the Bible; the ghost in a cloak, covering its eyes with its hand; the ghost of the colonel who cat his throat; the gho3t that put its hand rotmd tho bed curtains—they are all here. It is a relief (says the writer) to turn to Mr. Balfoar's presidential address, which is a closely-reasoned appeal to scientific men to drop an attitude of "bigoted intolerance" and face the mass of strange phenomena which the Psychical Research Society has gathered so conscientiously. There can no longer be any doubt whatever that the Psychical Research Society has made aomo very re markable and infinitely suggestive discoveries, and this new volume is as full of them aa any of its predecessors.
