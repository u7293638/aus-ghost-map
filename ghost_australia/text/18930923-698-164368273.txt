The Criterion, Mr. Walter Bentley played Hamlet for three nights last week. His reading of the character ia unchanged from that previously given in Sydney, but in the cast there were many changes. Mrs. Molyneux wa3 the Ophelia, Miss Kate Bishop the Queen, Miss Ruth Wilmott the Player Queen, each seen in the characters for the first time in Sydney. Mr. C. Fabert. and Mr. Greenaway, who as the Ghost and Laertes respectively did well , were also new to Sydney. 'The FilverKing' was revivedon Satur day, this being the seventh production of the play, and as has been pointed out by one critic each time with a different king. Mr. Titheradge, Mr. Lawrence Uautiey, and JUr. lieorge xugnoia stana out conspi cuously as the kings ; Mies Henrietta Watson, . chief of the Nellie Denvers ; that of Miss Maggie Moore, taken at half an hour's notice, when Miss Maggie Knight (it is believed) wai suddenly taken ill, was one of the most meritorious; and Miss Annie Mayor's (the original in Australia) also ranked high. Jaifces has also had seven repre sentatives â€” poor Philip Day, Messrs. W, H. Vin cent, J. R. Greville, G. W. Anson, and Sterling Whyte being amongst the widely different actors ; the palm undoubtedly must be divided between the first and the last named. Mr. Walter Bentley's Silver King is somewhat artificial ; but the play is too interesting to depend upon one character, and in the vision scene he fairly roused the audience to enthusiasm. Mrs. Molyneux in the cottage scene was most successful ; Miss Ruth Wilmot made the most of her opportunity as Olive Skinner ; Mr. Frank Cates was a good ' Spider,' and plaved in the principal scene with Olive, with great vigour and effect. The part of Elijah Coorubes always recalls poor Redwood. Mr. H. Stoneham took a different line successfully, and Mr. H. A. Badger, hitherto known as an amateur hurdle-iacer (New Zealand), trod the boards profes sionally and satisfactorily as the Cabman.
