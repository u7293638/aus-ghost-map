EXCURSION TRAIN.--Tho Cruimissionors' offer of a cheap trip to the iMetropolis, on Thursday last, does not appear to have been availed of very much.

ThoeOommissiosers chotE a rather a, kward day for their favor, and it is not to be eondered at that they met with o little success in their enterprise; A train:run on aFriday evening or Satur day morning would be more sensible from: a pleaesre seeker's view,- but where-local storekiespors are concerned it would be any thing but a gratifying boon.
