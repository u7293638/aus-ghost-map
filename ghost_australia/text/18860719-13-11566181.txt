HER MAJESTY'S OPERA-HOUSE,.! " NELL GWYNNE." This theatre was crowded to excess on Saturday night, to witness the production of the new opera "Nell Gwynne," written by Mr li B 1 arms, and composed by R. Plan quelled, the musical author of "Les Cloches de Cornet Ettie" and Rip Van M ankle." "He pictures the story of the orange girl who became a popular actress and King's favourite is one which should lend itself readily to the purposes of comic opera. The present version of the oft-told story was first presented at the Avenue theatre, London, on the 7th February, 1884, where it was received with favour As the composer of the music of " Les Cloches de Corneville M Planquette has made for himself a fair reputation, and Mr H. B came, in translating and adapting from the French, has displayed talent AS an original play wright this last named gentleman is not quite so successful, and "Nell Gwynne,' as now presented, would have been much more effective if someone else had first written it for him in the language of Scribe, Meilhae, or Sardou The plot is attenuated and hard to trace. It is the outcome of mixed motives amongst a variety of people. Buckingham and Rochester (Signor Verdi and Mr Armes Beaumont respectively), being in disgrace at the Court of the Merry Monarch, have time to devote themselves to an amount in which they are both equally interested The object of their attachment is Jessamine (Miss Fannie Liddiard) the niece of Vessel, a miser and pawnbroker (Mr John I order) In order to be near her the two aristocrats become proprietors of the Dragon Inn, opposite her uncle s house, which, in the village, is named Rats Castle Buckingham and Rochester take it in turn, day about, to play at being landlord and servant in their own inn in pursuit of their object their policy is to ingratiate themselves with every one in the village, including the miser and the beadle (Mr E Kelly ), and as they charge nothing for the good cheer they provide, this part of their scheme succeeds beyond expectation. Jessamine, the niece already mentioned, is of susceptible age and romantic turn of mind, and has fallen very heartily in love with Falcon an actor (Mr li Allen), who hangs round Rats' Castle suitings pretty serenades, and gets himself pilloried by the villagers for being a stranger Nell Gwynne (Miss Emelie Melville) and Clare, a young lady, the King's ward (Miss Harcourt), come upon the scene Nell Gwynne penetrates the disguise of Rochester and Buckingham and, assuming the grandiose title of Lady Barbara, manages to say Borne peculiarly spiteful and irritating things to both gentlemen Domestic arrangements at the inn having become thoroughly disorganised through the lax discipline of the proprietors, the place stands in need of female help, and Lady Barbara recommends two young girls fresh from the country to fill the most important vacant places. It is needless to say that Nell Gwynne has resolved that she and her friend Clare will represent the country girls in question. At the end of the Great act we have Nell Gwynne and her companion masquerading and covertly thwarting the schemes of Buckingham and Rochester These last two have arranged with the beadle and the actor to exchange clothes and wait at night on the old miser, ostensibly to catch rats, but in reality to ensnare a sweetheart The beadle schemes out a plot of his own to be present in pursuit of Marjorie, the miners domestic servant ( Miss Kelton and sotbeBubsequent action of the piece is plainly foreseen The second act is laid in Weazel s house-a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends giving it the appearance of the interior of the Old Corio Bay shop It would be wearisome to follow in detail the farcical elaboration of the action throughout this scene, the usual expedient of the poverty stricken play wright is resorts I to in a wholesale manner Disguise and mistaken identity everywhere about in the thick of the confusion Nell Gwynne and Clare present themselves as prepared, and maize fearful predictions by means of a planchette, Every one of the actors in the scene is put wholly in the wrong, and the effect upon the miner, who send us to live in an atmosphere of ghosts, is such as to bereave him of his wits, the beadle, too, who is but lightly furnished in this respect, becomes a declared imbecile. The climax of the n tidly farcical is reached in the second act The third is devoted to restoring order and giving Nell Gwynne some opportunity for the display of those qualities of witchery and joyous humour which all love to dwell upon as being her own most genial characteristics It appears that this pursuit and he devilment of Buckingham have been undertaken by the sprightly Nell as a punishment for his having said at Court that Nell Gwynne was never an actress but always an orange girl in all that she did In rustic disguise euc captivates Buckingham by her ready adaptability and talent for the stage He promises to take her to Court to eclipse the Kings favourite The Merry Monarch (Mr G Dean) appears at this juncture, 'the charming Nell has her triumph Buckingham is confounded, but justifies his approval of Nell in disguise by saying that I None but herself could be her equal Rochester is married to Clare (the Kings ward), and Tallon, the actor, marries the pretty Jessamine As a dramatic composition the story has been conceived with little of invention and upon a low level of thoUght The performance of it on Saturday night showed here and there signs of that unreadiness which accompanies insufficient rehearsal By to night the management will have seen their way to economise time, and promote continuity of action Already some departure has been made from the original form in which the work was published, and as far as the animals are concerned this may be supposed to be a gain to the general vivacity of the performance the elaborate farcical ties of the second act want pruning and polishing to a great extent On Saturday night the overture commenced at a quarter to 8, and the final curtain fell at nearly half-past II Only works in grand form by Mel creer, Halevy, or Wagner repay such long sittings as this. M Planquette can disguise his hand in music as little as any composer with those style we are acquainted with him certain progressions have become mannerisms and a certain number of waltz songs seem to be the highest in each of his little operas On this understanding, the music in the work under notice will be found to be Hunt and pretty, with a fair proportion of nicely harmonised pieces for concerted solo voices, and a dis uncle recognisable and praiseworthy attempt to impart a conventional air of comicality to such buffo solo parts as the beadle s song, lia 1, in the 1.> act Miss Melville tills out well enough the character of the heroine as created by the literary author, but in the early parts of the play this is sketchy and without weight In the last act occurs the scene before alluded to wherein the actress has opportunity to display her quality the scene in the forest with -Ne.! (Gwynne passing through minuet undressing and giving herself with enthusiasm to the performunda of Green Sleeves was enthusiastically encored bailor Verdi fills an important move with satis- faction to the audience With Mr Beaumont in fine voice and well disposed towards the part allotted to him the Rochester of the evening was a perfect success. Approval is to be accorded to the pleasing interpretation by Miss Ethel Harcourt of the part of Clare the Kings ward, Miss Liddmrl fulfilled all that was required other in the pint of Jessamine, and Miss Kelton s performance us Marjorie was acceptable. The two well practised comedians, Messrs. J lorde mull Kell), excited long and hearty) laughter throughout the evening Mr Allen us the act jr, will be all the better for another night I rehearsal and a strict care for correct luton mon The chorus was numerous, and will be thoroughly effective, and the orchestra rendered good service. Nell Gwynne is announced for further repetition
