THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD. WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 1895. There is reason to believe that this afternoon Sir Henry Parkes will give notice of his motion of censure. It was stated yesterday that the coali- tion party only wanted the support of four members of the labour party to make its success assured. On the other hand, Ministers are confident that the labour party will stand by the freetrade side in consequence of the land tax and labour legislation. Early yesterday morning the now steel steam- ship Nineveh, of 3700 tons, with 40 passengers and 2000 tons of cargo, bound from London to Sydney, crashed on Cronulla reef during a fog. The vessel struck the reef at low tide. Four hours afterwards she was got off without assist- ance, and came into the harbour. The populace of Japan is excited and intensely disappointed at the agreement made by the Japanese Government not to permanently occupy the Liao-Tong Peninsula. Magato, the paramount chief of Zoutspansberg, in the north-eastern region of the Transvaal, has expelled the Transvaal Commission. A strong Boor forco in to bo dospatohed to tlio disturbod distnot, and it is expected that beary fighting will enano.

Tho nttcinpt was made, it moyho itsfmmod, in good faith by tho Rail- way Commissioners of the threo colonies coneorned; but when tho provisional ngree inont which they thought fair and practic- able lind been submitted to lhoir respec- tivo Governments, tho Government of Victoria speedily mndo up its mind that tho proposals could not bo accopted. If wo mistake not, tho decision to reject thom was communicated to our Government beforo its members liad had tho opportunity to consider tho matter. That movement, therefore, is at an end. Tho question now is, AVlmt next ? Mr. XinnvKii, in his communication, says : " 1 think a conference of Ministers to bo hold with regard to tho question could bo satisfactorily arranged." But why should thero bo any moro hope in ii conference of Ministers, who aro not railway experts, than in a conferenco of Commissiouors, who aro ? At tho first glance it would seem that tho probabilities lio tho othor way. Tho conforonco of Commissioners did manago to como to an agreomeiit. Thoy woro able to soo n possibility of compromiso for tho sako of tho removal of causes of friction and loss all round. Hut as soou as tho result of lhoir discussions carno boforo tho Vic- torian Cabinet it was sot asido, na if in tho view of tho politicians such a compromiso was out of tho question. Tho conclusion arrived at by tho Cnbinot was that " tho interests of tho colony would suffer greatly if tho ngreemont woro car- ried into effect." Hut if a Ministerial conforonco woro hold, similar conclusions might bo roaohod by tho representatives of tho othor colonies when proposals woro submitted by the Victorian Minister in accordanco with his own viows. It is hard to seo why, if tho Commissioners liavo failed, tho Ministors should succood. It can bo woll understood that, whilst tho Commissioners dealt with the matter as railway commissioners and business mon, tho Ministers when thoy met, liko tho Victorian Cabinot when it mot, would troat .the question on differont linOB, and allow othor considerations than business considerations and the in- terests of tho railways to have intluenco and effect. Wo cannot doubt that tho prompt decision of tho Victorian Cabinet was duo to tho perception that it was not only tho intorost of tho railways as a rovonuo-colleoting dopartmont that was at stake, it wnB also, and in a greater degree, the iutorent of Melbourne and its trade and its prostigo that lind to bo weighed. " The Interest» of. the er colony would suffoi gioatly" That was tho lesult lookod foiwardto if any thing woro dono that would tend to tho relaxation of tho hold of Victoria upon tho trado of our torntorj, íuipoit and-export ahko Tho niovomont foi tho mitigation of tho ti allic contest lind ita ongm m tho conviction of tho railway authontios that tho loss nttnchiug to tho mnintounnco of tho stiugglo was becoming intolerable and ruinous Tho lailway revenue of Vic- to! ¡n had boen suffoi mg «t all points AVoek aftoi wook, and quartoi nflor qunrtoi, tho îeports of a steady dooronso twine in with a monoton) tending to in (luco a fooling of dospair And ) o\, in tho face of tho general loss, thoro was this special loss wantonl) incuriod in conttoc tion with tho trade of Now South Wales to bring tho strain up to tho criish mg point l'lio quostiou nroso, Could not somothmg bo dono lo oaso off this unnecossai) loss ?

But it would be a sorious mistako to think that in Now South Wales there is no neod for a vigorous conservanoy policy. What lins become of tho rod-codar forest of tho North for want of protoction ? Tho rod-gum forosls of tho Murray woro in danger of wholosalo donudntiou when just in time stops woro takon to conservo thom. Much harm has boon dono ; many a milo ouco covorod with valuablo troos is now that most hideous thing, a ringbarked aroa ; much land is invaded by pino and othor Bcrub, and much besido is ovorgrown with n choking crop of suokors and saplings. Yet thoro romain consider- able nrons of Crown lands, soino rosorred and somo opon to sa'to, upon which stands oxcollont timbor. It may bo protectod by boing difficult of acoess, but thoro it is, and 'as sottlomout advnncos it be- comes moro valuablo and moro ac- cessible Perhaps tho Forestry Do pnrtmont lins mndo n survoy of this land ; but if not, tho task is not unprofit- able, and would bo of much sorvioo in tho ovont of a Minister desiring, as is to bo wished, to placo tho forests of this colony under tho untold of wiso legislation. As the total aroa of timbor reserves in this colony is fivo and a half million acres, it might bo thought that wo aro woll pro- vided in that rospoct, and havo no neod of Mr. HOWITT'S warning. But it is probablo that Mr. CAMNIEU. would rnthor havo a much smallor aroa of country adapted for forestry than this lnrgo extent. It is understood that considerable pnrt of tho rosorves consists of lnnd oithor out of tho way or so poor as to bo pnssod ovor by intending sottlors. And ns upon othor rosorvos tiinbor-cutting goes on under royalty, thoy cannot bo considered as reserves in a truo sonso. No ouo would think that to koop maturo tim- bor from cutting till it docnyed was any- thing elso thnn a most unwise policy ; nor enn thoro bo objection to tho snlo of markotnblo trees. But for thoso re- moved othor troos ought to bo growing, mid this is porhnps ovor lookod in tho timber-cutting nrons. And in such reserves ns still contain good timbor thoro is much pressure to wrest thoso lands from tho .Forestry branch, mid open them to what is collod Rottlo monf, moaning just tho taking off of tho standing timbor for tho prico of tho small doposlt nnd a few instalments. So that thero is still a good deal to bo dono in tho intelligent conseivnncy of what remains of our timbor ro sourcos. A\"hat is most needed is to permanently vost in tho depnrtmont tho rosorves suitnblo for its purposes, and to give it moro scopo for afforestation, whoro that is judicioiiR. And n sugges- tion may bo thrown out. It is likely thnt nn official, high in the administration of tho ndmirnblo ltidinn forest sorvice, will shortly arrive. It would bo well to ascertain either from him or his Govern- ment whothor a few cadets from this colony could obtain somo training in tho methods of tho Indian forest conservancy. Foiling thnt, it might be wiso to offer through tho Technical College n few scholarships tennblo nt Coopor's Hill, in England, or, by arrange- ment, in tho German Stnto Forest Con- servation Sorvice. It is not proiiinture to begin to think of dcnliug with our forests in a scientific manner.
