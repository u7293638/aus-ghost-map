On the occasion of the opening of one of tho recently-constructed lines; an enterprising caterer. 'for public amusement presented himself at the Spencer-street Railway Station, with (a :yourig jackassj lie ' intended to display to the wondering eyes of the ruitic Victorians still' unacquainted ?' with that historical' quadruped. 'Ho desired to' pay:: the1 carriage of the animal to its destination. Here -his1 troubles began. There were regulations and a1 tariff for the transport of horsed, cattle, and sheep, but none for donkeys-^at : least, of four-footed 'ones. Thfe Traffic Manager was not to be found,' and tho puzzled officials ' refused to book tho ' Jerusalem . pony' as a member' of either the hypophagous, ovine,' or bpvine' families. '? Hero ' was a' dilemma.' 'But the owner of the donkey-— a 'cute Yankee 'by tho way— was equal to the occasion.' He procured a largo packing case, aiid knocking out 'one of the sides, with the help ! of a hammer and a' few nails Boon constructed a species of cage, 'in which' the' animal; duly labelled, and weighed as 'excess; passen ger's luggage,' was safely conveyed to its destination in the guard's van. ' It canby no stretch of the imagination bo said, that Uiat donkey, at all events, was tho cause of the' displayof much wit in tlie Dopartmehtof Railways; In his latest issue of regulations Mr. Gillies has provided for the 'transport of' hon. members, their wives, illustrious strangers,' and other' celebrities andndta bilities. ''? He appears, lidwever; to have for gottert to make' any provision for the ? carriage of donkeys. ' ; ' '_'?_?? : 1 Beyond tho generally known difficulty of catching the animal in a somnolent state, not much is 'known 'of' the habits of the weasel.; This is, perhaps, a matter for regret, as, owing : to this ig-' norance, the Governmentis unable to come to any decision in regard to an offer 'made to.-import thirty -thousand adult weasels'for the purpose of keeping the'rabbits in check, ' lately made by an' enterprising :fe tail liVe- ' stock merchant, who has hitherto dealt in canaries; lap-dogs, parrots; and such like small deer, but who 'is now anxious to start a wholesale business. The Ministry don't exactly know whether the change of habitat ? froirt one hemisphere : to : another might not induce a 'radical alteration; in 'ye manners and ^customs ?' of' the' sharp- nosed little' vermin.
