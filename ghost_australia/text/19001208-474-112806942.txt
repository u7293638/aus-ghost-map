DEATHS FROM FRIGHT. ' I havo interested myself somewhat in looking up unuaual causes of death,' said a well known physician, 'and have met several well-authenticated instances whero fright was tho cause. Tho English Surgeon General Francis tolls of a drummer in India ] across whose legs a harmless lizard crawled when he was half asleep, Ho was BUro that a cobra had bitton him, and it was too much for his nervea, and ho died. 'Frederick I. of Prussia Waa killed by fenr. His wife was insane) and oho day sho escaped from her keeper, and, dabbling her clotheB in blood rushed upon her husband whilo he Was dozing in his chair; King Frederick imagined hor to be tho white lady whoso ghost was believed to invariably ap pear whenever the death of a member of the Royal Family was to occur, and he was thrown into a fever, and died in Bix weeks. ' But perhaps the most remarkable death from fear was that of tho Dutch painter Pontnian, who lived in tho seventeenth cen tury. One day he went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch some deaths' heads and skeletons fora picture he intended to paint. The weather was vory aultry, and while nkotohing he fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around him and tho skeletons suspended from tho cpiling clashing together. In a fit of terror he threw himself out of the window, and, though he sustained no serious injury and was informed that a slight earthquake had caused tho commotion among hiB ghostly surroundings, ho died in a few days in a nervous tremor. ' I eould cito many other cases where tho shock to tho nervous system Which wo know as fright has produced death.'
