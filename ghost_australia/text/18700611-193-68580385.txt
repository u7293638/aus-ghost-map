For, lying awake so many a night, I have learu'd at last tio catch . From the crowing cock; and the clanging clock, and the sound ,f the heating watch, A wisty sense of. the measrelcos march of Time, as he passes here, Leaving tmy life behind him ; and 1 know that the dawn is near. Sleep a little. I shall not die to-night. You may leave me. Go. Eh ! is it tune for the drink ? must you ix it! it dots me no good. But thanks, old friend, true friend i I,woitld" live for your sake, if I could. Ay, there are some goodthings in life, that fa I not, .away with the rest. And, of all hbest things upon, earth, 1.oll that a faithful friend is the best. For woman, Will, is a thorny flower : it bi eaks, and we bleed anxd sntiart : The blossom falls at the fairest, and the thorn runs into the heart. And woman's love is a bitter fruit ; and, however he bite it, or sip, There's many a man has lived to curse t'he taste of thaut fruit on his lip. .But never was any man yet, as I ween, be he who . soever he may, That has.known what a true friend is, Will, and wish'd that knowledge away. You were proud of my promise, faithful despite of my fall, Sad when the world seem'd over sweet, sweet when the.world.turn'd gall : When I cloak'd myself in the pride of praise from what God grieved to see, You 'ina trlo' the glittering lie of it all, and silently mnoirn'd for me: When the world took back what the world bhd . given, and scorn with praise chang'd pl.ice; I, from my sackcloth and'ashes, look'd up, and saw hope glow on your face : Therefore, fair weather be yours, Will, whether it shines or pours, And, if I can slip from out of my grave, my spirit will visit yours. O woman eyes'that bave smiled and ramiled, 0 woman lips that have kist The life- blood out of my heart, why thus for ever do you persist, Pressing out or the dark all round, to bewilder my dying hours With 'your ghostly sorceries hrew'd from the breath of your poison flowers?
