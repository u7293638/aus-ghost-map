Society like our own may, when taken by itself, l-e regarded as a matter of no great interest. Tho facts that we have to report are small in thomselves, and can only embrace in a general way a few topics, such as the numlier of our subscribers, the amount of our snbsewptions, and similar points, with tho cuniparison of the work of one year w,Uh another. But when we take a wider, ami more comprehensive view, and contemplate our local branch as forming part of the groat Bihlo Society at home; or, to use the language, of the Apostle.
