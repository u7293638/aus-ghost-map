THE BARRABA ESTATE, ELLALONG.—Mr E. C. Close, who is known as one of our oldest and most respected residents has disposed of his well known Barraba, Quorrobolong and Con gewai Estates to the Messrs Dodds. While Mr Close will be missed from our midst, should he decide upon leaving the dis- trict it is gratifying to know that in the Messrs Dodds he has worthy successors. They have purchased the whole of the cattle, horses, &c.;, on the above estates, and we learn that these young men (who are sons of Mr Alex Dodds who at one time represented in Parliament the constituency of East Maitland) have had considerable experience among cattle and horses upon some of the best stations in the North, and no doubt they will be able to turn their experience to advantage in the breed- ing of horses and cattle of a good stamp.
