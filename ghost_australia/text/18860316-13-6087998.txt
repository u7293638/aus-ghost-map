TUESDAY, M AUCH IG, ISSU The meeting of Parliament today is awaited with more than the ordinary curiosity, in as much as no one exactly knows what sort of an Assembly this is that the free and independent electors of Victoria have been pleased to call into existence. The proceedings should be little, more than formal. Parliament is convened not for the transaction of business but in order that the payment pleasantly, disguised under the title "reimbursement of expenses" may commence at the earliest possible, oppor- tunity. A desire to convenience hon. members loads Minsters to initiate the session before the Government themselves are ready with their busi- ness. Hon members are well aware of this, and independently of any effort of tricksy spirits to stir up strife at once, the manner in which the proposal for an adjournment is received will indicate a favourable or unfavourable disposi- tion. A successful opposition to a proper adjournment is not probable. Common sense will tell every elector that there is danger in hurrying on with an irrigation scheme, every point of which ought to be thought out, in as much as every point will be canvassed. Nothing is more easy than to make a botch of the business, and nothing would be more disastrous to the colony than a failure. If the colleagues of Mr Gillies had had twenty-four hours to consider his address to the electors of Rodney, some of them, weo apprenend, would have desired to modify certain of its terms in connexion with, irrigation, and they want leisure now to work the subject out.
