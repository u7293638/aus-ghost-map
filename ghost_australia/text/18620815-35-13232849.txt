THE LATE RIFLE MATCH. ST. LEONARD'S AND WINDEYER'S TEAM. To the Editor of the Herald Sin, Thomas prudent plan for the vanquished often is to take their beating and say nothing about it, but the introduction in to day's Herald to the score in the ab ivo much shows a little rain us which I think calls for a few remarks from some of us The shooting at the very first rings is described as evidently showing the superiority of the S) dney men as good shots, they having, out of -30 points and hits on both sides, scored eight more than their opponents Why, Sir, every one that has the slightest experience of match shooting must know that such a difference sunk s no superiors) on either side It might be and in this case was, the result of the merest accident cured by five or six misses made on our side by men who at other times, and under other circumstances, would have had ed fourteen or fifteen to the score. Even leaving missing out of the question, such differences as Uns him a frequently been more than made up in the course of a i inch shorter match then the above Whatever might have been the general annexation as to the result of the match, the anticipations of the St Leonard's men have not been much disappointed I believe very few of us anticipated that we should, under all the circumstances, be the victors. We are only a small company numerically, numbering not much more than half of any one of the Sydney Companies The ten opposed to us were supposed to be a selection of about the ten best that could be got together from the Sydney A volunteers of all arms, with the exception of a single company-No 4 repre- senting a eoiistititiiiry more than ten times our number We did not, therefore, as already stated anticipate beating them, but we did hope that we should be able to show that these ten men were not the very best ten that might bayonet selected to uphold the honour of the district, and we have shown this, inasmuch as of the ton In ghost porcH on both sides in the late match, four of them are St Leonard s men, and the highest on both sides is also a St Leonard's man. It, then a small company like ours can show this, what might not be expected from the pick of the other companies But our anticipations have been more than realised The Sydney) men exceeded their score with the Maitland men They may therefore be presumed to have made pretty near their average shooting The) shot, too, on their own range, Leaving the wind on the side they are accustomed to have it, and may therefore be supposed to have known the correct elevation and the allow ance to be made for strength and direction of wind These, with the amount of wind that prevailed during the above match, were, over dis- interested poison must admit, very great advantages Our men, as a body, shot considerably below their average ninety of them very fourth so The ranges were unknown to us- Several of our most reliable shots scarcely ever, if at all, found the target at the long ranges, the shots, as afterwards ascertained, going usually over the target The wind was directly opposite in direction to what wonroaccuBtouied, and yet with all these dead in- fliges, so far are we from considering that the Sydney men have got, as yOur report states, an easy victory over us the result of the late match has convinced us that at our own, or any neutral range we could beat the whole ton, and we hope some of those days to have an opportunity of trying it, at all events A ST. LEONARD'S MAN.
