VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. TPttwp T)av. TBv Teleeranh.1 IT?rom onr SnecialRenorter.i Melhnnrne. October 11. The farst day of the racing carnival or lss5 is not likely to bs forgotten for some time, if only on account of the rain. The morning was stnrmv. but there seemed everv chance of the weather holding up until before the first race, when the rain came down heavily and continued until nearly 4 o'clock, fortu nately for the' club the people were on the course before the downpour commenced, so that the attendance was not interfered with, and the receipts were larger than they have been any previous Guineas day. Des pite the wet there were no accidents, and ex cepting for the long delay at the post in the Great Foal Stakes, everything passed off well. Mr. T. Watson was acting as Starter and he fined all the jockeys £10, while Williamson was suspended for the meeting. Racing began with the Maiden Plate, for which Read's stable provided a red hot favourite in Jocular, by Emulation out of Gaiety. Nothing else was backed with much spirit, and the books began well, as after looking well to the distance Jocular was very easily beaten at the finish by the Ballarat colt Recall. A good field weighed out for the Hurdle Race, and this time backers were correct in their judgment, as Duration, the favourite, came away in the straight, and won easily, his next dangerous opponent, Mistake, having fallen at the last hurdle. The fourteen competitors for the Foal Slakes were saddled in the rain, and most of the jockeys cantered down to the starting-post in their overcoats. The Sydney people made Acme a very warm favourite, bat both Maddelina and The Nun. carried plenty of money. The start was delayed fully ten minutes, and when at last the signal was given the race was virtually reduced to Acme, Munwyrtina, and The Nun, who were right away from the main body of the field. Between these three there was a very pretty struggle, and Hales had to ait down and ride hard on Acme before he could shake off the other two. Once the favourite got in past the others Bhe held her own cleverly and won with a little in hand by a neck. Maddelina was a length from the dead heat pair, but her chance was spoilt at the Btart, as Bhe was left at the post, and could never get through her field until they entered the straight The good form shown by Acme caused Monte Christo to be made a favourite for the Guineas, but he went so badly in his preliminary that backers of Ringmaster took courage and supported their colt heavily. Dunlop was the only other supported, and he was only befriended in a half-hearted manner, owing to the general opinion that he was short of fast work. The race was run at a good sound pace, and backers of Monte Christo were on good terms with themselves until Robertson took Dunlop to the front at the home tarn, when the grey collapsed like a pricked bladder, and was out of the race in a few strides. Dunlop came into the straight pulling double, but when Ringmaster tackled him at the distance his want of con dition told, and Ringmaster drawing away won easily. Dunlop strugsled home gallantly under the whip, and saved second placa from Eagle Grange. The winner is a small colt to 'carry Derby weights, but he is a strong little fellow, and made very light of his 8 st. 5 lb. in this race. Directly the betting on the Hunters' Cup opened Tanglefoot and Narrung were heavily backed, and before the flag fell the Adelaide horse waa in demand, and £503 to 62C0 was taken. Abdallah and Spring were the only others supported for money. Gippslander made the running and soon held a lead of 50 yards from Chesterfield and Robert the Devil, all the field jumping splendidly. Crossing the treble Robert the Devil took second place, but going along the back Btretch Mr. Glasscock began to creep up with Narrung, and at the last fence he was within a length of Gippslander. Both horse and rider were pretty well exhausted, however, and Narrung led into the straight, and though he blundered through the last hurdle he won by six lengths. The winner carried the colours of Mr. Charles Hart, and that gentleman backed him heavily. The followers of Foukham's stable served up Sirocco a moral for the Toorak Handicap, and in .anti cipation of his easy victory they backed him at 1C0 to 5 for the Caulfield Cup. la the race Sirocco looked well until the turn, when he died away without being able to make a struggle, and after a good race Mentmore beat the other favourite by a neck, though he had to undergo the ordeal of a protest before getting the race.

Claudia, Melodius, and Ringmaster. When they had settled into their places Lady Claudia was making play from Melodius and Ringmaster, with Parwan head ing Monte Christo and Juanna, the field being whipped in by Eagle Grange. On the hill Melodius supplanted Lady Claudia, with Dunlop, Juanna, and Monte Christo following, and they ran in this order to the six-furlong post, where Monte Christo and Dunlop were in attendance upon Melodius, while Ringmaster and Juanna had headed Lady Claudia. At the wall Monte Chruto was at the girths of Melodius, Dunlop being very handy on the inside, and before they rounded the turn Dunlop ran to the front, and directly the pace was in creased Monte Christo and Melodious were beaten. Ringmaster then took second place and followed Dunlop into the straight, the others being headed by Eagle Grange and Parwan. The leader was going well up to the distance, bnt he went all to pieces when Ringmaster challenged, and the little brown drawing away at his ease won by two and a half lengths. Dunlop secured second place by half a length from Eagle Grange, who beat Parwan by a head, and then came Monte Christo, Juanna, Melo dious, and Lady Claudia in the order named.
