HOME TOPICS AND EVENTS. (Tuon otra connÂ£sro:!DE>-r.) LONDON, Nov. 6. The news of Mr McKinley's sweeping victory in the contest for the American Presidency has been received here with a sense of distinct relief The despatches from reliable sources had prepared us for this result, but until the figures were actually known there was a sense of tension which made itself visible far outside the limits of the Stock Exchange Curiously enough it was the Experts who were as a rule the alarmists When the contest began the British public at large at once made up its mind that a man holding Mr Bryan's views could not stand a ghost of a chance But people who mo sup posed to know the hidden forces of American politics shook their heads gravely with the advice " Don't be too sure , " and as the accounts of Mr Bryan's indefatigable powers and of the enthusiasm which he had succeeded in awakening among certain classes of his countrymen came in the feeling of uncertainty steadily spread One of the most noteworthy things about the contest is the public interest with which it his been followed from the beginning in this country As a rule American politics have had very little interest for the British public, and the London newspapers, especially of the cheap and popular class, have shown the same indifference, not to say ignorance, in regard to American political life which they are still apt to display in respect to what passes in the colonies, although the doings of the Courts and Chambers of petty Continental States may be sedulously chronicled But the ups and downs of the contest which is now over were minutely recorded, the chances of each candidate carefully analysed, and the detailed forecasts sent by cable conspicuously printed I doubt even now whether of any three men whom one meets in the street more than one could give anything like an intelligent account of the system under which the President is elected, but the interest with which the late election was followed must have had an educational value This interest was not due to the candidates, for their names were practically unknown beforehand to the average newspaper reader, and although the issues were important, I doubt whether even this explains everything I should rather be inclined to attribute the eager- ness for news to a healthy widening of popular interests and of newspaper enterprise The proposal to establish the referendum in New South Wales has naturally attracted attention among politicians at home, and has given rise to some newspaper comment One journal genially expresses the hope that the two Houses of the Colonial Legislature will soon have a quarrel in order that we in this country may have the opportunity of seeing how the experi- ment works There is a small group or members in the House of Commons who have always wished to see something of the kind tried in connection with the British Parliament The learned and eccentric member for East Edinburgh, Dr Robert Wallace, for instance, has repeatedly placed a resolution on the subject upon the paper of the House of Commons, and it is almost certain that a place for a similar motion will be balloted for at the beginning of next session The objection of course, which the mass of English Radicals would take to such a method of settling disputes between the two Houses in present conditions is that it would imply an equality between the House of LorIs and the Representative Assembly Just as they deny that the hereditary House has any right to force a general election, so they would refuse to admit that it could claim on any specific question to challenge the authority of the House of Commons in giving expression to the will of the country Another item of news from Sydney which has recently attracted some attention is the detailed statement of the scheme by which it is proposed to establish the system of old age pensions Pro bible, in due course, this will find its way before the expert commission appointed by the Tion sure to consider the various plans on behalf of the Home Government, but it is pretty certain that if a scheme is submitted to Parliament it will be of a much more tentative character than that which has been outlined in New South Wales Mr Chamberlain has taken the opportunity in the last day or two to re-assert his unalterable attachment to the general principle , but it is by no means certain that the majority of his colleagues in the Cabinet are enthusiastic about it. The Chancellor of the Exchequer especially is said to shake his head gravely over the prospects of such a scheme Mr Chamberlain himself still adheres to the idea that most of the money shall come out of the pockets of the beneficiary so as to make the scheme practically one of compulsory thrift, and people who know the working classes of this country will think that this fact alone will prove fatal to the whole proposal. The political dead season at home is now fairly over, and the first of the Cabinet Councils to pro pare for next session his been held The Government, in spite of their overwhelming majority, have no slight task in front of them It appears certain that the beginning of next session there will be a series of warm, if not stormy, debates on matters of foreign policy. The Armenian question is bound to lead to a heated discussion The threatened advance on Khartoum is another con- troversial matter, and this involves the reopening of the whole of the Egyptian question As I pointed out last week, the South African difficulty is still far from settled In home matters, too, the Government will have difficulties to encounter which are distinctly aggravated by the fact that they are so powerful, and are consequently expected by their friends to accomplish so much It is now evident that their clerical friends have brought them between two fires on the education question, and that whether they decide on rats aid of State aid for the voluntary schools they will equally have to prepare themselves for hostile criticism from their own benches The protectionists, too-in spite of the fact that ng cultural prospects are better are stirring themselves from a feeling that if they cannot got something done to meet their views under present conditions they are not likely to get it done in future From a very similar feeling the members who are interested in the services are moving, and the particularly economical Chancellor of the Exchequer now in office may expect to find himself confronted with fresh demands especially in connection with the manning of the navy I As far as the Armenian question is concerned we have to thank the French Government for the first glimpse of light Our own Foreign Office is so prodigiously reticent that not even a hint has been allowed to leak out as to what the Ambassadors have been after all this time at Constantinople, and the result has not been to increase the reputation of diplomacy The prevailing feeling on the part of the average Briton at the present war time was, to tell the truth, not badly summarised by a working-man orator at one of the meetings on the Turkish outrages, when he declared that the Ambassadors " were a pack of old women, who could not deal in a year with a difficulty which half a dozen men of business could settle in 10 minutes " The orator may not have taken account of all the intricacies of the situation , but I am bound to say that the " old woman " estimate has in polite forms gained ground with the educated as well as the uneducated classes in this country and not only with the educated classes but with people who have themselves had opportunities of becoming more or less expert in regard to matters of diplomacy The methods of the new world may be brusque as comp trod with old-fashioned European methods in regard to matters of this sort, but a good many people have been openly wishing that a little of the spirit, say, of American directness and energy could have been infused into our policy However, M Hanotaux has made it clear that the Powers are at least agreed that they must not only urge the Porte to make reforms, but insist on the Sultan's carrying them out on certain lines to be laid down for him This is a gun , but I am bound to say that the feeling in political circles here, especially among people who have had opportunities of knowing the character and disposition of the Sultan, is not hopeful They believe that neither by threats nor persuasion will Abdul Hamid and the crew which surround him ever be brought to adopt a policy of justice, and that the " bag and baggage " method alone will be worth anything. The impending revolution in street traffic has been heralded this week by the appearance on the streets of one or two neat and well-appointed electrical omnibuses They are not, however, exactly novelties, as they were tried experimentally some time ago, and a company has been formed for tho purpose of turning them to business account when the time comes Meanwhile, it carries one b lok in imagination to the days before rule days to read the accounts, in the country newspapers of the discussions which have taken place at the meetings of the local bodies in rural districts upon the impending innovation The new regulations issued by the Local Government Board limit the speed of the cars to 14 miles an hour pretty liberal arrangement it must be admitted but some of our rural magnates are of opinion that the speed ought to be reduced to eight, or even to six miles " Supposing,' asked one titled member of a county council triumphantly, '- a skittish horse meets one of these monsters on a country road, what then?" Ono is irresistibly reminded of the question put to Stephenson as to what would happen if a cow strayed on the railway line In other cases resolutions have been proposed with the object of hampering the new vehicles, because they would discourage horse breeding A number of timid people, too, have started a scare as to the danger to life and men involved in the use of the new motor cars in the streets The supposed justification of the scare is found in a few accidents which have occurred on the Continent as if there were no accidents from horse to affic under present circumstances However, there are plenty of people still in the prime of of life who can remember a time when petitions were being signed in country towns against the introduction of gas because of the danger from explosions, and we all know that a great states- man offered to eat the first steamboat which should cross the Atlantic So that taking things altogether I suppose the mail prejudices which the autocar has now to encounter are to be regarded as natural if not philosophical That universal favourite, the sea serpent, has turned up again a little late in the year, for our silly season is over He has been seen this time off Lowestoft, " going at the rate of five or six miles on hour, and in three out ves," and happening by accident to be in the neighbourhood at the time of the occurrence, I was able to hear with my own ears the report of some of the fishermen who saw the monster am not going to declare for his existence , but I will put on record the fact that after listening to quite independent versions, told by men who could not have been in communication with each other, I should have regarded similar, clear and definite testimony on any other subject as absolutely conclusive However, it is only a few days since that I heard a chief officer of one of our great ocean-going liners positively and solemnly assert in a voice which had all the accents of conviction that he and a fellow officer had a few weeks before seen a specimen of " the brute " so close under the ship's bows that they could tell even the texture of the skin The myth-if after all it be a pure myth takes a lot of killing outside the columns of country newspapers
