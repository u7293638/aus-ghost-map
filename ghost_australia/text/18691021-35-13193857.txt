As a Christian pastor, he was found to be a faithful and wise servant one whom the Lord, having made mier over his household-was able to give them their most in due season, " or, as it is elsewhere expressed, ' who bringeth out of his treasures things now old They knew that he was a most diligent student of Holy Vi fit, not only in the English, but in the languages in which it was originally wntten-llobrow and Greek Speaking of his ministrations, the Dean says, We believe his discourses to have been distinguished by their Scriptural fidelity, and also set forth in a manner well calculated to arrest the attention, and to make a deep impression on the minds of his hearers Sincerity of intention, diligence, impartiality and perseverance, all connected with ministerial fidelity, characterised him "Surely it becomes both pastors and their flocks to work while it is yet day, lest the ' night cometh when no man can work " He to whom we have been referring was of a manly and oven stalwart form, and to all human fÂ» chance might have been spared for many years to come yet has he been struck down in the vigour of his life, and the places where he was so our newly welcomed, shall see him no more than proclaims to us in unmistakable language,-' Watch, therefore, for ye I KNOW not at what hour your Lord doth come', ' And the Dean concludes thus,-" Let me beseech you to imitate the example of one we so bitterly lament, strictly to preserve the and; of the Spirit in the bond of peace And Suffer me now to enter on the altar of friendship more particularly, though very briefly, my per cent tribute to the memory of your life Moderator He was my early and attached friend the earliest I had on this side of the Equator Contemporaries at (ho Uni versal, associates at the termination of our Divinity course, sitting then under the same ministry, the earnest ministry of the late pious Rev Angus Kennedy, of Dornoch, licensed by the same Fresh tory, and making our first pulpit efforts in the same cathedral church, we often took sweet counsel together, till early ministerial employment for me in Scotland, and by and bye emigration by him, terminated our outward intercourse, but not our friend- ship and love Although his father, a medical man of extensive practice and influence, enjoyed the favour of the noble of Italy of Sutherland, and the young probationer was sure of obtaining a benefit from their extensive Church patronage, he preferred seeking speedily a field of usefulness abroad to waiting for a charge at home late Assembly, I trust, will excuse this rather lengthy notice, which, while it gratifies the feelings of a sincere surviving mind, comes appropriately from the chair, and may save the time, perhaps, by saving the necessity, of mdi A idual references by the members But the course of your Moderator is not the only loss of that kind which our Church has to deplore Another 1 labourer has been removed from the vineyards, in the midst of his usefulness in the ni}8tenousProvi peace of God, the Rev. John Thom, of the Richmond River, has, very lately, met his death by drown- ing and the lamentable event has cast a gloom over all that territory where he laboured Humble and affiliate 111, diligent in his work, and devoted to his Divine Master, he was deservedly esteemed and loved not only by the respectable Presbyterian whom he found before him on the Richmond, but also by the numerous families of our communion, chiefly from Shoalhaven, who have more lately settled there. He was a rare man, whose place cannot readily be supplied for, although we may soon find his equal in some respects, yet not in others He was a prince of a pioneer, he could find his way where others would set comly stray, he could push on and prosper where others would pincer peevishly abandon the field ' Let us, there fore, pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth labourers to His henry best I forbear noticing to see in this way in the ranks of our laymen but one striking case, similar to Mr Thomas, well known to a few of us, r FOR up now before my mind the Bid death of Mr James Davidson, of the Clarence River, a sincere Christian, an intelligent member of our Church, and true friend of our cause in that quarter, has deeply afflicted all who knew and v olued his worth But while we thus mourn losses in our Zion, we are not left to despond. We have the cheering prospect of being soon joined by a fresh force from our native land and already we witness with pleasure an accession to our strength from the sister colony of Queensland, follow an bitsadors for Christ,' to whose usefulness we look for ward withheld hope, and for whose spiritual prosperity and success in the yard of our Lord we feel bound ma inclined to pray . , , Fathers and Brethren, I have Hailed, or at least occupied to little advantage, so much of your time, that I am rodeo tent to encroach further upon it And therefore I may at once assure you that it is not may intention to launch out into remarks upon the merits of our system of Presbytery, in its doctrine, discipline, government, of worship, to set forth its excellences either absolutely or relatively viewed Neither do I purpose to speak of any of the current questions of the day, which are of public interest to us in common with other branches of the Church of Christ But I con- fine myself in my remaining remarks to the manner and spirit in which we should address our selves to the proper work of our Assembly, whether in its judicial or legislative 1 capacity. Allow me the, first, to indicate the injuries and Wine towards one another which becomes us in all our Scdings, which only can be accept able to God and l"5'"Â£ commend our cause and pro farmhand She told cve/el.spla) Christian went say an unaffected deference to the cranium and feel "Mofohcrs, true brotherly love, keeping in mm], and Sing to obey the clear, earnest, its ate It thing of be New Testament on that head Love as 1 rctUeu, says S "be pitiful, be courteous " Paul, to the Philip THIRDS toys,-" Let nothing be done through strife or vain For but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others buter than themselves ' Again, to the Romans hoses, Â« Be kindly offcctioned one another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one other " Once more 1 motor says - are, few of you, be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility Oh, how needful and important is forbear ince in regard to the views of others' Although the writer of these lines has never been remarked for his violence in spirit or action towards the opinions of his fellow Christians differing from him, yet, in looking back on a public career of thirty three years, he is sensible that on some occasions he could have been, with great ad vantage, more liberal minded, and more end urged in making allowances for sandy of mental vision on the same important subjects And in every aim at being " v allant for the truth we ought to propose to ourselves two questions very "variant for our guidance First What is the ra h the fundamental truth, or, it may be, thousand truth that is, the truth re- willing to be presently vindicated or for the time to be prominently exhibited And next, the inquiry, " What spirit are we of ? ' For, although we may be right as to the subject in debate, yet, if we are well in spirit, that is bitter and uncharitable, we cannot expect acceptance with God, or access to man, so as to gain others, and, by val mr for the truth, to prove it How needful, then, as well as how beautiful is charity' The perfect harmony that has prevailed in this Assembly ever since the Union in ISo encourages me to expect a continuance of the same commendable and Christian procedure And I am thankful to say that we have grounds to hope for still greater unanimity of sentiment But on this account alone now before,, me you think with themselves, what need then for these remarks I To such let me Bay without apology that I have penned the remarks that in this grace of 'brotherly love vo should abound more and more Finally, one above all, let money in a few sentences advert to the court in relation to our God in which we should set our selves to the work of the Assembly, and to the grind and which we ought over to have in view that end is God s era) in. which is the first branch of "man s chief and ' It is the chief end of angel as well as man, the chief end of all creation, At His glory we should aim with Single eye in all that we Co and determine in this place, pray erfully looking up for His guidance in everything And although the matters considered, and the business transacted here are not of such primary importance as the conversion and gather- ing in of souls to Christ (for this we regard as the great design and and function of the Church yet, as the queB lions which engage us, and are decided by us here, are such as can only be dealt with by us as a Church in General Synod, or ecclesiastical Parliament assembled, we ought, when thus met to regard them, and to attend to them, as the work of our God, just as in other circumstances we regard and obey His call to the Church'B>)ri mi j functions And although the business of the Assembly is not so con- tends] to some of us as preaching the Gospel and handle;,, the Word of God to our people, yet as it is an important part of God B work, and specific for the time and place, we ought not to shirk it, but to set ourselves to it honestly, humbleness so, acceptably though imperfectly, praying that the spirit of wisdom and understanding which rested on the Lord Jesus Christ, our glorious Head, without recourse, qualifying Him OF Mediator for His medy l tonal work, may rest on His faithful servants in measure great, rejoicing that "it hath pleased the rather that in him should all fulness dwell, that in Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, ' not one) in Him essential, OF God, but official for the behoof of the Church, as He is the Divine and only Head thereof, and the Mediator of the Covenant To Him, therefore, as the 1 serious Head of the Church, let us ever seek by prayer in filth to Him, as we are weak and erring servants at best, liable to the blind ng influences of prejudice and other o\ ills that beset us while engaged in the work of the Lord, let us look up for strength and guidance, whether occupied in our judicial or legislative capacity) in all matters coming before us whether by reference or appeal, for our revit w or decision, or by overture, for our consideration legislatively and for enactment, let us draw upon the treasures of wisdom and knowledge that are hid in our head and whether we are considering cases which involve soundness of doctrine, of which relate to the purity of church membership, or whether we are considering desired minor changes or adaptations (as they might call them) in the outward forms of worship or whether we are considering how we may extend and mature our Heathen Mission schemes, or how we may devise means for overtaking the neglected population of our towns-or how we may extend the Gospel and the means of grace to the more sparsely peopled districts of the colony \- or whether we are considering the necessity of industry Baring the young of our communion in scripture and " the form of sound words ' or taking measures for aiding the diffusion of the benefits of general education among the families of the land, whether we are setting yourselves to promote the better observance of the Sabbath-a proper function of the Church, or, in line, whether we are deliberating as to how we may best give the benefit of our counsel and influence as a Church to those who, as true patriots, are battling with the demon of intemperance In short, in all our deliberations and decisions, and practical efforts as a Church in the cause of truth and righteousness among men, and for the promotion of the Redeemer s kingdom in the world let us look up and plead " the promise of the father, which is the identical promise of the Son, viz the gift of the Holy Ghost, promised by our adorable Saviour in His farewell disCourse to His disciples promised by Him in three characters as " the spirit of truth," and the spirit of holiness, and the comforter as the spirit of truth to guide His church and people, as the spirit of holiness to sanctify thousand as the comforter to sustain and cheer them This was his best legacy to His church before his death, and His brightest promise after His resurrection Let us plead the promise annexed to His commission to His first ministers, when he sent them forth, saying, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature," when He said, "Go ye, therefore, and teach that is, disciple all nations, he added, and lo, I am with you always even unto the end of the world. Amen " As that some commission is ours, so the promise annexed is as firm and fresh to us as to them. Let us plead that perennial promise It is an everlasting promise, and has come down to us unmodified by descent Lo, I am with you always " Although His bodily presence was with drawn in a few days thereafter, and " the heavens must receive him till the times of the restitution of all things , ' jet is He present by His Spirit with His church and servants to the end of time When the promise of HIS Spirit is fulfilled, them the promise of His presence IS fulfilled His promised Spirit is the only true and proper Vicar of Christ in the world Oh, let us be earnest for His Spiritual presence in our Assembly, lot it not be to us amere nÃ­jÃ­raclioÃ­i, but a reality-a realised blessedness Let the consciousness of this presence by our blessed privilege, and operate on us in a way suited to every emergency of our cote, and every peculiarity of our circumstances Lot that presence sustain us in difficulties, illumine our minds and both in darkness, cheer us in despondency, dispelling the gloom, guard and fortify UB against temptation and solom nise us at all times as dealing with sacred things And not only while here in council, and in the changing society of one another, but amid the duties and trials of everyday ministerial and pastoral life, let us earnestly seek happily reoliBO, highly value, and humbly improve that gracious promised presence. And now, fathers and brethren, craving your indulgent acceptance of these rambling remarks, offered in form of address from the Moderator whom, unworthy your suffrages, you have, for the time, placed "Iramts enter pares," 1 conclude with the closing petition of the " Prayer of Moses, the man of God " -"And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us and establish Thou the work of our hands upon us the work of our hands establish Thou it "-Ps xc v 17. SECOND SEDERtNT-lho General Assembly met yesterday morning, the 20th instant, at 10 JO, and after prayer, proceeded to business The Rev JAMES CAMERON moved, that the thanks of the Assembly') be recorded to the Rev. Dr. Steel, for the very efficient manner in which he has discharged the duties of the Moderatorship since the lamented death of the late Moderator " The Rev Mr Cox TTS seconded the motion, which was put, and carried by a unanimous vote TÃIOMODEIIATOR conveyed the thanks of the Assembly to the Rev. Dr Steel, by whom the vote was suitably acknowledged RECE TION OF MINISTERS Reports from the Presbytery of Sydney were presented, from which it appeared that the Rev. A C Smith, the Rev. Thomas Blain, the Rev Robert Lewers, the Rev. A N Mackray, and the Rev. Colin M'Culloch had been received by the Presbytery of Sydney, subject, of course, to the approval of the General Assembly. After some discussion, for the most part, of a conversa- tional character, the reception of all these ministers was approved, and the Assembly also resolved that the Rev Messrs. Mackay and M'Culloch be invited to sit and deliberate in the Assembly during the present session. REVISION 01 PRESTON TERRY RECORDS The following committees were appointed to revise the presbytery records Messrs Cameron and Bain, for the Presbyterian records of Sydney , Messrs.

Â£8 Mr Niven was reappointed commissioner of the Presbytery of New England, with full powers to act as a member of that Presbytery, whensoever a quorum should remain, as heretofore, to be made up CHURCH SCHEMES-J UHHC MEETING The overture anent the propriety of holding a public meeting in support of the schemes of the Church was then called on, when At Rev R S ]PATEIlS0>, supported the proposition, showing the reasonableness of what was so suggested, and arguing that, by means of such a public meeting, a greater (T Â°lcro beneuclBl publicity might be given to projects of ..? extension, and a large amount of general interest to be awakened and secured, The Rev Dr Sun fully concurred in the views expressed by the Rev Mr Paterson the Rev Dr G zinc also sup ported the proposed meeting, and advocated the adoption of ton cement 1 plan at the annual meetings of that Assembly whereby public meetings of a popular character might, from time to time, be hold If this were to be done he did not doubt but that there would be a far more nun crops attendance of the 1 city, and, as a consequence, that fuller red one of the speech might be expected they had better make it a settled point to have those public meetings in connection with the sitting of the Asflcmbh, because then the proceedings would, doubtless, be invested with greater interest, and thus brought forward as prominently as meetings of a popular character always were The Rev gentleman went on to complain, in a bush rous and rather satiric ii manner, of the brevity of the newspaper reports of even the cleverest Speeches of Presbyterian clergymen, when they happened to have to speak in public on n alters having special reference to the affairs of their own Church He spoke feelingly, he said having been himself snuffed out at their public most inglast}Ctr The rev doctors comments on the short comings of the Press were made in a racy and pleasant strain and created much amusement amongst his clerical brethren After further discussion, a committee was appointed to make am agements FORMS 01 IDOCLIUltE The report of the Com mittee on Toons and Price who was called for, brought up, and read by the Rev. J B Laugh- ton, the conventÃ­ After deliberation, the final disposal of the question was postponed till to- morrow morning (the 21st instant), to one after the discussion of the report of the Widows an 1 Orphans Scheme the Assembly, at its rising, adjourned till 6 p m , closing its proceedings with player 1 hills) SIWIUNT - The Assembly met in the evening, pu suant to adjournment MISSIONS TO THE HEATHEN Called for report of Committee on Missions to Heathen, which was brought up and read by the Rev. John Kinross (of Kiama), the convener The Rev HE MR MCliEUiiE (of Braidwood), gave some important details concerning the Chinese evangelist, Philip Leo Hyung, at present labouring amongst his countrymen on the Araluen gold fights, and also at Little River and Jembaicumbene The Rev Dr STEEL (agent for the New Hebrides Mission, also gave some inter sting information as to the progress of missionary enterprise in those islands The following deliverance was moved by the Rev Dr STEEL -" That the report be received and approved, and the committee thanked for their services, and that, the General Assembly rejoices to hear of the auspicious com meneen cent of missionary work among the heathen by means of agents of the Church, and earnestly prays that the Divine blessing may rest upon the missionaries, and that the cause may be supported by the prayers and liberal way of our people Mr DAVID WAY OF (elder), seconded the motion, and in so doing warmly advocated the mission cause, express ing his hope that the Heathen Mission Committee would never lose sight of the Chinese in this country. He was very happy to find that their Church had already secured the services of a Chinese evangelist and hoped that the efforts now so worthily begun in this direction would be extended to a much wider field of usefulness in the mission field here extended before them all The Rev PATRICK FITZGERALD) (of Moruya) supported the motion before the court, and gave several interesting details of the missionary labours of the Chinese evangelist " Philip amongst his own countrymen in Nerrigundah Araluen, and elsewhere The rev gentleman described the earnest manner in which Philip had been seen by him preaching the Gospel to his countrymen engaged on the gold diggings in that portion of this colony Their even gets was, moreover, rapidly acquiring a competent knowledge of the English tongue, and would soon it was hoped be able to come to that Assembly and give them in person an account of the work in which he was engaged The Rev Mr GIEROV (of "mass) also supported the motion and gave an account of certain missionary efforts of an individual character, amongst the aboriginal natives of this colony The Rev Dr LANG C SIRO supported the motion, directing his remarks principally to the mission field disclosed by the melancholy state of the heathens in Melanesia, especially the black race in the New Hebrides group, on one of the islands of which their Church had one mission labouring at their sale charge- the Rev J D Gordon The motion was then put, and carried by a unanimous vote SAI HATH SCHOOLS Called for the report of the S sabbath School Committee Mr M A by-law, in the absence of the convenor, brought up the report At the desire of the Assembly, the report was read in extenso The Rev Dr GEH HE moved the adoption of the report In so doing the rev. gentleman declared his firm conviction that the buSiness of teaching in Sabbath schools was second only to the ministrations of the sanctuary By a strict attention to the working out of the Sabbath school system the influence of the clergyman over the young was to be widely founded and generally extended It was from these schools that the future communicants of their Church were to come and also that cordial co-operation which ministers required to encourage them in their incessant round of pastoral duty Fully persuaded as he was of all this, he had, for some years past constantly spent seven! hours every Sabbath afternoon in his Sabbath school, and he rejoiced to say he had been abundantly rewarded by the blessing which had there crowned his humble efforts the work of the missions to the heathen was, no doubt, a matter of grave in importance, but the work of Sabbath schools was a work that tended to double a minister's church congregation He respectfully suggested to the fathers and brethren that ministers should always visit and superintend their own Sabbath schools in the institution of Sabbath schools they had a power of doubling their personal influence over their flocks In saying this, he, of course, did not intend by any means, to imply that the influence of the Sabbath school teacher WIB ever to be substituted for the plain duty of parents to bring up their children in the nurture and fear of the Lord, that man must be a very ignorant man indeed who could ever suppose such a thing The Sabbath school was merely supplementary to the vigorous and conscientious discharge of the manifest duty of all Christian parents He urged also upon his reverend brethren the propriety of leach off the Sabbath school teachers themselves, so as to ensure the greatest and most beneficial amount of effi ciency He suggested the propriety of organising a Sabbath School Union throughout New South Wales Such a union of the Sabbath school teachers of the Presbyterian Church in the colony would naturally encourage every teacher in their noble labours amongst the young The Presbyterian Church had too often missed its opportunities in regard to their young people in the Sabbath schools They might not only retain their young people, but by giving them something to do, for and in the Church, utilise the individual and collective efforts of all in the cause of Christ Mr H STACK seconded the motion After some remarks by the Rev J B LAtoiiTON, the Rev R S PATERSON, and the Rev. Mr Gin-) v, in respect of the advisability of printing the report, for economical reasons, Mr HOSVAI I spoke to the motion, explaining some of the circumstances under which the report had been drawn up It must be deeply gratifying, indeed, to the Church to find that there were so in ray persons in their communion who give their services gratuitously to this most important work The Rev A C SMITH (assistant minister of the Scots Church, Jamison street), supported the motion, bearing glad testimony to the important evangelising influence of sabbath schools, and pointing out how labour, there expended, was often found to react upon the adults of a family, the younger members of which were thus led to take a vital interest in religion He earnestly deprecated the neglect of S sabbath school influence as frequently causing a defection from their ranks of children properly belonging to their communion He concurred in the view that a system of lessons should be devised both for the elder and the younger Sabbath school children. He suggested also the adoption of a plan whereby all the ministers of their Church might be directed to preach special sermons in relation to Sabbath schools The Rev Mr ><]XEN was also strongly in favour of special sermons being preached for Sabbath schools Mr D\x in WAUGH regretted that several ministers had not sent in returns of their Sabbath Schools The same thing had happened to a regretable extent) last year The Rev Mr MACREADY agreed in the remarks made by the preceding speaker Mr MAILLÃE, (elder) dissented from the opinion that some had expressed of placing the Sabbath schools immediately under the management of the kirk SOBSIOBS The Rev JOHN KIMIOM,, the Rev. ADAM THOMSON, the Rev Dr GEH IE, and Mr ROIIPHT M Curran offered a few closing remarks, after which the motion was put, and carried by a unanimous vote Leave was given by the Assembly for the Presbytery of Bathurst to meet for business on the next morning at half-past 9 o'clock The Assembly adjourned it 10 30, until the following day, at half-past 10 o dock
