SPORTING. A requisition is being presented to owners of horses engaged in the Adelaide Hunt Club Gap asking them to consent to allow The Trajan to start in that event. Through an oversight the horse was not accepted for on Friday, bat Sir- Hope Murray is anxious that he should ran. As the race is one which is looked upon more in the spirit of friendly rivalry than by the hard-and-fast rules which govern ordinary racing it is not anticipated that there will be any opposition on the part of owners to acceding to the request mfcde by Mr. Murray. The Master, Mr. F. H. Downer, was the first to sign the requisition. The-published report that Danbydale hud been destroyed proves to ba incorrect. The hone, however, is in a yery bad way, and is hardly likely to race again. Mr. John Crazier wrote to the Secretaries of the V.R.C. and VXT.C. on Friday last withdrawing his horses from all their engagements. The two-year-old Taliesin has been added to tile list of geldings. In the Seoond Steeplechase at the A.J.C. Meeting all tha starters fell with the exception of the winner, Redden. Bushman was remounted and plaoed seoond.. Toreador finished second to Tire in the Bandwiok Plate, but was disqualified because Us rider coold not pull the weight. Newman aooordingly reoeived second money and Gozoctar third. By the steamer Argus, which left Port Adelaide on Saturday for Calcutta via Melbourne, a luge shipment of hones was sent to India on behalf of Mr. George Clark, who is well known among horsedealers, having for some time been connected with Messrs. Ralli and Co., and later with Messrs. Hill & Co. The consignment altogether amounted to 115 bead of horses, and included thoroughbreds, carriage horses, racing ponies, tad remonbts. Among - the racehorses wfaifh were placed on board at the Port were Principle'and Blodwen, both of whom have carried Mr. David James's colours on the South Australian turf. The animals were walked on board the steamer along a race, and although sonie proved very fractious the lot were eventual^ B»fely enaconsed in their stalls in one of the lower holds and in the 'tween decka..: The Argus is to oall at Melbourne on the voyage to Calcutta, and will take in another lot n£275 horses. This will bring the number on board up to 390, which will make her* full slup. The. 'Sydney correspondent of the Rajitter telegraphed .yesterday that in the billiard match ot 6,000 up played between C. Memmott and H. Gray tne latter on Friday evening made1.062in a break through getting the balls jammed in the .corner pocket. We'have reoeived from Mr. J. H. Smith a copy of the Western Australian Racing Calendar for September. Mr. Power, who went to England to bring out Mr. 8. Hordern's latest importations, spent, aome time there in inspecting studs, amd, aooording to' "Terlinga, of the Auttrato«an, he saw a good deal of racing under advantageous «ircnmstanoes. The Xhike of Portland's stud is not come-at-able by every one, but Mr. Power saps the Duke is only too glad to let Australians have a look over it, and Mr. Power, of. course, went to Welbeck andsaw. Carbine. ; The old fellow wm looking remarkably well — quite as fat, in fact, as when at Lerderderg, and this notwithstanding that he is ridden regularly. The Duke has a great idea of Carbine's future as a staJlipn, . a0(f: i6 "giving, bita every ohatiee. When. Malum ft reached England she was very poor and looked so small that the gentleman who had bought her as a speculation for 1,000 guineas determined to get out of her. Mn. Lang try then bought tne Newmarket winner for 1,300 guineas, and Mr. Power knows that the Jersey ialf has since refused 2,600 guineas for the little mare. When last Mr. Power saw her Malttma was running in a small paddock at. .the rear of her trainer's house, aoshe is hardly likely to do much racing this season. Mrs. Langtry takes a great interest in both racing - and breeding. She nearly, always goes to see her horses run (often sees them work), and can talk ^pedigree with the Special Commissioner (Mr. Allison, who bought Malnma from Mr. Bedfern), so thoroughly has she. mastered the studbook. Mr. Power mis a very long time in making np his mind about a sire. As stated in the papem, he did think of Florizel IL, but only np to tie time'Lord Marcus Beresford talked 16,1)00 guineas as the price. Afterwards the Pnnoejs manager came down to 12,000guineas, but even-at thisfigure Mr. Power did not feel disposed to negotiate.' At one time Simoman, i horse of Colonel North's, was Mr. Power's Americans'the best' people to follow when racing. When Wishard fancied one of his it naariy always won. La Fleche, Mr. Power says^ is not small, but a very fine mare. Best Man, ^though be only stands 15.1, is one of the best horses he saw. Nearly all tiie St. Simon horses are all fire and excitability. Hie only really quiet one Mr. Power met with was Persimmon. St. Frusquin was always in a lather by the time he readied the post, "but, despite this, he was all there when it came to racing, amd Mr. Power thinks his defeat in the Derby a fluke. A roeisti g of th&oommittee; of the Cockbam Tt»omg dub -was held on Friday, September 18, Mr. Jobh Penrose, the Mayor of SQverton, presiding. It was resolved to hold a race meetmgbn Wednesday, November25, and to give away £110 in stakes, the principal event to be of the value of £35. Several prominent horsoownera in Adelaide have ptomised to nominate horses in order to give the new club a good start. Apoet-mortem examination made of Malua showed that his diaphragm was extensively ruptured.. The aorta was also ruptured, and the hemorrhage from this was the immediate cause of death.," , . Conjecture's foal to Malua died on the same day that the death of his sire was reported. PORT ADELAIDE SPRING MEETING. S&TOBDAY;, SEPTEMBER 19. Stewards—Messrs. -C. Tucker, John Pile, H. A.
