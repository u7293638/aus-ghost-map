The perfect weather had yesterday would have attracted a large number of towns- people to S ircll races had the holiday been a general one, the falling-off. in the usual metropolitan representation being due to this fact. If the town patronage was' lessened, there was rather an increase in the local contingent, the spectators on the 'course numbering between 900 and 1,000 As is customary, the pleasant drive to Sorell was undertaken by most of the visitors this Belle of the Derwent, only about 100 persons taking advantage of the ride' by rail which was placed at the' disposal of excursionists by Mr. R. C. Patterson, the contractor for the Sorell line of railway. At a few minutes past IL the train started from Bo leave for its destination, composed of four carriages, on open truck, and guard's van, reaching Sorell's distance of 143 miles in (53min., including stoppages. The train ran smoothly, and the ride was' much enjoyed by the party, which included Hon. A. T. Pillinger (Minister of Rail way s), and the two members of the district (Messrs. H v Lamb and C E. Featherstone). One or two minor improvements had been effected to the course since last meet such as a new judge's box, and the widening of the steeplechase jumps, A top- dressing of auld pub the running ground in a condition that precluded the possibility of complaint The sum of £1,244 was put through Francis and Ryan's machine during, the afternoon, an increase of nearly £200 over the last annual meeting. A musical programme was supplied by the Pembroke Band, the members of which dis- coursed simple lines with precision.

The' Hurdle Race initiated the programme of seven < vents ; four horses a weighed out, with Sterling a red-hot fa vom Pte.

Seven started for the Trial Stakes, 6 solicit turned out, as anticipated, a fairly easy thing for Clynton. Only the red of the half-dozen numbered on the card, for the Sorell Plate contested the event, and so great a " moral" in perspective was it for Ringarooma that the books wanted 3's and 4's on before they would write her name, at the same time more ready to lay the odds against her two opponents. Swinton never gave either of his antagonists the ghost of a show, winning another of those runaway are so characteristic of his victories. The favourites must have stripped far from her best, as, assuming who could not stay out the distance two miles less 10 chains-she won have made it merry for a circuit or so.
