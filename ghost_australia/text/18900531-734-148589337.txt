S UP EBSTITIOXS—HINDOO AND ENGLISH. .The following stories of superstitions 1 are told by 11 E.A.K, ' describing in Temple Bar the 11 Ways of the East." —One day an English magistrate was paying a visit to a Hindoo gentleman, who was an old friend of his, in the course of which he happened to yawn ; to his astonishment up jumped the Rajah as if galvanised, and began furiously snapping his fingers in startl ing proximity to his face. Observing his visitor's look of unfeigned surprise, he explained that this was done to scare away the devils who might otherwise seize the opportunity to jump down his throat. How strange it seems to us this practical belief in devils, and fear of them, combined with so insultingly low an idea of their intel ligence and power ! I once heard, how ever, an odd instance of the same fear and yet contempt for unseen powers shown byr an English lady in the be ginning of this century—a Bishop's wife too !—who was afraid of ghosts, and if left alone in the house would whistle as she walked through the passages at night in order that the ghosts might take her for a man.
