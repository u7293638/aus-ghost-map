REINSTATING AN EVICTED TENANT. A correspondent of the Wexford writes as follows :— People Before the palmy days of the Land League the late Samuel Johnson, landlord, of Rosetowri, sought an inorease of rents from the tenants. James Murphy, a struggling farmer, with a large family, rented a small farm at Rosetown from' Mr. Johnson, at the rent of £12 13s. 6d., the valuation being £10 10a. Murphy, considering that the farm was rather a poor one, strove without complaining to P«y his way at the rental, but when an additional burthen was placed upon him In having the rent nlsed to £17 10s. Jbe found that his lot wasbopelees.aodlhat wner or latei;he 8hould give up In despair. ttemoDstrasoes .with the landlord : w» unavailing, and in 1881 the unfortunate tenant gave up the ghost on ejectment PPoceedlngs being taken against him. ttufrnp, tothepresent his family worked with the neighbouring ! farmers in order to supply themselves ; with the means of subsistence, but the little farm remained untenanted, except for a brief term, as no one would take It under the circumstances.
