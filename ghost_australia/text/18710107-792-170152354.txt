INTERCOLONIAL. NEW SOUTH WALES. CHRISTMAS AND MR. PARKES. The Flaneur in the Sydney Empire thus writes about these two celebrated characters :— I am full of Christmas. Even the literary duel, which I think threatens to grow into fisti- cuffs, between Messrs. Forster and Parkes, loses its interest for the time; and that long list of confiding creditors who appear to have had a just appreciation of disinterested patriotism is almost banished from memory for the nonce — but not quite though. Was ever there such a specimen of ingenuity in financial operations? By Jove, Sir, you have found your Treasurer at last. That's the man to raise the wind in our empty Treasury! Forget him, indeed! Oh no! I can fancy some of the credulous ones whose names figure in the list, and who don't quite forget the Kiama mystery yet, replying to a similar question in the precise words of Hamlet to his father's spirit :— Remember thee? Aye, thou POOR "Ghost," while memory holds a seat In this distracted brain! I have not a very bad opinion of my compa- triots, but must confess that I never before be- lieved that there was so much genuine benevo- lence in the country. Why, the victims seem to have bled literally like calves. Talk of "the butcher, the baker, the candlestick- maker"— this list completely eclipses that famous assem- blage of industrious tradesmen. Here we have wine-merchants, printers, lawyers, newspaper proprietors, member of Parliament galore (ten belonging to one House an three to the other!) squatters, anti- squatters, Catholics. Protestants, Jews, University professors, banks, aldermen, chemists, grocers, agents, brewers, boot-makers, butchers, auctioneers, drapers, stationers, Go- vernment officials — oh! the list swclls into pro.=- portions so enormous that the imagination can hardly grasp it; and I stand-rapt, amazed, and dazzled at the genius which could thus effectually mesmerise so vast and varied a throng!
