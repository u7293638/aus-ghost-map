THE TURF. GAWLER JOCKEY CLUB RACES. A SUCCESSFUL WINTER MEETING. CUP WON BY PRINCIPLE. THE STEEPLECHASE BY JULIET. The Gawler Jockey Club comes into the category of racing institutions who have this reason been favored with magnificent weather for their autumn and winter fixtures. The course at Evantton, although laid out on the "other way round" principle as at Bandwick, is one of the most compact, if not the prettiest in the colony. It is owned by Me Wo. Bladder and leased to the Gawler Jockey Club, whilst the training stables on the estate lias had various occupants from the time of Mr. Jenkins, -who brought to Adelaide one of two notable winners in the old days. It was the firm of Bladder and. Ferry who built the grand stand and made the original enclosures, and for a time it was a very uphill fight with the Gawler Club to hold its existence much leas to Boorish and find favor with all classes. Times have changed, however, and the use of the totali zator bis virtually placed the club on a sound fim?r?-i*l footing while the in dustrial prosperity of Gawler as an engineer ing centra jmtnrithn*aTi/?imr^||p strike teoubles, has settled within the South Australian Athens i permanent and pleasure-loving as* well as a ?[ever and industrious community. When me arrives at Gawler. and notes that the rail way engines which conveyed the tourists thither were made by Martin k Co^ and the Gist thing that stops their way on emerging: from the station is an immense tKffter labelled ** Martin jc C0.," and destined for the Joker Mining Company, somewhere in West Australia, the "visitor is mi-Hnnrl %o ask who these jokers are, Martin & Go^ and are soon told, they should visit the local foundries to £na out, IwransH May t Co. and others are also busy in the production of joining machinery for the West. It would only be a 'tothersider, however, from the back blocks who had not already got an historical know- Jedge.of these firms, and one of the jmostgrati ing features of the race meeting was to see their leading members on die ground, the Hon. J. Martin carrying his many years of notable service with a jaunty air, as though there had bees no recent troubles over the labor ques tion. To endeavor tp distinguish those who were present from those were absent amongst the local residents would be a task we'd feil to fulfil, so it need only be said that all the leading families were represented, liy the ladies as well as die male members of i;ie house. Officially it must be noted that the chairman of the dob (Mr. W. Robertson) and Mr.-. Robertson, of Turretfield, were unavoidably absent, but being such long founded and worthy residents of the district their absence on their Queensland station was understood while regretted, and it was left to Mr. Harper, their youthful relative of some SO cummers, to represent them, which be did in his ' usnal gay and buoyant fashion, a favorite always with "the sex." Mr. John Pile and family were also unavoid ably absent through the opening of the hunt ing eesson a£ Ketherby, but there was a good muster of (he local committee and stewards, and with the aid of Mr. Buckingham, the sec retary, the day's proceedings were carried out in a manner that reflected credit on all con cerned, as thore was not a noticeable bitch Anywhere. Since last season the Derby stand has been enlarged, an improvement vhice gave great satisfaction, and judging" by tike attendance on Saturday further extensions of Beating accommodation will have to be made by-and-by. The two special trains that went up from the city were crowded, and if a rough platform could be made for landing at t"*? racecourse itself the bo an would he appreciated. The weather was all that could be desired and the ground in good going condition, although a bit heavy along the back of the racing track. The totalizator, which was well managed by Mr. J. Lynch, put up a record for Gawler, as £5,380 passed through, in compariison with £4.030 last year. The tote was a half-sovereign one, and the dividends given below relate to pound investments. A great number of ladies were present out of a total of four to five thousand .spectators, and the fair sex appre ciated their afternoon tea and the strains of Kay's Model Brass Band, who performed the following selections during the intervals:— March, "Antipodes" (T. E. Bulch); schpfc-. tische, "Gay and festive" (Eugene Rose); Irish overture, "Humors of Donnybrook" (Cad Voltag); quadrille, ?? Phonograph" (T. E. Bulch); fajitawa. "Memories of Scotland" (IS." Newton); schottiache, "Jolly sailors" (T. E. Buleb); march; "Sever behind" (J. Jubb); waltz, "Lore's messenger" (H. Bound); polka, "Easy bee" {H. Bound): waltz, "Parting kiss" (X. H Wright); galop (May); God save the Queen. The catering was well dona by Sir. Charles Addison, who pro vided an excellent luncheon. The racing was of the usual Gawler character, a bit the wrong way 'iprand for backers of favorites, '#6& " the : tote7 . agents had { the boat of their' customers on this occasion, as non-favprites "oupeboinp in eyary race but one. The.opening-.eyeat waa the -Hurdles, with eight startais and Arctic favorite, bat he i died away, in the straight, and Mr.'Melroae's Radiant won from Sir George and Gipsy Queen.. The winner is a fine strapping horse who should make a first-class jumper. * "He had picked up a nail two days faef ore-tbe race, and went ont dotty, finishing, decidedly lame, but he came home like a racehorse, and ire would be pleased to know that his owner had found sind was racing a dozen 'nmre like him. For the Hying Handicap Pitchery was the only absentee, and eight starters went out; with Bernice as favorite. This filly, however, seems to have a. knack of regarding her first event on tbo card as a trial spurt, and she failed to get home, but won the last race of the day in a canter, as she has done on one if not two occasions. Mr. Purvis scored a win with Wrangler, and deserved it, as ho told bis friends previous to the race that] lie thought he could win, Mr. Mallen was equally outspoken about Bosedale, but his boy was shepherding Alveary when he thought ho bad the race won, and Hodgkins on Wrangler slipped npon the inside and an nexe! tlis btake. Nomadic, who had been backed by a. few "on the otf-chance.'' was seen to Ije battling with his rider at the start, and although they got on terms in the straight and the KTey came with a fast run too late, the ete .Yards were not satisfied with the performance and Quinn was **MVff before them. His explanation and that of the owner, Mr. Wigley, was re ceived, but the stewards did their duty in hold iuc an enquiry, however agreeable the*'ex-' planation" may have been to those who backed the hors". for the Steeplechase again there were eight runners, with Mailboy and Reck l.'SK strong favorites. The consistent Juliet, however, turned up a winner, having more foot than Jlaiihoy in the run home. Young Lucifer rau oif at tiic first fence, taking Cata ract and Confidence with him, and Kir Georg? fell. The Ghost was scratched in consequence of meeting with an injury while being sent from Broken llill by train, and he oould fret no further than Kapunda, where he remains in Host Murphy's stables. Eight was again the main for the Gawler Cup, with Tinstream a better tavorite than Nackara, but both were beaten by Mr. D. James's Principle, Nackara, and Mompa securing the positions. This was a fine race and afforded an exciting finish. The Trial Stakes, with half adozen starters, was called in the pwdiork tie Danbydale stakes, and the odds-on favorite had no difficulty in annex ing first position from Wahine and Germaine. The Evanston Jlandicap produced the largest field of the day, 14 runners, with Bosedale the actual favorite. There was. a bungling start and Bemice getting well away never left axe issue in doubt, wmninjrin a canter from 'Barn side and Bosedale. The afternoon's racing was concluded in good time and *?illi but little delay' to complain of. The excur sionists found their seats in the specials and were landed back in Adelaide in good time for the evening amusements. Stewards, W. Bobertson, S. J. Jacobs, J. Pile, W. Gilbert. S.

Badiant came borne very strongly, winning by a length from Sir George, who supplanted Gipsy Queen for second position, the latter being four lengths away.

Bosedale appeared to be winning comfortably, her rider, Bourke, glancing over his shoulder and .shepherding Alveary, but did not notice Wrangler, who was brought up smartly on the inside by Hodgkins and landed a winner by a length, a neck separating Rose dale from Alveary, with Bernice and Wahine in near *J*^p^g.Tn*>, then Fortunate and the other two.
