NOTES. The Midland Counties team1 in the present match is a strong ono, in spite of the absenco of Shrewsbury, Gunn, Chattel-ton, and one or two others. But presumably some ot these aro taking part in tho match between the Gentlemen and Players at Lords. It Is a matter for surprise that LUlcy is not playing lu that match. Tho players to whom most Interest will attach on this occasion aro tho Worcestershire professionals, Arnold and Wilson. The county has this year been promoted to first-class rank, and the batting of Arnold, who was previously unknown to fame, has been qutto sensational. Indeed, a newspaper In by tho last mail earnestly advocates Ills in clusion In tho test matches. Ho is also an ex cellent bowler, of medium pace. Wilson has also rapidly como to tho front, and on occasion his success has bccu extraordinary. LUlywhite de scribes him as a "good fast howler, faster than ho appears to be; fearless bat, but wants coach ing." Ono of tho six defeats sustained by the 1890 Australian team was at tho hands of tho Midland Counties, and Hulme, who is taking part In this engagement, had much to do with tho result. In the first Innings of the visitors (who wero eventu ally beaten by four wickets) he took six wickets for 54 runs, and In the second four for 69. lie is a left-hand howler, and a bard-hlttlug bat. Ho did not play In the recent match between Derby shire and the Australians. Other members of 'lie victorious team ot three years ago who are playing 011 this occasion are Jones and Lilley. Quaife is doubtful. William Qualfo played lu the earlier match; but the cablo does not make It clear whether he or his brother Waltor Is playing in tills fixture. Champain Is the Oxford University captain, who scored 120 against tho Australians a mouth or two ago, aud Jessop — who, It will be remembered, took part In tho second tost match— Is tho Cam bridge University captain, and a great hitter. W. M. Bradley, who is cabled as a candidate tor a placo la the forthcoming tost match, is an amateur, and ho plays for Kent. After tho first test match, the English papers suggested his In clusion In subsequent engagements. Ho Is a good, fast bowler, but a -poor bat. Meanwhile, Richardson, Lockwood, and Mold seem to be en tirely out of It, and as for Kortrigbt, of Essex, ho has not been able to play this .season in con sequence of "Ill-health. Tho following are the batting and bowling averages of the Australians, calculated up to tho beginning of tho present match. It will be seen that Noblo loads the batting as regards both aggregate and average. BATTING. «I . .1 I .

All the wickets have been accounted for, but not all the runs. Last mouth Notts iu ono day ran up 438 for the loss of two wictccts. A.. O. Jones, who is playing for the Midland Counties, made 250, and Shrews bury 146. "Jones" (says the "Daily Mall") "eclipsed aJl his previous batting achievements yesterday, when £01 Notts against Gloucester shire ho compiled tho huge score of 250. His display was brilliant in the extreme, aud until his total was close upon 200 ho did not make a mistake. The Gloucestershire bowling was played with ridiculous case, and there was not a single weak point in the amateur's attack. His driving was hard and clean, his cutting was beautifully crisp and well-timed, and his leg-play quite above reproach. It is needless to add that he received an ovation after terminating his stay of four and a half hours. Mr. Jones' previous highest score for Notts was 161 against Leicester shire three years ago. Shrewsbury also played with all his old-time skill, and in four hours and a half he assisted Mr. Jones to run up the score of 391, which should of itself be sufficient to ensure them against defeat This' partnership is a record one for Notts for tho llrst wicket, but longer stands have, of course, been made in matches betweeu other counties." Speaking of the first test match and Ranjit- sinhji, our London correspondent says: — "That he formed one of the home team was due to Dr. Grace's persistence, for on being Invited to tako a bat for England's sake, Ranji, 'tis said, wrote refusing on the grounds that he wasn't playing in very good form, and that thero wero other men with equally good claims to inclusion. To this modest note Grace replied tersely by tele gram, 'Don't be a fool, but come aud play for us.' That ho secured Ranji may be some con solation to the doctor for bis own failure with the bat and ball in the match. Tbe best thing 'W.G.' did in the course of the match was iu securing Iiill in the Australian second innings. Clem had been playing beautiful cricket, and with SO to his name seemed likely to stay at the crease all day. He cut a bail from Jackson hard, and everybody looked for a boundary, but Grace shot his big right hand outward and earthwards, aud made the most brilliant catch of the match — a catch which everybody said was 'hard lines on Hill.' The young South Australian player got a big reception on his return to tbe pavilion, and it must have been a great satisfaction to him to have been able to make amends for bis test match failures of 1896. His innings was, so far as I coulcl see, without blemish. He well de served the plaudits of the Trent Bridge crowd." Immediately following his 93 not out in the first test match, Ranjitsinhji made 120 for Sussex against Middlesex, among the bowlers being Hearne, Trott, and Roche. Fry made 72 In the same innings. In very marked contrast to their tedious dis play in the test match at Nottingham was the play of the Australians at Lords against one of tho . strongest teams the Marylebonc Club can put into the field (writes our London corres pondent on June 9). In dismissing the aide cap tained by Dr. Grace for 245 runs, on a wicket well- nigh perfect, the Australians did very well indeed, and Jones is to be congratulated on getting five wickets for 72 on such a pitch. The feature of the Australians' first venture with the bat was the display of the two South Australian batsmen, Darling and Hill, who, becoming asso ciated after Ircdale's wicket had fallen, with the board showing 1 for 1, addod 40 runs in a quarter of an hour, and cansed the century to be hoisted 67 minutes after commencement of play. Both men played superb cricket, taking no risks and giving no chances, and at the end of Monday's play they were still together. Darling having 60 and Hill 50 to his credit. On Tuesday the twain kept up their form, but with his score at 71 and the total at 130, Darling fell to a splendid ball from Hearne. His score included 11 fours, a couple of threes, and two twos. Hill and Worrall— the latter swiped away merrily for 2S— took the score quickly to 177, and it was not until 27S was on the board that the young South Australian's career was brought to a close by a brilliant catch iu tho slips by Hearne off W.G. Hill's display was voted on all bands "splendid." He had subscribed in all 132 runs in four hours. I-Te scored a 5 (one for over throw, 14 fours, seven threes, and three twos. Barring a ghost of a chance to Board at the wicket when 19, his innings was without blemish. On Monday morning, by the way, Trumble strained himself in tho chest, and deeming it unwise to risk exertion in the field, was re placed by Laver for the rest of the English in nings.
