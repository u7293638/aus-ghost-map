Swindle.—A swindle recently detected is conducted as follows: A cheque, s*y for ten guineas, is obtained from /»ilrp witur at a bank, and ft blank cheque cxictlv like the filled-in cheqnc is secured. Tne two cheques are laid one upon the other so that the edges are exactly even. Both cheques are tlien torn irregularly acfoss, and lit ■such .1 way that tbe signature on the filled cheque appears on one piece and the amount and name of the payee on the other. The chcquis having been held together while torn, of course one piece of the blank cheque will exactly fit the other piece of the filled cheque. The swindler then flill in one piece of the blank cheque with the name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, say iinc thousand pounds, takes it with the piece of genuine cheque containing the sig nature of the bank, and explains that the cheque was accidentally torn. The teller can put the pieces together, and as they fit cxactlv, the chances arc that he will think the pieces arc parts of the same cheque, and bccnmc a victim to the swindle. The trick, of course, suggests its own remedy. The teller should refute to pay any cheque that is mutilati il.
