Harry's death ; and when Olwen saw him, she didn't for some weeks appear to even recognise him. She spoke F of Ali as "the good .black man," and of Seeta-as that dear girl;" out otherwise she never seemed to recall anything personal at all about them. For Harry she never eyen asked, and no one dared to mention his name before her. It seemed- as though the shock of that awful revelation, sweeping through f her like lightning, had wholly altered and obliterated a vast tract in her brain, the entire tract that dealt with Harry and with her memory of everything that had happened to them both since she first knew him. No wonder it was so. The Harry she had once known and loved, indeed, had disappeared utterly as though he was not.; and his disappearance, in the gulf, of ,that,horrible discovery, had blottedi out the entire consciousness of all that had fever in any way related to him. In place liad arisen a vague and' terrible;, shrinking dread,; .„a dreail that grew like a mushroom in her; brain ; an unfailing horror of being left alone in the rooms'"where she had lived with him and Wad heard his forgotten confession."
