OlilOINAL CORRESPONDENCE. THE FORTHCOMING REGATTA. (Jo the Editor of the Maitland Mercura.) SIR-1 felt great pleasure, and I am sure the residents of tho distriot experienced the same gratification, on perusing the programme issued by the Maitland regatta committee, bnt no doubt there were a few disappointed (especially below Hinton) I myself do not agree entiroly with the programme, on the whole, 1 think it reflBots great oredit on the oommittee-an amateur one too-and deserving the thanks of the in- habitants of Maitland I am fully aware of the difficulties to be overcome in drawing upa pro0riinme-a programme to Butt the majority, of course-and 1 hope the publio mil not be too severe in their crittoiem, but deal justly and impartially, and I am sure the rotuli will be found complimentary to the oommittee And now for my objections The tooth raoe (four oars, in any boats) must surely bo a blunder, or, rather, an oversight How is it possible to get ti reo or four boats of equal mont in a place like Maitland, or even on the Hunter, to enter for this race? lhe consequence will be that it must fall through, or otherwise great dissatisfaction and probable disgust will be displayed hy pullers of inferior boats The idea of any boats being allowed to enter foi a raoe of this kind IB absurd. Why not substituto a gig race at once' By increasing the prize to say £15, I am confident tbero would be a numerous stream ot competitors I have observed boats of the racing »kill genus in Newoastle and elsewhero modelled rather ir&ngibly;, osrtninly-well able to carry f ur, provided they are middling pullers, in fact, any boat oan be manned with four mon with a Blight altera- tion I have no doubt that in the race abovo-mentioiied the boats will bo of very unequal construction, notwith- standing the conditions imposed by the rules, und nomo of the oro«s will not ha\o the ghost of a chance of winning I really did think thal, Irom the faot of last year's experi- ence, wo should not have a repetition of those annoying Jauxpas wluoh oharootensod a number of the races rendering the regatta a mediocre offiir I hope the committee will make some amendment, if only in this raco, so as to enable some of our n quat io aspirants to compote with fair hope of suooess Surely they ooul 1 spioiry a certain class of boat, thereby preventing great annoyance nnJ perhaps expense Aocordingtotbeuording of the raoe (the tenth) any boat may enter, but it is optional with the oommittee whethei they return the entrance money or not tor the credit of tho town I think the oommittee might very well have dispensed with that rule, and guen simo encouragement to introduce boats ot superior build, and moreoompotitors Being adisintoreBtod party my only motivo in writing those few lines is with a view of oreating grcnter interest, and rendering the regatta successful in every way lu conclusion, 1 would respeoifully suggest u raco for amateurs in raomg skids, who have nevir won an advertised prize, open to all ouuiorB This I think, would ensure a great number of entrances, and ink til a spirit of emulation m our young men about Maitland -Trusting Ihavouot trespassed loo tar on your valuable columns, 1 beg to remain yours, DINGY.
