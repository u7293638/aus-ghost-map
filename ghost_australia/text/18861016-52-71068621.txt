Victoria Amateur Turf Club HaeGSíj . (FJIOM "CABriAH.") ,: FiRST.JDAT-SATüKDAYr OCTOBKIl 0, Th« opening or Gúmena Dar of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club races waa not allowed to pass over without tho usual rainy weather. Although tho weather was clear during the earlier portion of tho day, leading many to believe that tho rain would hold off, a sharp thunder-shower foll boforo tho first event. Still the attendance waa. in no manner affected thereby. Tho committee and its able socrotary. Mr. N. R. Bond, aro to be complimented on the excellence of their arrange ments. The showers made tho course very heavy. Tho Hunters' Cup produced the usual number of falls, but 110 serious mishap occurred to mar the sport of tho day. Tho racing began with twenty faoing tho starter for tho Maldon Plato, which provided a good finish be tween tho favorites Highland Chief and Newnmster, terminating in favor of the latter, a son of Newminstor, which won nicely. Nothing would go down with tho nublie in tho Hurdle Eaco but Corrigan's mount, Hunts man, which won easily. Thirteen faced tho-flag in thoGroat Pool Stakes, for which the Now South Wales colt Yetman was installed favorite The South Australian filly, Hortense, which is owned by Mr. C. L. Macdonald, came next in point of price. The start was all in favor of Hortense, and settling down to her work boforo the others, she established a clear three ' lengths lead, which she hold till tho end. Yetman carno fat>t and gamely, and managed to inako . a dead heat tor second placo, with tho other Adelaide filly. Perhaps. Tho romaimug members of tho New South "Wales contingent ran very indifferently. Sumatra came in sixth. The candidates for tho Guineas next carno on for con sideration. Volcano, who was favorite, looked bettor than when running in Sydney, and showed fresh and muscular. Maddolina also looked lit and well,andalthough Mr. Long's filly is well known to possoss very erratic racing habits, still there w'ero not wanting plenty to back her. My own j particular fancy, as ho walked about the paddock, was First Consul, a great big strapping colt something like First Chester on first acquaintance, but on shorter legs. His victory for the Baron of Rupertswood I would have proved vory popular. Blairgowrie appoared well, ana Chesham improvod. Gadfly is a long, low filly; ; but appeared rather light in musole. Maddolina caused some delay at tho start. When onco sot racing Cheahatn took charge of affairs, while Volcano was always noar alongside. Half a milo from, homo shouts wont up that Maddolina was coming, and, sure enough, she headed her Held and swung round the home turn clear of Volcano. Thon began the struggle The favorite was pushed to got up by the rails, but without avail, and suuorod a half-length defeat. First Consul, which had been xunninir wide of his field all the lourney, carno with an ill-timed ruBb, and was only beaten by a head for second honors. Had Power mado his run earlier, the son of Gang Forward must have won. It appears that tho colt hung out all tho way. Tho Austra lian Hunters' Cup was run through a blinding Bhowor of rain, which effectually prevonted any clear view of tho race. Union, with Mr. M'Culloch up, the gentleman who usually steers. Lady . Ashton, was selocted favorite ; while Lara, with Mr.. C. Filgato in tho | saddle, and old Abdallah, with Mr. Goo. GlasBCock as pilot, wero generally voted "good goods." Aa boforo montionod, a number of foils occurred. The race at the turn into the straight looked a certainty for Union, until Mr. In gi i a came with a run on the well-conditioned Goldfindor, and, won easily. In tho Toorak Handicap, Hogmanay, Middle- I march, Huron and Chuckster in tho order named, were] general selections. ' Tho rosult proved tho general correct- j ness of the public opinion, as Middlcmarch, a cast off from | Mr. James Whito's stable, just got home before Rick , worth and Hogmanay. Eosults:- ; .
