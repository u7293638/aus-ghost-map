THE POETRY OF THE SEARCH LIGHT. (snow Cassell s Tamitv McOrist ) The advantages or disadvantages of the I search-light in the dread event of war belong most decidedly' to the ultra proanto side of its character Whatever effect is produced by the light on observers on the shore is cir timely not lessened when the search light is brought to bear upon observers at sea I read how near or far none of us on the ship not do more than guess; abeam of light shoots hither and thither over the dark surface of the ocean Suddenly the beam is lost, and in place of it we see a bright and blazing star And then all the air is filled with a blinding light, apparently circling round and round, and forming a partially direct to the star from which it comes. It is only for a moment. As suddenly as it came upon us it has gone, and we feel that even at sea, where night can be dark, we have never known before what darkness meant. Probably our ship is one of a squadron, and is fitted, like her consorts and the vessel whose light has broken so mysteriously upon our darkness, with a search- light of her own This will be quickly brought into play, and its beams in their turn will dart hither and thither across the dark waters in search of the ship from which the strange light flashed. In this progress the beams will cross and recross the lights of other ships, and will show at one minute chillingly opaque and the next as a transparent film Every eye is turned to the quarter whence the first light flashed upon us If the light come from a torpedo boat and fortune favour us we shall sight the boat in a few minutes, but it may be an hour or even more before we do so, for her commander, if he wished to escape detection, would naturally avoid the direct path of the light from his ship But, sooner or later, telling blue black against the light beyond her, we catch sight of the low lying boat, which is passing through a beam and is speeding towards us Now, in time of war, would be the "psychological moment" for the guns But we are anxious only to keep the on coming boat under observation She is travelling fast, and we have to shift the light rapidly. Once again the beam hats upon the water, but it catches only the stern of the stranger, making it tell as light grey against dark Nearer and nearer hastens the boat, starting this way and that in a vain endeavour to elude the blinding ni) of ghost!) light which follows her relentlessly. The w weird mystery deepens us the space between us grows less, and distance, form, and colour are distorted and lost As often as not we see from behind the left the boat which it is covering, as though it were travelling in the air or upon the bulwarks of our own ship Weird and startling as is this effect, it is far surpassed by that which is given by the search light when it throws as it often does, huge shadows on the sky Not every state of the atmosphere is favourable to this phenomenon 1 og or smoke must be present in the air, which will then being made opaque or semi op ique, take the imprint of a shadow almost as surely as a blank wall on shore just in the same way one often sees on the water, when the sun is shining the sharp shadow of the ship formed where there is team, though, as a rule the water, being as transparent as these, will not take a shadow. The same thing takes place with the search- light only the heat being so much nearer to the object than are the clouds upon which the Below is thrown, the shadow often appears many times larger than the ondina!, and a tiny boat will have a shadow moving along the clouds like a gigantic ghost ship Justos shell to) be answered b) shell, and a torpedo attack be returned in kind, so may Hash be responded to by Hash, and beam meet beam In warfare the search light should prove very useful in keeping under observation an attacking boat, and one's first thought is she would inevitably) serve as a splendid perfect for guns fired from behind the light But what if the attacking boat could turn on a search light as well as the attacked Everything would this appear blurred and uncertain to the gunners, who would be man even worse pre- dicament than the Bisley marksman with the sun in his eyes It would be impossible to describe the effects of colour produced by the search- light when turned directly towards an observer, some of which are, of course, common to arc lights under all circumstances. The normal ray Â¡sasilvery white, but when the light burns badly the rays appear surrounded by prismatic colours, among which violet is predominant. As a rule, those portions of the ship using the light that are caught in the ray stand out in a beautiful rose-pink. The water, where the light touches it seems an intense, almost a butter- cup, yellow fringed with emerald green, and shading off into deep blue-black shadow. No painter has yet attempted to grapple with these changing hues and strange effects. They are vivid almost beyond belief, and add in no slight degree to the poetry of the search-light.
