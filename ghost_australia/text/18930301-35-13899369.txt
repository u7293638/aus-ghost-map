Again, it is said your preachers don't tell woilthy mon often enough to empty their pockets and supply pressing needs I very much foar that some who say this with loud voice in the open air, aro not always m the churchos to listen to what preaohers really do say. I beg to inform these accusers that preachers of the Gospel in aU churches do tell rieh mon and rich women to be generous and charitably.

For several years past, and even in tho year just closing, tho searcmng eftects of crntical invesligatiou are carsing tho frieuds of tho Bible to ask this question Is evolution going to destroy too foundation of all religion by destroying tho belief in a personal God ? Are the scientific investigators into nature, its laws and forms, going to push back Providence till Christians are compelled, either so to change their thought of divine care and superintend- ence, or to deny it altogether ? Are the examiners into tho contents of tho books of tho Old and New Testaments going to shatter our faith in tho Divine origin of the book? These are serious questions, and demand an answer. OUR ANSWER. And we aro ready with an answor. Evolution has not explained away tho Being of God, but simply gives another explanation of His method of cm tiou, and tho continuance of llis works Life mid order and heimt} and co 11 scion co in mnn, and ends and designs in nature, togifhi r w ith the unquestion- able prevalence of goodness and wisdom everywhere, will not allow intelligent and unprejudiced man to disturb the corner stone of your faith and deny God Let these searchers into nature know Christ and then ln tho face of their sinless Redeemer they will know God The examination of the contents of dod's word may change our definition of Inspiration, and it is remarkable that a definition has not been im imposed by tho Catholic-the universal Church of God But that definition will not change our doctrine— that tho book—wonderful for its antiquity-super- natural in its doctrinal and ethical teaching, and always soul-ervating when men will comply with its directions, will remain as the Word of God Do you think that this method of interpreting tho first chapter of tho Book of Genesis will destroy man's confidence in Christianity ? Never. When a new interpretation was adopted by Dr Chalmers, Dr Buckland, and Hugh Miller, some began to fear But Chalmers had more confidence in his Bible than he had in tho theories of scientific men While these ideas were distributed freely amongst multitudes of Christians, Christianity was not abandoned See how wonderfully great truths were harmonised by this learned interpreter of nature, who still ra« maincd as did millions moro in loyal attachment to tlio Bible feo long as wo ha\o a laing Christianity, a holj seed, a fresh baptism of tho Holy Ghost on e\ cry fresh convert to tho Christian faith, there is no danger of the extinction of Christianity " There was,' says Dr Smith, of America, ''a striking device among tho Huguenots, 1 think, representing mou with hammers striking upon au am,ii Ofhor mon uro standing by with fresh hammers, to tako tho placo ot thoso th it w en, bl olen * Pound iw ay, 3 o róbela ' was their motto, jour hammins break tho an\ 1 ot God s word stands ' " bo long as Chris- ti lint) suppluH tho needs of man, which infidelity 111 an\ and all its forms novei can, aud so long as practical Chnsttanity touchos and blesses mon m all relations of life, mon w ill bo too wiso to allow it to pass away Tho best tieasuro which God has bo Btowed w iso and honest and grutoiul men will keep on earth as long as the) can MA VI ADlERSAnn-O T))ero is no doubt the Christian Churches in these lands aro greatly hindered in thou work Wro aro bound m all faithfuluoss to si} that when a trans- gresión of God n law is fl igrautly indulged in by men in Purhumontari power, and by those under P irh uneut who ought to act duïtrently moi al n d spmtual lujurv must onsuo llio new lino ot rail wa} leading on to tlio Bino Mountains vi is opuued on a Sundnv, causing, s ly s ouo of tho daily newspapers, much work Is this right?
