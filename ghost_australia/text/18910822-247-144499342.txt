SELECTIONS. Tlio Sin of Omission. Bv Margaret E. Sakcsteb. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you a bit of a headache At th' netting the sun. Tin* tender word forgotten, 'l'lw Ivtter you did not write, The Howft you might have sent, dear. Are your haunting ghosts to-night. Tho stono you might have lifted Out of a brothor'ri way, Tho bit of hearlhsome counsel, You are hurried too much to say. TI10 loving touch of the hand, dear, Tho gentle aud winsome tone, That y-.»u had no time nor thought for, With trouble enough of your own. Thoro littlo acts of kindness, So easily out of iniud, Tbfwe cbancon to be angels, Which oven mortals nnd— They come in night and silence. Each chill, reproachful wraith, Whvn hope i*» faint aud (lagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is .ill too short, dear, And whtow is all too great, To suffur our flow com|»assion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing to do, dear, H'k the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter headache At the netting of the sun.
