Jeanie - would »lt in her little garden overlooking the ,cove, pretending to darn the curate'B aocks, but watching the lessening craft with pate cheeks end anxious eyes, which not all Bilph Burton'* efforts at cheering oould bring b»ok to their normal brightness. He was not fond of the sea either, except when it was fairly emoobh and.the aua shining on it; *o, though sticking like a leeoh to his friend at other times, he° seldom nceoxupuiUu ulm on these fishing.trips. .Boms people said: after- wards that he stayed on chore on purpose to undermine Hugh by making love to Jeanie in hia place; but at the time ills friend, never suspeoted such » thing- for a moment, and it wouldn't, .have been muoh use anyhow. Joanie's heart went with the one aboard the bout, and, If she bad any liking for the other, it was because he admired Latimer as much as she did. ' Balph saw that pretty clearly f pr hiauelf. .':.''? : There was one drawback to these maritime excursions. Latimer wa* a great- favourite' with the fishtrmen. He used to give them money to drink, and they made him drink with them. Perhaps their Coarse,1 fiery; brandylwdrniora (fleet on his' head thsn on theirs; but 'anyway, it was the old Btory. Mora than once Hugh was brought home too .drunk to walk,, and held on hi* legs by a couple of sturdy fisher-lads. Once or twice he never came home at all ; and Rilphj going to look for him in the morning, found him Bleeping off the effects of- a night of rough festivity in one of the squalid cabins by the beach. It came out later that Mr. Garaton saw him in that condition one* ; and, thongh he made*noi mention of it then, his manner towards the young 'man altered' from that day, and Hugh found it no longer ?nsy to get Je«nie to himsolf. There was always some obstacle^ In the way : either the curate Bat down by them, and made a ' third, or he sent his daughter off on Bome pretext, and enterlauied her lover himself. Jeanie didn't like it. at all, and^Hugh was furious. He evea swore at Bilph one evening, beoause, in couBtquenCe of theae manoauvre*, the latter had enjoyed quite a long UU-i-UU with their bewitching; little hoiteaa/and was, la hia 'slugglah way— the dull fool didn't see how he . bored . the poor ghrl— somewhat elated in cbniequehos.

The curate was a* hard as adamant, and would have none of him. The old story of ' those gambling debts was brought up ; and finally it appeared that Mr. Garaton had already been in communi cation with old Litimer, the unole, who had' written him such a letter respecting his nephew's oharscter as would 'have justified any father in shutting Us doora on' him.

Balpb, who was aa slow and steady aa old Time, was afaTOurite with the curate, and could tell him. the truth about that exaggerated shindy at John'*, and show him that old Litlmer's account of his nephew was' simply founded on spita and prejudico.
