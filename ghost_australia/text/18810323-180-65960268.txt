Moimghau, cettitmly knows what cricket is, and how to manage his lean; ; he dues not allow his luen to go cutting about the field out of their proper places as is the great fault With ilie PlatiUtfeuet Club. On Monday tite stores were all closed, «sti our aunuai Voluuieer sbootiug match took place; the scoring was very low owing to tlit- want of practice. The hi best scores were «ja-ie by Messrs Keyser, Liutieid, Ward, Buggitis, aud luntrs. In the evening the votuiiteers lisul a motiater ball, which was very well attuwled, aud, owing to the ctiutrtistuf tlie tallies' dresses, iiiatiy of which were exceedingly tasu-iul, awl the military costume ui the geutleuien, quite a btuiutitul scene was created, aud everythmjj; pa^ed off must plvasautly. In build lug, t'jo, Albany is goiug ahead, many large aud tspensive tiouaes and stores are iu curse »f erection ; the National Batik is a'-'iit to commence a large biiiitiing to serve ia lien of the pigeon hole they imw occupy.
