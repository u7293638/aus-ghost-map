LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, JULY 23. If one party is pleased by the result of the elections, the other hand some " gratifying in cidents to put a.) confer. It true one has been beaten the other Ima lost many " great chiefs. ' If the wigwam of the grand old medicine man is rather empty, be busseveial line scalps in it for my part I take no pleasure in the one view nor in the other success, to my mind, is only defeat under another name, and vice MIMI. "Another such a victory and the Liberal cause will be undone if the conquest of Mr Tim Henly did give me a private burst of satisfaction, I repented of it when I heard the shouts at "Lords over the defeat of Joseph Arch Such personal rejoicings upon either side are contemptible As the 'J ones exclaimed when Disraeli went much too fast for them, ' We are being dragged through the dirt -Next week the dust of battle will have cleared away a hit and we shall breathe a purer air I thought that the "Great Unpaid' at Eastbourne had been putting its foot in it when it condemned a poor homeless youth to a months imprisonment with hard labour for sleeping in a boat upon the bench I was not at all alarmed upon the boys account, for supposing his innocence was established it was certain he would be a made man there is no shorter way to a competence than that of being the victim to the injustice of our Dogberries, and acting upon the advice of Charles Dickens, who once told me never to be hasty as a leader in condemning the decision of a judge, jury and even a bench of magistrates, who have had the advantage of see if the prisoner, I waited for Hitler accounts of him It now turns out that while by no means in the starving condition which he had been described to be himself, this youth and a skeleton key in his pocket to account for the possession of an article of this kind would tax. the ingenuity of an attorney general the honestest man in the world even you, Mr I ditor-might feel a natural hesitation in explaining the matter satisfactorily Yilmt JOINS. one Bay' One would have to make licensees the classes against the masses " If I had been a rich man, your honour, and the key of my own strong box had been found upon me it would not have been accounted as a crime, and since I have no stir in box, but only hope to have one some day, what is more natural than that I should have provided myself beforehand with a skeleton key in readiness for such a stroke of good fortune ' I feel that all the eloquence in the world would be unavailing in urging such a plea, and before any more evidence of a damaging character came down against me from London I should propose to their honours on the bench to settle my little matter of t hand without sending it for trial, which is just in fact what they did do One course only could have saved that boy Klie Util had but eighteen pence instead of a half penny, he might have telegraphed to the "Universal Knowledge Information office, in Bloomsbury, which, toe the small sum of one shilling and upwards, guarantees to answer "every conceivable question, whether a man or important ' 'the institution stn s the advertisement, has access to all the sources of information in existence, and perhaps it could have told otic.oung friend how he came to have that skeleton key in his pocket Another baronet's daughter wishes to find " a happy home for herself and maid " within H miles of London If it were not for that prOMSons to locality., I should, have supposed it was the same aristocratic lady has; applied for this Besides alum six months ago through the same medium, namely), an advertisement in 'The 1 times Like her, she informs us that no middle class people need apply,' and that " the terms of the upper class people must be moderate " -Ey own impression is that it is the same lady but not the same maid 'The new maid will not stand the country at any price, however moderate If the lady's rank were a little lower I am convinced she would find less difficulty in get ting suited If she were a Knight s widow, for example, she would be Lady Blank,, and for all small social purposes as good as a marchioness But her particular distinction as a baronet s daughter is lost to " upper class people " through the impossibility of expressing it They can hardly Ba>, " This is Miss-lhvt.1., a baronet's daughter, when in reducing her to their friends I have a genuine interest in tins homeless but highly born individual, and would gladly over her, an ass him under my own room, but, unfortunately, we are only middle class people of 'I lie tumult of Purhainentnn warfare has prevented any, one from pay ing attention of late weeks to all phenomena that are not electoral, otherwise there was a case of suicide in J ranee -Inch might well have arrested the attention of all who are interested in the oats s indulge in human nature.

Lyne of a Suicide is both noteworthy and characteristic It is not because we are lacking in loyalty, but because the keeping of times and seasons from nine entries up to centenaries, is a matter foreign to our national genius, that the notion of celebrating the Queen's jubilee does not take much hold upon the public mind The occasion, after all, is something similar to that of a golden wedding, which though affording a good deal of ground for satisfaction in the mayor retrospect, is hard by a subject for vehement congratulation as regards the future Such proceedings always seem to smack of a certain sense of security and even pessimism of things having turned out, on the whole, much better than could have been expected-a feeling which, perhaps, lies at the root of our regard for old families," which, even if they have done nothing for anyone but themselves, but only vegetated, excite our admiration for having contrived in this struggling world, to keep their heads above ground so long Of this want of national enthusiasm for the jubilee, no example could be stronger than the suggestion of the Bishop of Carlisle, that the idea should be embodied in the erection or some edifice for the accommodation of con- vocation Of course, there is nothing like leather, ' but one would have thought that even a bishop would have shrunk from such an amazing proposition as to spend public money upon so shadowy an object, the powers of Convocation are exactly similar to those "archdeacons functions for which neither synonym nor definition could be found, and to build a dwelling for it would be as though the Ps) ducal Society should club together to erect a lordly mansion IOI some homeless ghost to haunt The bishop may congratulate himself on an entirely original idea , as was said of the stone from David's ship, when it struck Goliath, it had never entered my. anyone's head before " A gipsy is by himself an interesting per- square, even a whole family of them in a tent in a woodland lane provided you do not go into the tent form an attractive picture, but gipsies " wholesale and for exportation are a very embarrassing commodity A band of no less than one hundred of them from Greece, bound for the United States, were disembarked in consequence of some dispute with the captain of the ship, near the Mill will docks the other day, to the great inconvenience of the neighbourhood. They had no occupation, no visible means of livelihood, and no interpreter. Their encamp- ment, it is true, has been visited by thousands of sightseers, but all that they seem to have bestowed upon them were " showers of old shoes for luck." As the gipsies do not wear shoes, even this very limited species of benevolence was of little use to them. By some misapprehension, most fortunate for Millwall, these amazing settlers were invited to Liverpool and there they have now " squatted." It is said that persons " so disposed " can be killed by the shock of good news, as surely as he ever tidings, but it is only too certain that the latter case happens much oftener than the former. A very curious case occurred last week of a journeyman in the employment of a large firm being unexpectedly made manager, and thereupon committed suicide. It is possible that " the masses" may eventually get so much the upper hand of " the classes " that all high places will be full of danger, and the last thing to be desired will be promotion, but in the present case the disturbing cause seems to have been the fear of responsibility, and a sense of incompetency to fulfil the duties of a new and important office. In this view the circumstance is, so far as I know, unparalleled. A friend of mine, however, sits at a desk in a great house in the city, where a catastrophe of even a still more painful kind took place. One of the clerks, after many years faithful service, was offered a partnership, which he declined upon the ground of not possessing the minimum sum requisite for investment in the concern. " That shall be no obstacle," Build the principal, " for I will advance it to you myself ;" and so the matter was arranged. But on the very first day of the new partner's taking possession of his desk, he blew his brains out at it, leaving a few written words behind him to say why. He had been embezzling money from the firm for many years, though in such small sums that the whole amount was trifling, and there was no chance of the defalcations being discovered, Remorse, and the sense of benefits undeserved had been, however, too much for his tender conscience. This has always struck me as being one of the few romances that " the city" (i.e., commercial life can call it's own. However common drunkenness may have become, it is certainly much rarer than it used to be to see a glutton. There is still a legend that all aldermen are given to over- eating themselves, but whatever truth there may have been in the assertion at one time, there is little ground for it now. In old days, perhaps the dinners at the Mansion- I house were very much better by comparison than those given in private houses, which is by no means the case in the present day ; moreover, there was no smoking, which the doctors tell us is a great check on appetite ; whether that be so or not, the man who loves his cigar is eager for it, so soon as he has had sufficient food-has " built up a wall, as I once heard a devotee of tobacco express it, "strong enough to smoke against It is now only among the very lowest of the population that gluttony can be said to be prevalent and I think, even in that case, it is not so much the vice that is to blame -as some unusual opportunity of getting a profusion of good food. Last week an iron striker killed himself by rising, after a heavy meat tea on Saturday night, at 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, and eating voraciously of ham and eggs. The evidence showed that he was a ."¿reat,glutton," and certainly, Massacre was his habit, Ilcliognbulus himself, must have been a moderate man compared to him. '.'

If he succeeds in persuading Holopnu that sausages are unnecessary, he may be considered to have effected his object.
