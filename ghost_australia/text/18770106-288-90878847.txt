THE MYSTESIES OF CEIME; OE, The Experiences op ah' Ediitbdtigh DETECTrvE.—Ko. XXVIII. [Published by special arrangement with the , Author.] A LONG CHASE AND A STERN CHASE. I don't know why I disliked Huggett — ' The Crawler,' as he was called. There was even a spice of hate in the feeling — a deep-rooted aversion or disgust. Some simple-minded people may think that we should hate all thieves. But we don't; we have our likes and dislikes, 'just the same as other folk.' Huggett was an ugly, dark-skinned, shifty-eyed villain— a stealthy thief — full of plots, and as deep as the grave ; but that was not the cause of my hate. That lay deeper — so deep that I could never get at it. It was something about the man — something repellant and horrible — but what that something was I never could tell, even to myself. ^ |' Could you believe it? Huggett's got work !'' some one said to me one day, while we were chatting about ' our bairns.' ' It'3 a fact — down near the foot of the Canon gate, in a baker's shop !' | ' In a baker's ?' .1 incredulously echoed. ' What can he do at that ? He was a brass founder originally — a foreman, too — before he came down by the run by stealing thirty pounds worth of copper and -brass.' ffe,' Yes ; but he does not work at making the bread : he only carries it out to the customers.' ? . ., . ' What in the world has set him to that ? Does he get much ?' ' Twelve bob a-week.' I was surprised-— completely taken aback by the news. I did not thiek it impossible fora thief to turn honest, though the thing : is certainly not an everyday occurrence ; but Huggett, 'The Crawler' — the man who had such a mortal aversion to work that the most stringent prison rules seemed to have no effect on mm ? — no, I could not believe it. 'I think you're mistaken,' I simply answered. ' Til believe it when I see him carrying the loaves.' . ' That's just why I believe it. I saw him at it yesterday.' - ' You did? Then it's true.' I said no more aloud ; but at once, and very decidedly; I thought to myself — 'There's something in the wind. I wonder what it is. I'll keep an eye on Mr. Huggett.' One peculiarity of ' The Crawler ' was that he was always indulging in petty thefts, or planning great robberies; with him there, was no intermediate stage. Which wa)5vhe at now? I didC not for a } moment -credit him with ^turning over a; new leaf '—unless that ;ineant ,enWing a new_«»here of ,crimer.; . Whether this was prejudice on any part w|ll 'appear before T amdone. Studying the thing, over ^ in my mind, andfsettiug down all I knew of the man's nattoe and the -degrading ;saerifi.ce /which he would consider he i 'wasmakjajg? in this new line, I concluded that he was c? crawling '—that is, stealthily working ? towards some great object. .. No, petty jjhefW. would repay him for sweating and toiling day a|ter^day under ajheavy baker¥h6ard; and I- khewl that/like % number of Msielass) he had an insane idea of some day making a grand^stt^e Hand then retiring from '«th' e profession.'' I say ^ f insane idea, = because such- thieves never seem to realise the fact tLat they are -like horseleechesT^lettaing out, quite as fast as they, suck in. 'Lightly come, lightly gone,' is *he invariable rule. Now, having settled that he was after/ something noteworthy; itJjwas natural that* I should look out for the intended 'victim. As natural was it — seeing, as 1 didj only ttie . surface/;6f things, andijibt being nearlyjso deep as. the man who.&ccupfed.; mysj)are thoughts— that I -shpuld plump on his .new, . employer, -the, baker. The conclusion was \- -.rash), ana wro.ng entirely, as I shall show,, but it was natural. , ?;.,_.. ;. ?;.-?',? -. ;? Gf this baker, then, in a roundabout way, * I made some cautious enquiries. .'- : But-I;found myself at fault- »The baker knew in a vague^way;- -ifo& ^charaje^sr of ? the.J manne emplbyea— ^had received^ ;nb forgM' character or recommendation with him — arid simply took care of himself .by trusting, the man in nothing. Huggettwas his-jjorter; ; working hat d -for two shillhigs ^a-day— nothing more. ... . . I had no idea of hunting down the mail simply because he was an, old gaol-bird; but t niust.say that 1 let him and his move _ m«nt6 but of my niind' leltt^tantly,' and jn dotibt. 1 was balked — mystified— but not blnded. One round with Huggett in his daily calls, if I could have had it, would have opened my eyes. This was how it came about. Down past the Abbey Hill stood a large self-contained house, at which Huggett called twice every day — in the morning with rolls, and in the afternoon with bread. The three servants — two of them light headed girls — were charmed and delighted with the new baker?s man. Be chatted to them — joked with them — flattered them — and gained their favor and confidence as n ) baker's man had ever done before. He was a single man, too — he told the u so — and though he wasn't exactly young, njr exactly what you could call good-looking — there was no saying what might happen. So the silly things reasoned and thought, ? as they looked forward to his visits as al most the only lively thing about the house hey had to look forward to. 1 don't think that their master, Charles Scott, Esq., would have been mightily pleased at the familiar intercourse that linked his servants ' with the outer world, had he known of it. He was a gentleman in wealth and position, but had an eccentric distrust of banks, bank-notes, cheques, and bills, and an idea that his wealth was far safer in his own possession, in the tangible form of firm yellow gold. It was comfort able to have his surplus money in the same room with him — to sleep with it^-on it, in faet; but the circumstance gave him an unquenchable hatred to strangers, loafers, and followers. He was inexorable on this point. The servants knew it — agreed to Ms stringent rules, and then laughed at them. 'He thinks we're bairns a'ihegither,' chuckled one of them to the new baker's man one afternoon, about three weeks after the beginning of their acquaintance. ' He wad make us intae nuns if he got the chance, but he'll find himsel' mistaken.' ' He will indeed,' chorused the thief. 'But why is he afraid of a bit sweetheart coming after you? Does he think they would run away with you ?' ' No ; it's the tin-box he's afraid of.' ' What tin-box?' 'The box he keeps his money in — he sleeps wi't under him. ' There's *a square hole in the mattress for it to lit intae. It's full o' gold — thousands o' pounds, they say'— . : . 'Jane!' It was the cook, the oldest of the three, who broke in with the warning reprimand. *' Tuts ! what's the herm o' speakin' aboot that ?' heedlessly persisted the girl. ' Oo'r no gaun tae run away wi' his box o' gold !' This seemed a good joke. The girl re membered afterwards that Huggett laughed long and heartily at the remark. He ap peared elated too — suddenly and unaccount ably — and the girl began to think that surely she had said a clever thing. But she was wrong — as people generally are when they flatter themselves. The cause of his joy was that the information he had been feel ing after ever since he put -his head under the baker's board had now come to him unsought and unbidden. - ? ^ ' I suppose you would need to run away with him, too, if you tried it ?' he laugh ingly put in. ' Yes ; or get a lot o' lead bullets in your skin/' rejoined the girl. r - -.-: ? Huggett's smile died away. '- 'JWhat's that you sa^ about Wile is]?' he. hastily enquired, with such- concern that the girl began to f ear- he was a little chicken-hearted. 'Pistol bullets, I mean. He keeps a pair of loaded pistols under his pillow. But, man, ye dinna need tae be feared ; he never: brings them near the kitchen.'1 'I don't like pistols, nor bullets either,' replied Huggett, ^ speaking the truth for once.* ' If my friend, Mr. Smith, knew there was such a thing in the house, Tm afraid he wouldn't come to-night.' ' Oh, but you don't need tell him.' ' Exactly ; neither I will. But I must confess that I myself would feel more com fortable if, when you're dusting bis room, you could just slip the caps off them, p he heard a noise^ he might take it into his head to send a quick messenger down through the floor.' li Ha, ha, ha ! Oh, Mr. Huggett, what a funny man you are !' cried the girl, to his chagrin taking, as a joke what he meant as a serious hint. u- But I'm serious/' he persisted. ' Yes— ha, ha, ha ! That's just what? makes it so funny !' He gave it up as a bad job. I ; 'Well, don't say anything about it to Mr. Smith.' : .' Oh,.no, not a word. Is he handsome ?.' 'I should think he is. He's a great ; swell, too ; so you'll need to mind your pY 'iQuite* prince,! suppose?' put in^the cookj-i^Q^was. rather above the age for tak^g^ a' deep interest in t'&ese; '.matters! i ' ^axjtly-^oii've just hit it,' stammered Huggettjv a little unguard^fliyr .'; (e A;greait many-do X5all him ^.The:i?rinieei'-' ' ?? ; '' The Prince^ Oh, thafs- delightful!' cried the girls. ; 'Now, don't come i =without him on any faccount.' y._ A---* ?;?*/?

' What time shall ?we come?' ;' f'As sogn as* you please after seven; not much later, for prayers are at nine, aiid ? yoiipnust he away by then.' '. ,- ^'Perhaps not,' thought Huggett. 'That -jpartofthe arrangement must be altered?' ; Then he added aloud— . ' 'But ^The Prince' cannot cbine till afterV reight, The bank that he is principal cashier in does not closje till then.' ..;. ' - Priiieipal-cashier 1— only to think of that ! The girls were in a flutter. 'Well, come as soon as ever you can; but don't c-?me without ;Mrv Smith.' , /^But'how are we to getin? If we should , be late, jit,: would never do to ring, you know.' ' 'V ... 4 f ^Oh, that'seasiij:' managed!: ?We'|l lea,ve ; the, outer gate; off t^he sn*eck]Tand you ban 311st slip down the area stair and give. a gentle-knock.

'^Well,- Miss Flora g^es to bed shortly . after prayers; but her father sits up till 12. .and one, sometimes, reading.' ??'?*'?' ??'? 'This last question and answer, even5 to the girls' shallow intellects, seemed a little off the subject. _ It was^ odd, they after wards remarked among themselves^ that the baker's man should take an interest in the hour, that their employer retired to rest ; hvt therf he wa«iin odd man :aitbg«fch«r, aad tihey rather thought, on the whole, that, if they found 'The Prince,' anything like agreeable to their tastes, they would throw the baker's man overboard again. And so they planned how they would suit them selves, while Huggett departed and planned exactly the same thing. But the little supper they set themselves to prepare out of Mr. Scott's stores-got leave to frizzle and spoil by the fire : for 8 o'clock came arid wore past without any signs of. the invited guests. Another hour wore away, and then with damped spirits they resigned themselves to the cDnviction that their intended pleasure was postponed, for that night at least, and went up to prayers. Accordingly, when, they returned to the kitchen, it was with real alarm that they heard a tap on the glass of the window. They ran to see the cause, and found Huggett, respectably dressed, and by ;his side a -handsome young man, in hat and gloves, pulling away - dUigeutly at a cigar. This last, of course, was ?' Mr. Smith,' ov in other words the veritable 'Prince of Cheek.' The girls, all in a flutter^ gently raised the window and spoke throug-k the iron bars — 'Oh, what a pity ! why didn't you come in'time ? We can't let you in now, and the beautiful supper is all spoiled.' ' Never mind the supper, my dear,' put in 'The Prince,' graciously waiving the necessary introduction. '.It was you, not the supper, we came to see,' and then he launched into a stream of nonsense that fairly took their breath away, and their wits along with it. 'What a pity ! could we not let them in, justfora minute ?' they relentingly asked. But the cook was inexorable, and stopped them at once, Huggett's cunning came to- the rescue. ' It is a pity,' he carelessly remarked, 'for, see, we have two bottles- and we thought to have enjoyed ourselves.' The cook's eyes sparkled, -and the f rigid Hues of herf ace softened visibly. She looked enquiringly at the girls — the girls looked enquiringly at her — and they read the thought in each others' eyes. ' We'll let them in — just for a minute or two.' It was the old story of the wolf and the woodman — they had some trouble to get in, but when they were in they were in1 no hurry to leave. Indeed the girls were in no hurry to press their departure. 'The Prince ' carried everything with, him— his glib tongue had done the same before with wiser heads, and, as he rattled' on, in! their simplicity they began to wonder how such a distinguished gentleman came to; be acquainted with a common man like 'Mr.., Huggett. The hours i flew Jbjj the supper was consumed, and then one! of the bottles was passed round. In tf subdued, cautious, way they thus enjoyed themselves, mani festing great interest in the construction :of the house and the exact locality of the various rooms, and inore^gai'ticufaxly: the sleeping apartment, of Mr. Scott himself . At last, however, when the conversation,; began to flag, Mr. Huggett twitted the 'Prince' withnot sending round 7«&: bottle. The 'Prince' modestly replied /-that he. would be only too happyj only it happened? to contain brandy, a .liquor ''hyj&xV; too strong for ladies. Sir. \Huggett did' -'not think the difficulty an insurmountable: one ; the brandy was produced, and, after an apology for a slight, jmuddiness in the color, each was with some=diEculty;fbrced toswallowa small glassfuL. -- .-?;. This was the last thing the servants re membered. The drink ~was heavily drugged^ and their senses must have leftthemMmost immediately after swallowing it ; for not, the slightest recoUectibn of any after coa-r vernation dwelt in any of their ininds. - Not a moment was lo$t. ? The two thieves1 'slipped o'ff their hoots and ^tuck them in their pockets— took off their coats and hats, opened the area^xloor 'wide to the back, and placed them in^readiness oti the steps, after taking from aiiadk pocket the: took they were about to use—a f neddy ??' and a i 'jemmy?': Then they crawled upstairs--; noiselessly as i serpents-— straight 'for Mr, Scott's bedroom; : He w&s; in Joed, but not asleep as.they had imagined/ arid their jjbrat! triarof the door made him \start bolt tro right, and sharply demand ':Wfao was. there?' .:..?..'

I looked alon£ — there were only three carriages, and the sjieed of the train as yet was not great— I would try the next. Now, to pass from «ne carriage to another while the train is -in motion may be very easy to a raiLway guard or a ticket collector ; but I am bound io say that I did not find the task an easy one. When it came to the wide 'leg' ': between the ivro f ootboards, I had a great ' inclination to pause. But the other car riage so near — and perhaps nxy man inside —the excitement carried me over. The iron clinches held fast, and I stuck to them like grim death, and got over safe and 'sound. The first compartment contained ?r two ladies, who screamed oiit as I swang ' into sight 'before their window; the .aiext was empty;''- the next con~ tained one passenger, a gentleman, * ' who seemed 'buried in thought, with ,3iis eye.jreeting complacently on a crutch I propped in the comeT before him.

I found my man on deck, taking Ins first and last look at the country of his adoption, and nt once pounced upon him and swung- him round to face me. ' Mr. McGovau !:' I cried, witli mosk fervor and undisguised exultation, as I seized his hand and wrung it warmly. ' How do you do ?' The whole thing cuiyie on him so suddenly, and perhaps iu the midst of dreams of safety, that he could not utter a word, but gasped, and whitened, and tottered till he had sunk in a grovelling heap on the deck. My next pleasant task was to relieve him of Mr. Scott's money (which, with the exception of about twenty pounds, I found sewed into his undershirt) and h ive him locked up. After a few legal difficulties had been got over, I was allowed to remove him and the plunder on board a return steamer ; and in fifteen days I landed in Liverpool highly delighted with my trip. Mr. Scott slowly recovered from the brutal injuries he had received, but he was never the same man again. He is dead now, and I am convinced that Huggett's handiwork that night shortened his life by some years. But of course, as the law looks at it, as there was no man killed, there could be no murder: and Huggett was simply treated to retirement from active life for ten years. ' The Prince*' get off with five, and, as I may show hereafter, it was liis last conviction. I got five too, but mine were pounds, given ice as & sort of 7ionopfr rium. I wish, however, that I had seen a ittleof America when I was at it. ;
