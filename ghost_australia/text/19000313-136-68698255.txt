THE DRUMMER =AND THE DRUMMER. 1.-W?AI. "W'hy, you're a Yankee, :ren't you'" That was what UGladys Clayton, a lit tie Southern girl, said one morning to a small boy dressed in blue. who. upon tier :ipproach h:ln half risen to a sitting pos ture beside :t patch which led both to a spring :Itd a negro cabin. within hail int dist:ane of the spot where the re clniing uniformed ligure was gazing ill open-eyed wonder on the vision of juve nile loveliness. "'Yes, I'mt a Yank." replied the boy. itt stinctively, saluting; "you can tell thatt biy liy blue." Then lie p)atisl for a: se conindand said. hesitatingrly: "Of coutrse you are--are-a-". The boy inl blue blushed. and the little maid. with a twinkle in her eyes. said: "A little rebel. Do you surrender?" "Hardly," replied the boy. mqking an endeavor to take his feet. but falllng hack until he suplported himself upon his elbow. An expression of pain swept over his face which startled the child, as she exclnimed, in sympatletic tones: "O. dear. what a pity! You are wound ed. and only a boy!" Then, as a rtes stturance. she added: " You needn't be afraid. Yankee boy: I won't hurt you. and all the gray soldiers are gonen away." "VW'here am I?" asked thie drummer boy. "You are on the Clayton plantation. Yankee boy. My mother says that it is .20 miles from Nowhere. and the last place that was nuade." - "There's been a big tight." said the boy: "whitch licked?" "Mother says-that she rieckols they both got atll they wanted, and then with drew' in good order.": answered thie girl. - '"Where is your father?":' . "Licking Yankees." was the reply.with : gr'eat deal of energy thrown into the words. '0O, ho!" exclaimed the boy. and then, in spite of himself. he permitted a troan to escape his lips. "0. dear," said the girl. coming close unp to him. _ "Are you hurt much, little Yatkee boy?" For a moment the boy in blue had forgotten himself, as -he asked in aindxiety: \- 'Please, little " girl, have you seed my drum". t-> The-girl lookedl up apldi:lowyn tie path on either sid.
