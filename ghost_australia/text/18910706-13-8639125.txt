In other words, will he impose new burdens on the people or will he retrench? For many reasons the latter course has to be strongly advocated. The present moment is not by any means an expedient one for additional taxation, Something, perhaps, may be gained from the excise, though the local optionists may provide that any beer tax shall disappear in compensation to evicted publicans. But all other charges would be a mistake at the present juncture. A land tax would have a most unfortunate effect after a boom which has left an enormous number of properties on the hands of individuals, syndicates, and companies that can ' scarcely stagger under their heavy loads. Whatever there is to be said for a general land tax, it is evident that such an impost is highly inadvisable at a moment when real estate is suffering from a temporary but a most unfortunate and a severely felt depression. The first task of the Government is to do all things that will tend to bring about levelness and confidence, and assuredly it would be a great error to take action that would render it more difficult for owners to hold on, and would thus materially deepen the gloom. A land tax to-day would be a tax on losers who have been heavily hit. A dividend tax is not open to this objection, but it is a stop to the capital which we wish to attract here. An income tax is scarcely likely to be proposed, because a charge so inquisitorial and unfair would provoke a determined resistance. And we do not suppose that anyone wishes to reopen the tariff, and to pile up charges on consumption. Not a new tax of any importance but is to be specially condemned at this juncture. Under such a circumstances the plain course before the Treasurer is to make the year's income suffice for the year's wants, bearing in mind the good old maxim that comes to us from the ages that '.' economy is a great revenue." We may point out where the great increase in expenditure and in charges has been during the past few years, because it is obviously there that we most largely look for retrenchment. During the prosperity period it was natural that money should be largely dispensed in grants and in public works, and during the reaction it is but proper that this outlay should be scrutinised. Contrasting the year 1886 with the year 1890, we have the following extra charges : Increase. Mining grunts 27,000 Public works . 473,000 Municipal endowment ... 140,000 railway loss is)?)...' ... TOOGOOD £88,000 That is to say, the charge on the revenue was increased during the period in question by this large sum with regard to these particular items. If the Treasurer could put himself back into the position of the Treasurer of 1880, and spend no more on the services in question than was then spent, then he would not be troubled by the prospect of a deficit, but, on the contrary, he would be congratulating himself upon a credit balance. It is these items and others similar to them that will demand consideration. In the event of any reduction it would be a pleasure to restore most of them to their present standard when the revenue is once wore buoyant, but it may be fairly urged that so enormous an additional outlay ought to be largely dependent upon revenue conditions. As to the affected interests, if the issue is put before them-" Would you prefer heavy permanent and direct taxation, or the postponement of local improvements for a short period? there ought to be little doubt as to the reply. As to the railway revenue, why should not charges be increased and differential rates be imposed upon the losing lines, or expenses be cut down, or some other commercial step be taken to prevent the department, being a charge on the state 'I Apart from the matter we shall, it appears, have to congratulate the Treasurer upon the form of his statement. The separation of the railway account from the ordinary account of revenue and expenditure was strongly urged in the articles which we published at the close of 1889, and, together with the appointment of a committee of finance to prevent back sidings and to keep Treasurers to the one system, will almost complete the reforms then urged as necessary to make our bookkeeping system absolutely fair and costly intelligible. Mr. Gillies took an important step when he fell back upon the old- and proper practice of introducing " additional estimates " at the close of each year to cover all expenditure incurred and paid thereon instead of carrying these items forward as part of the expenditure of the new year The assumption that the charges I had not been incurred and had not been I met, and that the money was in the Treasury, went to show on paper an imaginary surplus. Mr. Musto is now to take another step towards simplification The final reform will probably be left to another Treasurer, and that is to charge the old year, ending with the evening of the 30th June, with the interest which is paid on the morning of the 1st of July. The first object with all national accounts is to avoid the possibility of a misunderstanding, and a wrong impression is possible when a surplus is shown of £600,000, . though immediately the Treasury opens the following day the accountant will make an entry, and deficiency of £-G00,000 or £700,000 will become apparent. However, this change will have to wait, it may be presumed, until another prosperity period occurs. We were strongly in favour of the accounts being re- cast during the surplus period, and of the one year being charged with three half-years' loan interest, but we imagine that the Treasurer will think it inadvisable on the present occasion to swell an announced defi- ciency." Reform is always a matter of opportunity, and a step that is judicious at one time may be eminently injudicious at another. The year which is to come cannot, we fear, afford to make atonement for the fault of its predecessors. Mr. McKie can scarcely venture to do more than to promise to keep the desirability of the change in mind. The reforms he indicates can happily bo made without placing the year in a false position. On the contrary, they will rather tend to abate confusion. Thus as regards the railways, a trading department cannot possibly be bound by the rules of a mere Government office, and the attempt creates extraordinary complications. As matters now stand, the larger the business of the railways the greater is the amount of " additional expenditure " which has to be voted, and though the member for North Melbourne is understood to have grasped the idea that an apparent deficiency may-, as in 1889, conceal an actual surplus, yet few of his colleagues understand a position so worthy of the comic stage. The separation of the accounts will allow the country to see at a glance what the railways make in good years, and what they lose in their bad times, such as the present. Should we be charged with having too strongly and too persistently advocated the simplification of the national accounts, and the presentation of plain and exact statement, the reply must be that simplification and accuracy are potent factors in the cause of economy, and, moreover, that misunderstandings and recriminations tend to damage the public credit. This is the second summer in which Europe has been completely free from the war scare, which for a number of years put forth its blood-red leaves and blossoms in the month of May with unfailing regularity. Ko threats, no rumours of hostilities have disturbed the tranquillity of international politics. Since Boulanukii's fall we have not heard of the frontier incidents that used to set the press of Paris in a rage, and that led the German newspapers to report with angry taunts against their rivals. Three years ago the slightest political movement in a petty Danubian state would have attracted the attention of the whole world, because the Governments both of Russia and Austria would have taken the matter up, and written despatches and accused each other of treachery, and worked themselves into a needless fury.' Nowadays Queen Natalie is expelled from Servia, and Russia does not apparently even take the trouble to protest. Three years ago the European journalists and members of Parliament ? lashed themselves into a state of excitement over the movements of some Arab chieftain, and the Russian Government talked of making settlements in Abyssinia, and the Germans chuckled and rubbed their hands with glee when they imagined that they had encroached by the extent of a building allotment on the English possessions in Central Africa, and the French clamoured wildly for Egypt and the Soudan and the Sahara and the north of the continent in general. At the present day, however, this disposition to quarrel over unknown and unexplored lands has been wonderfully softened, and little difficulty is experienced in coming to terms. We never hear now that irritable despatches pass between London and Berlin because some Hans Schmidt and some John I Smith have had a dispute in Equatorial Africa, and have each been made sulky by knowing that his opponent did not understand the subtle satire involved in his profane language. What are the reasons of the change 1 One is undoubtedly that the Governments perceive the unprofitableness of interfering unnecessarily in affairs beyond their own borders. Africa has not proved either k plain of Beulah or a chain of delectable mountains to the pioneers and explorers, and, as a consequence, the authorities of the different nationalities engaged in colonising the country are less apt to take offence and more ready to conclude agreements. Similar reasoning may apply to the lack of interest shown in the Balkan provinces. It cannot be a worth while for a great power to interfere upon every occasion when the people of Belgrade indulge in a little tumult. But the main cause of the political quietude in Europe is in all probability the existence of the Triple Alliance. Germany, Austria, and Italy are acting in concert . France and Russia are separated from each other and this arrangement of the first-class powers has evidently done much to pro serve peace. The recent renewal of the- Triple Alliance,, however, although it is now declared to be for defensive purposes only seems to have provoked considerable criticism and debate. In Italy the cost of maintaining immense armaments is becoming a burden heavier than can be borne by the people. The country has just emerged from the bad management of independent local governments, and its transition from poverty is hampered, and even checked, by the huge toll that must be paid for warlike preparations. We can hardly be surprised that a section of the Italian Parliament protested vehemently against the foreign policy of the Government. Yet it is difficult to see what other course could be pursued. The Italians can place no reliance upon a friendship with France, for each of the monarchies, republics, and empires with which the French people vary the monotony of the European political constitutions has deliberately encroached upon their national possessions or claims. It is most natural, most expedient for them to seek an alliance with Germany. This may be expensive, but the expense would be none the less if they separated themselves from their allies and stood alone. Hence it is probably that the Marquis Rudini has found himself compelled to adopt the foreign policy of his predecessor. Signor Crispi, who inaugurated the alliance with Germany, was driven from power simply because of the heavy taxation which his war preparations entailed. If his successor in office maintains the same policy, it may be inferred that there is no possibility of reducing the arma- ments, and that the most economical method of defence is to preserve the German alliance. Occasion has, of course, been given both to the French and to the Russians to criticise the agreement between the three central powers. The Czar resents the renewal of it by abandoning his proposed visit to Denmark and Germany. This is a mere piece of pettish ness. The alliance has been in existence for some years, and there was an understanding some months ago that it would be renewed, with a clear proviso that it was intended only for purposes of defence. But an impression seems to have been spread over Europe principally by the German newspapers, which are endeavouring to magnify the strength of the alliance-that Great Britain has now entered into it. Several events give a certain colour to the opinion. The Mediterranean squadron has visited famine, and been received with the most friendly demonstrations by the Austrians. Great preparations have been made in England itself to give a right generous and royal welcome to the Emperor William. Those incidents, however, prove nothing, save the existence of a kindly feeling. Unless Lord Salisbury has suddenly changed the principles of his administration, he cannot have committed his country to any agreement in which it might be made responsible for the policy of a foreign power. And, as a matter of fact, there can be no general alliance, either offensive or defensive, between an insular power like Great Britain and a Continental military Government like Germany. An alliance for a specific purpose there might be, but not a general treaty. Why should England support Germany if war breaks out on the Rhine or the Vistula? Or why should Germany be pledged to support England if hostilities begin over the Newfoundland fisheries or the New Hebrides settlements? It would obviously suit neither power to be pledged to defend the other in all circumstances. At the same time, there can be no doubt as to the side on which the sympathy and the moral weight of the British Empire should be cast. Our interests lie with those of the central European porters, and our troubles come from France and Russia. The cable messages this morning contain several items relating to English opinion on Australian affairs. In addition there is one statement of fact which will be read with regret. The attempt to introduce money and experts into New South Wales to open ironworks in the Illawarra district has been abandoned for the present in consequence of Clio labour trouble and the political develop-, monte in the sister colony. Capitalists, we are told, prefer to wait for a time, in order to see what kind of a bottle ment is effected.
