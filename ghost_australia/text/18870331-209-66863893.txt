His preaching abounds int ther old pictnresof the future, which have alw.tys a power and meuaniig even, to the muii;da of those who have 'depaorted .furth'st from the oeaten pathwale : of the fsilth of'centuries. But' ihfully re ,cocnises at:the same time th. value of the other forns 'which the spirit:of reli gion assumes. ', Divine truth;";le'saye i" is a vast circle so ample in its sweep .that a finite mind can grasp a segment of it here alltthere, but'not" the whole; Our knowledge of'trtli is fragmentary ; i now we, know it in part.' It isn not given to any one man, nor even to any one sectiorn.of the Church, to discern truth in; its entirety, nor to assign to each particular truth its just prpbortion in relation to other truths." His' view of religious differoecesis that best suited to the episcopal mind, if episcopacy, .with its concentration of governhment, is,.to preserve the independeitoe. ,'Every man wh . has been moved by ,the Holy Ghost to take upon him. this otfice and ministry has its own message ,to deliver-a nmessage which he, only can give." Bishop Goe appears to be ei.dowed with the inestimable gift' of a large common sense, and with a faculty of putting the highest truth in the 'nost practical way. His eloquenea is not thcel loqueuec of the schools, bs'tratlter of the man wilio is deeply convintcd ofÂ£ tlheoimportanee of lthe message which he is calledi upoi?: ti tlelive r, a-- tidleppuaks earnestly fronr tlioeheart.
