THE Athenians are to be congratulated on securing a large number of entries for their handicaps this year, but I fear they have st over the meeting by) allowing some very ignorant "Rous to do the handicapping stretched stated the weights must have a very curious idea of the difference between first class nee Horsenail even a second rate animal met the almost impossibility of bringing an Ace, Dug worth Barb, or Don Juan down by weight, to allow the nil 50 to have a ghost of a show Does the Ipswich handicapper imagine that the Queensland cattle are superior to those of Is New "South Wales and Victoria is that he gives the best horse in Australia less weight than he -would have to carry in a Melbourne Cup!
