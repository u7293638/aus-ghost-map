We publish the following this week The stars that glitter in tbe vault of night. The gentle dewdrops on tbe grassy plain; The moon diffusing her nocturnal light, The valley, smiling with its ripening grain; Tbe "birds, that np to heaven's gate ascend These we contemplate with a thrill of joy; But should a ghost the grave's dark prison rend, How would the phantom all such charms destroy.

G. S. Bruce. Twas harvest time; the golden grain Did glitter bright across the plain, Beneath the moonbeams clear; Two lovers walking with delight Beheld a scarecrow and took fright, " A qhose' they screamed, "On dear."
