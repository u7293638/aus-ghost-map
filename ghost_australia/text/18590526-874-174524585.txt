THE GHOST'S APPEAL TO ITS PATRON, PUNCH. Dear Punch I'm in a fearfu' swither Each woman's tongue will brak' its tether— You'll na forsak' your scribblin' brither, Or he can see Frae ev'ra place where women gather, He'll ha'e to flee. Ye ken last week, I said no more, Than "married people by the score, Play pranks they never played before," An' tak' my word, Twa 'r three ha'e kick'd up sic a splore, As ye ne'er heard. I've sold mysel' that's vera plain Each thought I lo'ed but her alane, Bat now they've gat it i' their brain 'Twas a mistake, An' ragin' say "Ye'd best be gane, Ye heartless rake." No doubt auld Judy's tongue's brak' loose An' swears ye're aft in the carouse, And made your while syne cossie house As hot as ----. Sae what I think's our wisest course, I'm gaun to tell. Deil haet's the use o' aught denyin' Or frae the unco clatter flyin', They'd only say that we were lyin' Jist like auld cloutie, If we tauld them we ha'e been pryin' On public duty. No—brave it out an' laugh an' joke About the matrimonial yoke, "Weel-neel" quo' you, "there's naithin' broke Nor aught amiss— Come, put awa' that glow'rin' look An' gie's a kiss." 'Gin that won't do—some day or e'en Just let them hear, we ha'e been seen 'Mang lairds an' ladies a' serene, To chat and smirk Wi' some braw wreath-cap'd bonnie queen, At Coppin's kirk. Ye'll see auld boy afore its lang They'll smile and say, "we may be wrang," To woman's heart pride is a strang Galvanic battery; 'Twill mak' them sing a sweeter sang Than even flattery. For fear, their breasts wi' anger heavin', They'd think an' say— as sure's your breathin,' That's some auld sentimental heathen— Wha care about him." I'll finish up this scrawl by givin' My prayers about them. May ev'ra lassie ha'e her will— May ev'ra wife lo'e her chiel, Heav'n mak' an' keep them blythe an' weel, Baith soul an' body, An' knock wha'er wad do them ill Down wi' a waddy.
