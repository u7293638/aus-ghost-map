DIOCESAN SYNOD OF SYDNEY. j -. The sittings of the Diocesan Synod were resumed at the Church Society's House, Phillip-street, yesterday. The president (the Dean of Sydney presided Prayers having been read, the minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed car horn i E OP AI SOLUTION Mr JOSFI it B DuiiiiA*t rsl eel - ' 1 Is there in a canon or constitution of the United Church of England and Ireland a Inch forbids a des re to read the absolution ' 2 If a deacon be not allowed to read it on account of the rubric stating it is to he pronounced by the priest alone, should he not be equally forbidden to read the sentences ayhichtho rubric states that the Ernest should say 3 Are not the word 3 priests and a rafters convertible terms in the order for morning" prayer ' 4 Is it the doctrine of the United Church of LnJ md and Ireland that the congress itton re i seize the benefit of absolute through a priest pronouncing the absolution to Was not the. word priest at the last revision of the Prayer Book substituted for the word minis I ter in the absolution rubric " The Pi WIDEST replied " 1 I do not know of any such canon but the question is open to much dispute In Dr Bum s Ecclesiastical Law (ninth el, vol in p ofl), I find it stated that it is not clear from the rubric in the Look 1 of Common Prayer whether, or how far a deacon is pro- bible 1 thereby to pronounce the absolution for although it is there directed that the ss he shall be pronounced by the priest alone jet the ord ' in o in in in place seemeth | only to intend that the people eli will rest pronounce j the absolution alter the past as they did the confession just before and the word price t' throughout the rubric doth not seem to be generally appropriated to a parson in priest's offers only Dr Pure goes on to say that the area ent to evince that the Driest only, and not a deacon has power to pronounce the ah out on seen s most cv dently to be deduced from the Acts of Ordin tion To the deacon it is said - and thou authority to read the Gospel and to preach the same, ex ' To the priest -' Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a priest in the Church of God "in whose sins thou dost forgive the, are forgiven and wholesome thou dost retain, they are retained' Mr Durham day will thus see that there are two sides to the question and as I do not sit here as a judge, nor as an authorized expounder of the law, I do not think I am called upon to decide it I will only add that the custom for the Deacon not to pronounce the absolution, seems almost to have grown into a law 2 to answer need he given to this, as it was dependent upon the pros loan question being answered in the negative ¿ I do not think they are so in all cases 4 I am not sure that I take these words as Mr Durham may have intended them. The bench which I understand to be derived from the declaration of forgiveness in the absolution is this-that even one in the congregation who is conscious that he does truly repent and unfeignedly believe the Gospel may take to himself the comforting assurance which, the form of absolution conveys 5 Yes" THE CHill CE! SOCIETY The PRESIDENT informed Mr H S Bond that there were 19 parishes in which branches of the Church Society had been formed, and 20 in which they had not MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT Mr CLARENDON STUART moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of mi' rag a personal explanation There was an article in each of that morning's daily papers reflecting upon himself and those seven gentlemen who voted with him on Friday night last He was accused in one article of being bigoted, and sitting in judgment upon his fellow Christians He was also compared to a Pharisee and the other party were compared to the Publican He was perfectly prepared, if the gentleman chosen, that the other side should adopt the rector the Publican who smote upon his breast, and said, " God be merciful to me a sinner ' but he was not prepared to accept the John of the Pharisee v he said I thank God that I am not as other men " In alluding to dissenters he had, on the contrary storm in the most respectful terms of them, and had said that he envied them many good and clever men they possessed He also complained that he had not only had his motives misrepresented, but, while the speeches of the president and the Rev Mr Barnier, who were opposed to him, had been reported, he (Mr Stuart) had not been reported If, in the arm of her Majesty, a private soldier saw one of his officers going over to the enemy, should he not, as a loyal soldier, take a step to prevent the desertion i Well, he was a private soldier in the army of the Church, and he thought it his duty to do what he could to prevent the division of the four or five others whom he knew were temporising and of those whom he did not know. (Hear, hear) Mr Stuart was proceeding to refer at some length to the subject of the resolution he had proposed on Friday night, when Mr ALExAN.DEr STIJUIT rose to a point of order It would, he thought, be most unwise to reopen the discussion The PRESIDENT ruled that to reopen the discussion would be out of order Mr C STL VI T regretted that he had passed, beyond the bounds of personal explanation He, however, desired to formally draw the attention of the President to a letter turned " Zachary Barry," which appeared in that morning's Herald in reference to the marriage regulations In that letter the writer stated, virtually, that he had acted in pure defiance of the Synod, and gloried in it CONVENTION OF THESE NOR Mr ALEX ANDER GORDON (on behalf of Canon King) moved,-" that 'he Synod's convening rule of 1882 be now read a second time Proposed rule-Whereas it is desirable to determine by rule of Synod the periods within which a Synod of the diocese may be convened and holden, the Synod ordains and rules as folio was -1 AS}nodot the diocese maybe convened and holden at any time by summons of the Bishop or the person by whom, for the time being, the powers vested in the Bishop may be exercised 2 1 his rule may be cited as the ' S} nod s Convening Rule oflSSl' The motion was agreed to the rules passed through committee without amendment, and read a third time and passed SteEL ANNE ATION ORDINANCE. On the motion of "Mr J IMES VICKERY., the Ordinance to amend the Superannuation Ordinance of 1975 was read a third time and passed RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS The Rev W HE\ EMILIE moved,-" I had the name of Mr V W either be added to the committee on the subject of religious instruction in Public schools " In doing so he referred to the second annual report of the committee appointed by the Synod on the 27th day of June 1879, to carry into effect the resolutions passed by the Synod with regard to religious instruction in the Public schools The report was as follows During the year which has elapsed since the last meeting of the SE and, the committee has met twelve times At the beginning of the year the committee had in hand a balance of 163 12s 4d fLe suns since contributed amount to too and further sums have been promised, as will be seen in Appendix A. The expenditure during the year has amounted to £10 12s 8d The following points have been made by the committee -1 The sum of 225 per annum to Mr Raymond. engaged in giving religious instruction in eight Public schools in the district of Hanley Mr Raymond has now left the district, the Rev R H Mayne has not yet found a suitable person to undertake the work 2 The sum of 25 per annun, to assist in providing religious instruc- tion in Crown street Public school 3 The sum of 100 per annum to Mr Late engaged in giving religiously struction the Public schools within the rural Deanery of Camele n Mr I atty visits eight schools, containing in all 200 children. He pays eleven or twelve visits in the week, tru elling for this purpose upwards of 100 miles Grants are not made by the committee until the diocesan inspector of schools has certified to the qualifications of the teacher proposed In December, 1884, the Bishop, by a circular letter addressed to the clergy, requested information as to the number of Public schools within their respective parishes, and the practice of religious instruction given weekly in each school The returns received in reply will be found tabulated in Appendix. (B It will be seen that religious instruction is being given regularly in 95 schools, and that 62 schools are altogether without such instruction In the case of 29 of these latter schools, the want of a class- room is alleged as an obstacle Two public meetings have been held in furtherance of the objects of the committee. The first of these was held in the Masonic Hall on August 10 and thepioicpomgsi* carefully reported in the daily papers The second we behold in the C ity Mission Chapel, Sussex-street, on December 2 A series of similar meetings, to be held in various city and suburban pun he, was projected by the committee but a difficulty was found to exist in the fear entertained by some of those locally concerned that such a plan might tend to injure existing Denomination ii schools In conclusion, the committee feel that the future success or otherwise of this may emerge ill very largely depend upon the way in a which the subject may be dealt with by the Synod Hither to the difficulties of the question have been aggravated by the unsettled condition of the relations between the State and the Denominational schools The recent settlement of those relations hits at least left the ground more clear for united and vigorous action in the direction of giving efficient religious instruc- tion in the Pul lie- schools -W ILII vast M Coy i ER, chairman " Mr Sharp regretted that a more satisfactory report could not be submitted A great deal of feeling had been exhibited in reference to this matter, and the outcome had been subscriptions to the amount of something like £100 It the people of the Church of England felt strongly upon the subject they had a peculiar way of showing it There was howey cr a very substantial guyra of comfort rather fact that religious instruction was being given in so many Public schools The Rev E G HODGSON seconded the motion. Mr. A GORDON pointed out that there was evidently work to be done when there were eighty-two schools which were altogether without religious rash action The fact, however, that there were ninety-six schools in which such instruction was given proved that there was a willingness on the part of the clergy to do their work if the laity would do their work Mr Gordon stated that, as a member of a school Bond, he had had to visit seven large schools, two of which were Church of England Denominational, two Roman Catholic Denominational, and three Public schools He bore his hearty testimony to the efficient manner in which the Roman Catholic schools were conducted so far as religious instruction was concerned, and in that respect they were a bright example of the Church of England schools with regard to the Public schools the tale told by the teachers was always the same that there was a great of work for the Church of England clergy in those schools The teachers did all they could to impress intellectual and moral lessons upon the children under their charge, and he was prepared to say that the teachers in those schools, so far as he could judge from circumstances which came under his knowledge, in visiting the schools, over as earnestly man and women could beininstnictmfr rightly the children under their charge. They would welcome systematic and religious instruction by the clergy of any religious body (Hear, hear.) Mr. G T COLLINS thought it was now a question for the laity of the Church of England whether they would retain the Public Instruction Act of 1880 intact, or whether by their indifference, they would call into existence an Act similar to that in force in Victoria (Hear, hear.) It then did not take advantage of the religious clauses in the existing Act, the time would not be far distant when the pnviJeDf-s which those clauses afforded would be taken a way from them. He recommended that the members of the various school Boards should be coramiraicatcl with All the members of the Board to which he belonged were at one upon this question of religious instruction and he believed that the members of many of the Board might be led to actively interest themselves in the matter (He or, hear ) Mr. E W Mon soo ouric suggested that a more systematic effort should be made in the collection subscriptions for this good work (Cheers) The PRESIDENT (as chairman of the committee) stated that GOO circulars had been sent to the laity soliciting support and nothing had come back The Rev. J. LVUN i m endorsed Mr Collins' remarks that if the members of the Church of England did not take full advantage of the pmilegcsafforded by the existing Act, they won Id lose those advantages altogether The Rev T B TRESS thought that, as there were thousands who never gave anything to support the work of the Church a sy tematic effort should be made to draw our pecuniary support in this work there was a great want of classrooms in connection with the Public schools, and which prevented religious instruction being given more frequently and conveniently There was also a want of or" inaction in the parishes to secure the effectual carrying out of this work Mr Li II LU said that in the neighbouring colony of ?y actor i it was notorious that one of the principal reasons which led to the passing, of the present Education Act in Victoria was the failure of the Churches to take advantage of the privileges they were afforded under the previous Education Act in the diocese of Melbourne they would at the present moment be glad of the privilege that we enjoy in this colony under our present Public Instruction Act (Hear, hear) The Rev J I MOR V-E was certain that if the the clergy would awake to their proper responsibilities in this matter a great and good work would be done in the Public schools He attributed the increase of larrikinism to the decrease of religious instruction in schools The Rev A W PUN anticipated a great deal of good from this discussion If there had been any despondency in regard to this report it was because there had not been shown that amount of outside interest that was anticipated (Hear hear ) The committee had done their work, and would have been glad to have availed themselves of salaried the others in the performance of this work, but they had not been able to act upon that idea cause they did not have the salary. It had been said that men of b and could not be found to perform this work for the remuneration offered and in reference to that he desired to ment on an instance in the district of Camden Mr Latty had been engaged giving religious instruction to 200 children in the rural Deanery of Camden had maintained his own horse , spent nine hours a day in his work, and rode 116 miles a week in the performance of that work, and all this for 26s per annum (Hear, hear.) He did not think, however, that Mr Latty could be asked to continue to perform that work for £60 a year (Hear, hear.) It had been shown that under the present Public Instruction Act religious instruction could be given in the Public schools, and he hoped that it would be given more largely in the future than in the past (Hear, hear.) He recommended the employment of young men now engaged in Sunday-school duties, who might be induced to take up this work as their business in life, not to supersede but to supplement the labours of the clergy in connection with the Public schools Mr H S BOND moved, as an amendment, that the resolution of which he had given notice should be added to the motion, viz " That as Denominational schools decrease in number, it is hoped that the clergy and laity will give more attention to the religious education of the young than when both Denominational and Public schools had to be attended " It was suggested that the addendum close at the word attended and the suggestion was adopted The Rev R E _Evn? second the amendment. He pointed out that in some of the parties it was absolutely impossible for the whole of the Public schools to be visited by the clergyman of each district In one parish, for instance, there were 18 schools, and the clergyman of that parish could only visit two each week He observed that in nearly all the parishes instruction was given in the Public schools and in those parishes where such instruction was not given the reason was that the schools were too numerous or the parish too large The Rev J W DEBENHAM hope that some authoritative decision should be given on the subject of class rooms It had already been publicly stated that the clergyman of the Broughton Creek district had been refused permission to instruct the children in the Public school in his district, and the Minister had been appealed to in vain He (Mr. Debenham) had had a similar experience, and in other parishes the greatest difficulty existed because there were no separate class rooms in which the children could be taken to receive religious instruction The Rev Mr PAIN explained that where there was no class room in the school, and there was a neighbouring building such as a church available, the department permitted the withdrawal of the children to that building for temporary religious instruction Mr T J JACQUES pointed out that in one respect the report was liable to misinterpretation Although there were 62 schools in which Church of England clergymen did not give religious instruction, the Legislature should not suppose that those schools were altogether without religious instruc- tion Mr W A BRODRIBB strongly urged upon the Synod to take active steps to raise funds He believed that if a special personal effort were made, hundreds of pounds would promptly be obtained (Hear, hear.) Mr. W J FOSTER supported Mr Brodnbb'ssuggestion. The Roy Air HOL Gil suggested that a paid canvasser should be employed to secure subscription-, The PiiLaiJJKST said that if funds were not forthcoming the work of the committee would speedily have to cease. He thought that good work might be done by the employment of paid agents He knew of two young men quite eligible for the duties, one of whom had had some little training in a Public school already What the promoters really did want was fund--, and in some way they must apply to the laity of the Church With regard to the advantages that were said to arise from religious instruction in Public schools, he had the testimony of the master of the Sussex-street Public school, that sizes religious instruction had been given in that school the most marked improvement in the school had taken place. The question of class rooms was a most important one He did not know how religious instruction was to be given unless something was done to provide class-rooms Even at Port sheet the want of accommodation was most seriously felt, and the same he supposed, was the case with some other large schools in or about Sydney With regard to the country must acts the same difficulty presented itself The clergymen in those districts could not always attend to the schools, which were scattered over large tracts of country He hoped that the discussion would be productive of good, and that the result would be a large amount of pecuniary support, which would enable the committee to employ catechists, and enlist such aid as would enable them to carry on their business more effectively (Hear hear ) Archdeacon RING stated that, although a clergyman might visit a school once a week every child might not receive religious instruction more than once in three weeks. The Rev Mr SHAI-I having forged and intimated his intention of accepting the amendment, the motion was unanimously agreed to in its amended form CHURCH BILL VL Mr H S S BOND moved - ' Unit our cathedral should be a pattern to all churches, especially in the exact observance of the rubric of our Pray er Book and although the Australian Church may not be bound to obey the canons of Canterbury, England, of the of dear IPO 1 it is desirable that in our Cathedral the 22nd canon should be observed as to the setting up of the len Comm moments on the east end of every church and chapel, where the people may best see and read the same and other chosen sentences written upon the walls of these 1 churches and chapels in places convenient " Bli COLLIN t, seconded the motion After some discussion attention was called to the fact that there was not a quorum present, and the Synod adjourned at 10 40 p.m. till 3 30 p m to day -
