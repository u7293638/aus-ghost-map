MR. CRESWICK IN ' HAMLET. Despite the inclemency of the weather on Saturday evening, the Victoria Theatre was crowded, upon the occasion of" Mr Creswick making his first appearance in the character of Hamlet No Shakspearian drama is so familiar to the play-going public in the colony, and none so (great a favourite The actor now-a-days puts himself under the pale of public criticism more essentially in Hamlet than almost any other play extant, from the fact that, as far as Sydney is concerned, the exponents of the role, good, bad, and indifferent, have been legion In Mr Creswick's representation we have no attempt made at innovation or specialty, no particular treatment to mark the actor as excelling in one peculiar phase of the character of Hamlet, but a scholarly reading of the whole of the text, a thorough individuality throughout and an evenness of rendition so on mploto that it is impossible, as far as dealing with Mr Creswick's treatment is concerned, to specially singled out one particular s ease in which he up pears of more marked excellence than another Treating the madness of Hamlet as simulated from the point where horror stricken at the- revelation made him by the spectre of his father that the latter had been foully murdered, he partially reveals to Horatio and Marcellus his plan for re- venge and swears thorn to secrecy , it is then he points out their line of action and his own Â» * .

Am I then revenged To take him in the pursing of his soul, XV ben he is in and season d for the his age? No " Mr Creswick delivers the passage not only with the sudden decision of purpose suggested by the text, but with a peculiar force that portrays the inward struggle in Hamlet's mind, as to whether such a sudden dispatch would mete out 11s amount of justice the shade of his father had made him promise ' If thou did it ever thy dear father love, Here out his foul and most unnatural murder ' is a request made as if Hamlet's love for his father should be the mainspring of all the machinery he employs to avenue his murder, and that the usurpation of the throne and the incestuous marriage of his mother, however detest- able in the light of the means whereby they are attained, should not spur him so much to vengeance as reverence for his father s memory There is therefore an innate tenderness of affection for his dead father which is perpetually unnerving Hamlet, and against which he is constantly struggling, lest the consummation of his vengeance should not be completed. It is this phase of character that Mr Creswick so effectively gives expression to Hamlet becomes in his hands not the enraged man who is perpetually brought before us as thirsting to gratify his hatred by the ruin of his uncle but no one brooding over a great sorrow and when, in pourtraying all this he has to hoodwink and battle those about him by simulating madness, and effect it so completely, it may indeed be said that the conception of the character 13 as complete as its delineation is in the highest possible way artistic Objections have been taken, and perhaps with con | siderable show of reason, to the somewhat stingy manner in which Mr Creswick has treated the colloquial parts of the dialogues mother dramas he has appeared in, but perhaps one of the most effective passages he delivered, in the representation under notice, was the ironical rebuff to Guilden stern when Hamlet draws the simile between himself and the flute he hands the former to play upon "Do you think I am easier to be played upon than a pure Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon it'" This passage Mr Creswick delivered not as a piece of declamation, as is the habit of too many impersonators of the character, nor indeed as if it were the cunning of a madman, but as a piece of bitter irony, and with telling effect So also with the interview with the players and his advice to them, his phraseology does not rise beyond ordinary colloquialism, but it was delivered with pungency and marked emphasis in such striking contrast to the stormy scene with Ophelia, where madness in its wildest form he has just typifies, that the subtlety of the acting was perhaps more marked than in any other part of the drama In a word, it is in the minor details where the masterly conception of the character of Hamlet is exemplified at a harmonious one throughout There is no playing up to a sensational climax. no despising of small things to save physical power for some strong dramatic position 'The evenness of the rendition and its essential individuality are its main characteristics and though in a play which runs well nigh for four hours, it is impossible to take in all the beauties at one representa- tion as particularly brought out by an actor whose lengthened performance is under renewal, it is sufficient to say that Mr Creswick's Hamlet is a profound psychological study In completeness it may well have been correctly termed unrivalled, and, as a faithful interpretation of the author, faultless What weakness there may possibly be found is in reality strength for, although in the more tender scenes with Ophelia, the freshness of youth may be wanting, still, on the other hand, we have in the more philosophical parts of the drama the exhibition of all that is refined, delicate, and subtle in detail which is not to be rendered by anyone who has not made the character the stud., of years, and brought a rare amount of intellect to enable such a perfect delinea- tion to be attained Of the other characters in the drama it would, in most cases, be somewhat unfair to speak on a first representation, especially one which was so long and so particularly trying Although the performance commenced punctually at a quarter to 8, and no time was lost between the scones, if did not conclude until half-past 11 The play abounds with long soliloquies and speeches, and in many cases they were given so slowly, though very carefully, that they became somewhat wearisome The performance needs shortening, and probably the manage ment will see their way clear to effect this on subsequent representations otherwise the last act will lose much of its effect, as it did on Saturday evening, by numbers of the audience leaving before it is concluded Miss Ashton's Ophelia deserves special notice for its doth cacy and gracefulness In the mad scene she was particularly effective, and those painfully plaintive snatches of quaint duties she sings as she in her disordered fancy strews her father 's gray 6 with flowers were most touchingly given Mrs Belton is rather overweighted with the character of the Queen and her you e is rather against her, but nevertheless she spared no pains to give the character an intelligent reading Mr Carey, as the ghost was sepulchral enough in his delivery of the speech to Hamlet, but why it should be necessary to use this charnel-house mode of delivery simply because the speech is that of a ghost is not very easy to understand Mr Carey delivered it too much in monotone and it lost much of its effect Mr Jones was a c pital Polonius but it struck us that he dressed the part father tupiitriareballv Mr Bartlett, moreover, perfect as he was in the part of the First Actor was somewhat eccentric in his make-up, which does not suit his figure Mr Douglas was better as I senses than in many characters he has played lately and acted with much spirit Mr "Seagrave's King is worthy of notice, though be, perhaps, erred more than his colleagues in slowness of delivery, at times being tedious Mr Bland Holt's Grave digger is well known, and was played admirably Air Metcalfe and Mr Bolton, as Horatio and Marcellus respectively, deserve a good word for their careful playing The latter, indeed, is to be complimented on his clear elocution, which shows marked improvement during the last few weeks As regards the text therein party could not have been more perfect, and the stiffness which was so noticeable occasionally on Saturday, arising plainly from over-anxiety, will no doubt disappear upon a second representation, when further reference may be more fairly made to many excellences noticeable in the subordinate characters. The mounting of the piece was admirable, and the group- ing artistic. Special notice may be made of the ghost scene, as also of all those in the palace, which were well set. The piece will be repeated every night until further notice.
