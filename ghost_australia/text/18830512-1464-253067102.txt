A Modern Miracle. MHE goose that laid the golden eggs has had her day, and must yPJ now take a back seat until she strikes another reef, as the Pine- T? ville correspondent of a Northern journal has recently sent A along the following most extraordinary statement: — "It is V popularly supposed that hens only lay one egg per day. Mrs. Blank, of this district, however, has one which is an exception to this rule, and which fairly bids defiance to one of the most generally accepted of Nature's laws. Last Sunday she laid two." What? — two of Nature's laws? That'll puzzle Denton. — Ed. S. P. "The strangest thing about this matter is they were two perfect eggs, with separate shells and yolks. One was smaller than the other, and the smaller one was inside the larger one,1" lar ! Strange times are settling on the laud. Mrs. Julius Caasar once declared a lioness whelped in the streets of Borne, graves yawn'd, fiery warriors "fit" in the clouds, and ghosts did squawk and scoot about the pathways ; but what are these paltry foolishments when compared with the Pineville " chookie" that actually laid a " smaller egg inside a larger one. All she has to do now is to lay a larger egg inside a smaller one, and then she will be entitled to a State pension and a first-class vote under Dan O'Con nor's new Female Suffrage Clause. A Blackfellow. at Brewarrina, was accused of murdering his gin and was acquitted. It seems fair. Our publicans murder their rum and we don't even prosecute.
