i Theatricals in England... '' A Correspondent writing' from London at the ' latter end of February last, is | responsible for- the following — " L- am ! amused, but not greatly surprised, .toy r learn that theatrical folk are beginning to respect ana even iear ine critical faculty of .Australasian audiences!; L A successful aotor-mannger. . the other., evening, 1 thought talked a good deal 1 of sense' about Golonial tlieatrergo'ers;" -) ".Youkpow,"..he_8aid,.." they. (moan-. ing Ooipnial theatre-goers) are not half ' as ready -to take European: ' star- ' on trust as they were. Many times over- they have been grossly- deceived ; that is called . upon to pay high prices for and accept as first- class, performances' that- were mere ghosts of the past;' 1 Ristori, Creswick, and Boucicault never thought of visiting Australia till they had -worked- -their— reputations- / pretty well to death in Europe and the States, and it' they didn't; ' lag. 'super fluous on the stage ' ; were at least ) conscious of a falling off in receipts, and the necessity of seeking fresh fields'wherea great reputation would" s cover a multitude of weaknesses." ... I went to the Vaudeville the other s, nightto see "Plebeians, "Mr. Derrick's ' newebmedy— a;;yery poor affair coih- ( pared with " Confusion." At the end of the "performance' I had not much s notion of the plot, save that two delightfully improbable "self-mads" ' fathers kept offering an impecunious ( aristocrat (the Hon. Danby Qleve) / £15,000 and £25,000 to marry their respective daughters. Towards ,the ( close of the third act Danby , having y led everyone to suppose; he meant to \ wed an impecunious governess, f selected the lady with £25,000. A" ) lover believedvto he drowned at sea, S then turned J. up . ''to console the ( governess, and down came the curtain. ) "Plebeians " will never get as far as New Zealand.
