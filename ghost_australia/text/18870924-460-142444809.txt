ORIGINAL POETRY. SAMPER FIDELIS. Make 1110 no vows of oonstancy, dear friend— To lovo iuc though f die—thy whole life long, And lore no other till thy days shall end ; h'aj', it were rash and wrong. If thou canst love another, be it so ? I would not reaoh out of ray quiet grave <Xo bind thy heart if it should choose To go. hove shall not be a slave. •My placid ghost, Itrust, will walk serene ' f Tn clearer light than gilds theso earthly morns, £ Above the jealousies and envies keen Which sow this life with thorn*. Thou would'st not feel air shadowy caress If, after death, my soul should linger here; Honv hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully ■ That thou avert waiting all thy life in woe For my poor sake; what love thou hast for me Bestow it ere I go. Carre not uj>on a stone wiien I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To woman's grace—a tardy recompense— But speak them while I live. Heap not the heavy marble On my. head To shut away the sunshine and the den'; let small blooms grow there, and the grasses .ware And raindrops filter through. ' Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay ' Than I, hut trust me, thou canst never find One who will love and serve thee night and day With a more single mlig). £| , Forget are when I die; the violets . Above my rest will blossom just as blue, tubs thy tears—ev'n* Katun's self forgets— t while I live be true. ATHA.
