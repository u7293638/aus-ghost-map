MR. AND MRS. CHARLES KEAN. I \- 9 As Mr and Mrs. Charles Kean are to appear at the Prince of Wales Theatre on Wednesday evening next, the following biography, condensed from the European Times, will prove interesting to our readers, giving as it does a very complete history, not only of their professional career, but of many circumstances connected with the high position they held in English society - Educated at Eton among the aristocracy of the land, in any of whom still delight to speak of him as one of the thief woman men of the college, Charles Kean was encouraged to indulge in various dreams of future greatness His mother hoped that he would be a luminary of the Church his father designed him for the navy, he himself was anxious to earn laurels by a career of military glory. No one ever thought of him in connection with the stage It is needless to dwell on the foibles of the late Mr Edmund Kean Like many men endowed with, lofty (emus he lacked the Household virtue, prudence and the n material sums which had nourished the hopes of the young Etonian were suddenly withdrawn Edmund Kean had received more money than any actor since Garrick, in. the some time, and his son Charles had every right to believe that whatever path to future eminence he selected he would tread it, not be an humble aspirant, but as the heir to a considerable fortune It was decreed otherwise In the midst of his promising career at Eton he was suddenly summoned to London, where he learned that he must rely on his own resources Without going into unnecessary details, we may here clscrvothit the chance in Charles Kean s prospects was partly owing to his own high sense of duty He was ( to rid a cadetship in India which might have been the beginning of a life of glory, but the acceptance of the offer would have necessitated a separation from his m author who was completely bedridden and had no one but him to rely upon Ambition and Filial Duty called him in opposite directions he obeyed the holder voice and chose the theatrical profession not from inclination, but because it best enabled him to perform the offices of a devoted Bjn The portion of Charles Kean and his mother in those dark days in so interesting, that we may quote the testimony of an eye witness of their early struggles to the deep entreaty) that existed between them " Edmund Kean was blessed with a simple minded devoted wife, whom he, unhappily), never appreciated She was for ever BOrrowEd over and forgiving his irregularities, and for ever instilling into their young son principles of honour, justice, and truth, in the endeavour to protect him hereafter from those vices which eventually ruined the father The soil was good, and the seed she showed grow fast and strong, and amply she was repaid for her Christian motherly care I knew them when they were poor and I earl) fr'eudlcsB, and when she had no comfort in life but him her health was broken by domestic misfortunes she was almost a cripple, and in constant bodily suffering He was the light of her life, her food, her joy, her all, and her helpless state was to him a sort of balance to his youth His devotion to her made him a thoughtful boy, and filled his heart with honest ambition she was a true Irish- woman, in the most pleasing sense of the term Her heart was open as the day, and she was liberal to a fault All her ideas were large, and the other son imbibed If genius is hereditary, we may eat pose that Charles Kean took his genius from his father but the high tone of his mind, his strict sense of justice, his truth and nobility of soul, all sprung from his mother ' tJe may pass over the career of Mr Charles Kean in London and the p evinces as juvenile actor. Once affecting incident may, however, be mentioned, namely, a meeting with his father in Scotland, and their appearance together, at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, as Luittis and his son Titus, in Howard Payne a tragedy The last time (and the only time in London) that they acted together was at Covent Garden, in the tragedy of ' Othello, ' when The Moor was played by Edmund Kean, lago by his son Charles, and Desdemona by Miss Ellen area, now Mrs Charles Kean At the end! of the celebrated "Farewell" speech, in the third act Edmund Kean s strength filled, he was borne almost like a from the stage, and died a few weeks of ten aide The first period of Mr Charles Kean's professional trip is terminated by a visit to America, where he remained three years, sending home to his mother liberal remittances which were rendered doubly welcome to her by the knowledge that it was the unmistakable evidence of the advance he was making in his profession that enabled him to do so. On his return to the English capital, he was engaged at Covent Garden A career that would have Batislud one who was It so conscious of his high mission was now clear before him, but he retired into the prov meet, resolved not to let his foot again on a London since, till he could make his own terms. An amusing story (the authenticity of which may be relied on is told in connection with this resolution shortly after the termination of the Covent Garden season young Kean accidentally met Mr Dunn, the treasure.- of Drury lane Theatre, who told him that in all probability he could obtain an engagement at that hour with a salary of salt per week. " No," was the reply , " I will never again set my foot on a London stage, until 1 command 170 per night " Then," answered Mr Dunn, shaking him vehemently by the hand, "Good bye, my dear boy, for I shall never see you act again in London " in the great towns of the sister kingdom and in the provinces his genius was speedily acknowledged. At Ld nburgh alone, where he played Hamlet for twelve nights he gained £1-00 in four-week, and at Dublin, M mchester, Liverpool, Birmingham Brigutjn, Plymouth, Exeter, Vic , he successively became an object of universal admiration Waterford, it should be observed, was the place of his birth, and the Irish were especially prominent in doing honour to their young c untr}inan At the city of W Waterford a public dinner was given to him, and he was presented with a silver claret jug, worth £100 At the end of 1837 the summit of his ambition was at length attained The manager of Drury-lane I theatre offered him an engagement of twenty nights, at £60 per night, and Mr Dunn, the prophet of evil, was the very man to pay it On the 8th January), 1858, he appeared in his great character of Hamlet To this point the history has been one of struggles and aspirations , henceforth we favours) to chronicle an uninterrupted series of victorian 1 he 8th of January, 1835, was a day destined long to hold a place in the theatrical calendar The Ha inlet of Mr Charles Kean, played before a crowded and expectant audience, proved triumphantly successful, and the great tragedian might rest assured that henceforward the public would be in his grasp The Innes newspaper of that day on nounced the representation to be " an elegant and Intellectual performance Charles Kean's Hamlet" is a performance which now every English gentleman is supposed to have seen, as a matter of course and the reappearance of that great actor in that prominent character is always regarded in London as a sort of theatrical festival Hamlet was followed by Puhaul, Millard by Sir Giles Of try each the engagement for three) nights was extended to forty three, and in its course upwards of £13,000 was received by the manager A public dinner, which was given in the saloon of the theatre, under the presidency of the Earl of Carlisle, and at which an elegant vase, worth £200 was presented to Mr Charles Kean, was the supplementary honour to this great triumph A hero is a curious fact related by Alfred B unn in his History of the stage, that the receipts during Mr. Charles Kean's engagement at Drury, Lane, in the winter of 1938, after making allowance for the differences of prices, ware, within a fraction, equal to those received in 1914, for the same number of nights, when his gifted father first appeared at the same t h nairn It was on the 20th of January, 1842 that the marriage of Mr Charles Kean and Miss Ellen Tree took place at Dublin, where the accomplished pair had just completed an engagement Of all the scenes in the great trade dian's like this was the wisest and the most fortunate. Miss Ellen Tree was at the head of her profession both in tragedy and high comedy, she had frequently been associated with him in his career to eminence, and was one of the performers in Othello" on that memorable night when the elder Kean may almost be said to have died on the stope In the last year at the Haymarket, prior to the Dublin engagement, she had played Juliet to Charles Kean's To need for more than twenty successive nights. Something like a destiny seemed to promote the union of Charles Kean and Ellen Tree, and if such were the case, this destiny certainly was most benefi- cent Of the invaluable aid that Mrs Kean has afforded her husband, as the leading actress in most of his plays, and as his chief assistant in the arduous management of the Princess' Theatre all London is aware More than that, the domestic happiness of this gifted couple is known to the best circles throughout the United Kingdom, and the social position of Mr. and Mrs Charles Kean is as universally recognised as their pre-eminence in the highest class of drama An engagement at the Haymarket in the summer of 1842, an engagement at Drury- lane the following winter, a provincial tour, and a visit to America, brings us to the middle of 1817, when the second act of our drama may be said to close, leaving Charles Kean a husband and a father. When in January, 1915, they reappeared at the Haymarket, after on at once from London of four years, they fund a public ready to receive them with acclamation. The first piece they appeared in was Mr Lovell's play, the " V life's Secret," which drew crowded houses for no less than thirty-six morals In December, 1848, commenced an important epoch in the history of the stage. Ever since the accession of her present Majesty to the throne the English theatres have been greatly patronised by Royalty ; but this was not the case during the interval that separates the present reign from that of George III. Both George IV. and William IV. were advanced in years when they assumed the diadem, and were neither of them expected to be present at any public amusement. Queen Victoria not only paid Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean the extraordinary compliment of being present at their benefit on the 3rd of July, 1848, when the "Wife's Secret" was played for the thirty-seventh time, but she appointed him her director of the private theatrical performances at Windsor Castle. Such a marked sanction of theatrical art by Royalty had not been known for many years, and there is no doubt that the Windsor performances were of incalculable use In banishing the prejudice which had long been entertained against the theatrical profession, in spite of the many other famous names with which it was associated. At the conclusion of the first season of the Windsor theatricals, her Majesty honoured Mr. Charles Kean with a personal interview, and afterwards presented him with a diamond ring. For ten years he held this high and hon , ourable office-for ten years did he reap a harvest of golden opinions among the good and great whom the Windsor festivities attracted to the Home of Royalty The mother of Mr Charles Kean is too interesting a personage in his biography for her death to be passed over without record During the latter period of her life she had resided at Keydell, a pleasant retreat in Hampshire, which Mr Kean had purchased shortly after his marriage, as a place of occasional retirement from the toils and troubles of his vocation She died in March 1840 and as he bIwhjb thought of her while living, so did he honour her when life was no more A handsome tomb in the churchyard of Cathorington, near Keydell, records her last resting-place The importance of the event we are now about to record, and which opened another act in our biographical drama can so arcely be appreciated by anyone who is not less thy acquainted with the state of the London stage in 1850 The two large theatres patented for the encouragement of drama no literature and art and for many years been constantly perverted from the high sea for which they had been erected, and their exclusive privileges had been virtually cancelled Covent Garden, the home of the Kimbles, wish, as it is now, an ital an Opera House, Drury Lane, the home of Garrick and Edmund Kean was sometimes an opera sometimes a plavheiUEe, sometimes an equestrian circus as chance directed The small theatre in the Haymarket, though occasionally used for the performance of tragedy, is essentially a house for prose comedy. IhuB, in 1850 there was literally co edifice devoted to the performance of the political drama, Have in a remote suburb ignored by the fashionable classes in becoming a manager, Mr Charles Kean had really to do the work of a colonist He was in the land of Shakspere, in the country which boasts of its dramatic literature, but in the capital of which the drama was not Had he consulted no interest but his own Mr C hatlis Kean might have let things remain just as they were, satisfied that all the managers of the United Kingdom would gladly throw open their doors at the approach of the great tragedian, and that granting the duration of health and Birt noth he might go on fulfilling star engage n ents to his life's end and thus realise a prin ely fortune without responsibility or care The notion that the stage is a mere source of frivolous in usement never crossed the mind of Charles Kean in- due tuously as it is promulgate 1, not only by the enemies of the theatre, but by the great body of modern dramatists. to use the Duke of Newcastle's words, spoken at the great " Keon banquet" of 1859, he is " one whose zeal in his profession, amounting almost to enthusiasm, has led him to prove that the theatre may be made not merely the vehicle for frivolous amusement, or, what is worse, for dissipation, but that it may be erected into a gigantic instrument of education for the instruction of the young and for health cities as well as amusement of those of maturer age " During one of his visits to America, and in the course of an engagement at the Haymarket, he had already shown a great desire to become a reformer of costume and other details of stage representation , but it was not until he had a theatre of his own that he could prove himself to be, in the words of the Duke's speech, ' one of the greatest our geologists of the day, making the stage not only a v thiele for dramatic poetry, but a school of history." The fence of Mr Kean's management of the Princess's Theatre commenced towards the end of 1859 The first play produced were "Hamlet" and "Twelfth Night, but not until early in 1852 began that series of "revivals," the fame of which has been spread over the whole civilised world From this time every season was marked by the revival of some great play, which riveted the attention of every class in London and attracted visitors from the remotest provinces of England, and even from the Continent. A writer in the Art Journal, the principal periodical of the class, thus speaks in reference to one of the great "revivals." and to Mr. Kean's honest declaration that accuracy, not show, had been his object " Ihtsistrue to an extent that not one man of the thousands who crowded his theatre can entirely appreciate Many of the hundreds would have been ob- well satisfied to have seen real armour of one fashion as of another It is Mr Kean's merit to despise no unsound which can give vitality to his fame and the antiquary who would go simply to judge his work by his own branch of study would find that each portion of the appointments of the drama had been correctly cared for Mr Charles Kean, however, had far too artistic a mind to confound the importance of the principal figures and the accessories in a work of art. It was as an actor that he had acquired the means which enabled him to become an area geological instructor, and the genius proper to his oripLal vocation was always in the foreground. Nay, it is worthy of remark that " Louis XI in the piece which was brought out with less decoration than any placed on the above list, was at once hailed as a theatrical miracle, on account of his acting alone, and still remains one of the most attractive works associated with his name Had he been less ardent in the garrison of knowledge, had he been content to rely only on the histrionic talent of himself and his vii p using only such accessories as were consistent with the most rigid spirit of economy, there is no doubt that his management of the Princes- s Theatre would have been a much more profitable speculation than was actually the case for no receipts, however large, could more than slightly exceed his princely expenditure. since their retirement from the management of the Prince's' Theatre, Mr and Mrs O Kean have stood alone in their histrionic grandeur, without the aid of a highly finished background and the great play?, quietly sued, drew multitudes whenever they go ' Hamlet,' ' Othello," ' Macbeth,' " The Merchant of "a race " Louis XI in ' Much Ado about Nothing," " The A\ life e Secret,' and " i be Gamester," played at any house in the united Kingdom, are sure to attract crowds when the Keans" play the principal characters xv o have spoken i of Mr Kean as a master of his off the river who in the midst of his popularity and in the meridian of his powers, has been thought worthy of those horrors that are usually reserved to decorate the close of a Inlhant career Eton availed herself of his retirement from the arduous post of manager to manifest ter appreciation of his genius, and her admiration of hiSEiotleEs life, by the most sumptuous banquet that was ever given in honour of an actor Who that witnessed it can ever forget that scene, where upwards of GOO gentlemen, including Cabinet ministers, privy councillors, and the representatives of our two great seats of learning, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, presided over by the Late of Newcastle, assembled in St James's Hall to do honour to Charles Kean " Eton, aided by the public, presented to Mr Kean that magnificent piece, or rather sundry pieces of plete, fashioned in the highest style of art, valued at 2000 guineas, which were amongst the most conspicuous objects of the late International Exhibition in. Those were memorials of which the highest in the realm, who had won eminence in the councils or laurels in the field, might well be proud To Mr Kean they must be most honourable and dear, when he is assured that they are Boma acknowledgment of his great deserts and of the high esteem in which he is held by his countrymen I All great men, however high their vocation, must consult, in some degree, the spirit of the age into which they are born While the Princess's theatre was essentially devoted to the representation of the works of the national poet ere long season (1856 7) of 200 nights not less than 212 were consecrated to Shakespeare-Mr. Charles Kean perceived that the public occasional! v required recreation of a lighter kind, and he produced a few works of the melo- dramatic order such as " The Corsican Brothers," ' Pauline," 'Faust and Marguerita " and " the Courier cyclone" Even when he produced pieces of the least elevating class, Mr Charles Kean was at pains not to create, but to refine. The "Corsican Brothers," with Mr Kean as the mysterious twins, was the very best of theatrical ghost stones Through Mr Kean's line acting, and the perfect manner in which the drama was put upon the stage, it achieved the extraordinary run of nearly three hundred nights In summing up all that has been done for the stage by Mr. Charles Kean, durmghisnianagementof the Princess's Theatre we may refer to the speech of his illustrious school- fellow the Chancellor of the Exchequer, delivered at the great Kean Banquet in 1859 ' le m render witness to Mr Kean,' said Mr Gladstone, as being a public lane victor. If any thing could add tone) individual satisfaction in rendering that witness, it would be the circumstance that I am poll reaDy connected b) representative, and have for years been connected, with one of the great seats of learning and education in England I see in our time one of those who here averted the social brotherhood that exists between all true and genuine instrument of human cultivation He has said truly that in the drama the greatest powers of the human mind have been exhibited, this most influential instrument which has sometimes grovelled in the mire, and which has rarely been appreciated to the extent of its capacity, Mr Keon has devoted almost immeasurable labour by raising up to its due and natural elevation This is theories that he has conferred upon the age." The silver service to which we have already referred, was presented in St James' Hall, March, 1863, at a public meeting, presided over by Mr Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the centre-piece bears the following inscription To CHARLEs JohN Kfan, F.S.A., ' By many fellow Etonians, together with numerous friends and Admirers among the Public, As a tribute to the Genius of a Great Actor, And in recognition of his unremitting efforts to improve the tone and elevate the character of the British Stage. Match 22nd, 1862. While Mr. Charles Kean was on the high road towards the attainment of honours that had never before been awarded to any member of his profession, he did not forget the dictates of humanity. His early training and early struggles had opened his heart to charity, and when his days of prosperity arrived he did not forget that he had once been poor. In the autumn of 1852 the husband of Mrs. Kean's youngest sister died, leaving his widow with eleven children utterly unprovided for. Stand forth, ye orphans, and lift your voices high in gratitude to him who took upon himself the duties of a father-to him who educated, cherished, and supported you, and gave to the world as bright an example of Christian feeling ! The reasons for Mr. Kean's retirement from management were briefly expressed by himself when, on the 29th August, 1859, he took leave of the London public in his managerial character. " I need not deny he said, " that I have had no gains in a commercial sense. More restricted notions and a more parsimonious outlay might,! perhaps, have led to a very different result ; but I could not be induced by such considerations to check my desire to do what he considered right, and what would, In my opinion, advance the best interest of my profession. Whatever loss I have sustained I Ia amply compensated by the praise you have bestowed up on my efforts. Mind and body require rest a (ter such active exercise for nine years, and it could not be a matter of surprise if I sank under a continuance of the combined duties of actor and manager of a theatre where every thing has grown into such gigantic proportions Inde d I should long since have succumbed had not been sustained and seconded by the indomitable energy and devoted affection of my wife You have only seen her in the fulfil- ment of her professional pursuits, and are therefore unable to estimate the value of her as istance and counsel She was ever tyme side in the hour of need, ready to revive my drooping spirits and to stimulate me to fresh exertions " Though relieved from the responsibility and toils of management Mr and Mrs Kean have rested but little. Constantly fulfilling provincial engagements, which have compelled them to visit nearly all the great towns in the Three Kingdoms and paying at least once a year a visit to London, where they are always expected with eagerness scr d welcomed with delight thus they continue their useful toil, while everybody marvel at their never failing energy and vigour While they remained at the Princess's Theatre, during the season of last year, they played ' Henry VIII " for no less than eighty nights, without interruption In the olden time this dramatic, ' history" was not one of the most attractive of Shakspeare's works ; but the characters of the Cardinal and the Queen are so will adapted to Mr and Mrs Charles Kean, that the radio is now us universally secular as Hamlet" or "Othello" The farewell engagement at the Princess's this year, occupying the first half of May, was the cause of an immense excitement The feeling with which this was generally regarded cannot better be expressed than in the words of that most particular and intellectual of journals, the saturday Jlcaciv - When our great tragedian troops) retired to the pro vmcBf, he did not altogether slip out of sight We always heard Low he was going on, and his return to London for a few weeks always seemed to be an event within the range of possibility) But when Mr. Charles Kerr is at Melbourne or -vdney, when awaited was in separates him from this 1 rich Islands, the drawbridge is raised with a vengeance, and the chains that keep it up are secured with the strangest stories Nothing will be left to remind the public of the higher uses for which a the-stra can be employed Prose dramas of the light kind, whether serious or coat it will alone be presented. Plays will be looked upon as amusements with which the intellect has little or nothing to do. that is to pay if they are fortunate, for if is possible they may not be considered amusing at all And this is the state of things that could not have been contemplated Five) years ago. The colonists who seem to have that practical vein ration for Shakespeare which is proper to vigorous youth and which is so palpably distinct from the Studious literary veneration so prevalent in the old country, seem hitherto to have bestowed the most liberal patronage on the histrionic interpreters of the great pest But as yet they had rather nurtured unknown told me celebrity) than paid a tribute to acknowledged work In fact, they have no' for an actor to whom the voice of the London public would assign. the highest rank in his profession in li the theatrical history of Australia is ever written, the epoch-making event will be the arrival of Mr and Mrs Kean "
