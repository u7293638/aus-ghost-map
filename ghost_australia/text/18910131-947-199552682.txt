'My. poor. Felix, it is past now. Where, was I ?. .Oh,. I~ remember j'. I, waa, speaking of my opinion that 'you 'were- iri trouble some where and' could hot~se'nd for me. But my father overruled my objections, and began to-arrange,ypur affairs' with a view to admiriistering'your estate'. ' Then we found that you had made preparations for flight, and had; realised everything. My father said1 that -you - had abandoned me and our boy ; he thought bo, and the blow killed, him. But why- should you run away: frt'm poor Claire 1 I could:1 not believe it. You were somewhere, and we must go through the world seeking you, little Philippe and I, till we found you. Ten thousahdyrancs ? was all that was left of my dot.' ^ *- y ? 'How was that?' cried Dr. Jaquet, ; who though couacious that he had actod ; a base,, .cowardly, part in abandoning his wife and 'child, 'nevertheless' relieved that their wants were amply provided for un der his wife'smarriage settlement.; -7r ' Alas,the Sdtf was i nearly gone,'Madame Jaquet replied ; ' my father had specu lated with the. money tha't he had set aside for me, hoping to make it more. It was'little that was left, but^it kept us ? above want — my* little Philippe and I. I came to London and began my search. I obtemed professional, help,; but.=af tor epondfiig : half i 'niy ato're I' waa compelled to work alone. It was too expensive, but it was bard. I found I could do nothing 'without money ; what was I to do ? I look lodgings in Oamdou road, to bo near Philippo, who was at school, and near, my employment' ' - ' Your employment, Olaire !' cried Dr. Jaquet in iv distressed tone, as the vision of this delicately roared woman fighting her battle alono and uncheored, forced itself upon his mind too vividly to' bo pleaaant. 'You do not moan that you have been compelled to work Y ' Why nut— what else was there to do — was 1 to see my money melt away whilst I was doing nothing?! Boon learned a little English ; then I was engaged to teach French at a ladies' school. It was for Philippe's sake. He has cost mo little, though ; l.ia education, that is all. Hia mathematical abilities secured for him an excellent situation at the 'Universal.' He is enraptured with his prospects, though this is not what I would havo chosen for our son.' ' I had to give up my search for you when I became a governess. Only in tho holidays was I able to continue my efforts to find you. But nothing came of it. How could it 1 I had no cluo, and no one to advise me. When Philippe grew up he might have helped to find you quicker, but I could not lean upon him. I was afraid that he might think his father had forsaken- his .mother, and then— — - You understand— he would not love his father when I found you, and I wanted him to lloveyou.' ,-???.« -}.- - -..+,-.?-;??:./,.?.?' -..-?;, v ?

I felt faint with fear- and joy-r-fear. lest Philippe should notice iny agitation, and joy that the end jof my long search had come at last ; but jwith ;a; strong : effort I managed to con trol myself.

He would have been less than mman if he had been able to listen to the account of her pathetic struggles, and her long fruitless aearoh, without being moved.'; He was touched, moreover, that as yet she had uttered no word of condemnation or reproach. J5F ay, had she not eibibited-a beautiful faith in him, ascribing Mb night to political reasons,, and holding fast by her simple creed that her husband was the soul of honour, and that something— she knew, riot, what— had prevented him communicating with her ?'

The second icoii'rse -was to ''--ielb the ;woman who had, sought him 'through all the long years of their separation the bitter truth —that he was faithless, and had aban doned her and, their child with deliberate intention. He took ueither course, pre- ' ferring to adopt a temporising policy; I He would not trouble his dear Claire* he said, with his story just now, which would take long to tell. It was enough that she had guessed- rightly p he had been warned ' in time to fly , from Paris. He did not know that Bhe was in England, If she had notleft Parisin searebjof him it would havo ..been different. Theirvlong separation won Id have been spired to them if s.lio had remained. Madame Jaquet was easily satisfied in the great joy of recovering 'her husband, and gently blamed her own precipitancy in leaving Paris for 'England as the only cause that had kept them apart for bo long. Then Dr. Jaquet proceeded to open out his plans fur the future. He dilated with convincing roaaoning on the difficul ties that would surround them, if he suddenly presented his wifu to the circle in which he moved. What explanation, he asked, could he give or the long years of separation? Hotv Wuuldic be possible to disarm tho venomous criticisms of malici ous tongues? Her position would prove intolerable, if she were called upon to run the gauntlet of curious enquiries who would seek to prove their Becret to the bottom and who would not spare. No ! this was not to be thought of for a moment. . ? He was not thinking so much, he eaid, about his professional reputation, whioh would' suffer if any scandal, however innocent its character, became connected with his naruo— for he could afford to lay down his' practice and retire on his repu taMon, which was deservedly high — but he was thi'iking of hia dear Claire. and what iras best for her happiness. He was in favour of returning to Paris, where their re-appearance would occasion less remark, and where suspicions, if any arose, could much moro easily be allayed. He would aeo to his dear Claire's comfort whilst he was making arrangements for the disposal ef his house in Harley street, and when his affairs were wound up they would leave England for ever. 1 Madame Jaquet, who was willing to go anywhere with her husband, and who felt that in the delicate state of her health,' excitement would prove injurious to her, was. nothing loth to be convinced 'by 'this reasoning, which had succeeded in 'securing for Felix Jaquet that invaluable commodity, Time, that so often fails men at their need. . Ho wanted to think out a ?way in which the. ghost irhich had sud denly, sprung up in this path could be' 'effectively -laid. He was in -the : position , of a man with two wives ; one, known to society as such, the other his true: wife in ? the eye of the church and the law but of iwliom society knew, nothing. : , ; At present he could see no way but of, tto. dilemma ;? he must have opportunity, for reflection and this he had' now secured.' ..'/; f '.

There ':'? was always something for 'him to telli andifoir her to .hear ; some new. difficulty, that' had arisen that wouldiineceBsitate delay, or some old difficulty that had been made to diaiipipear 'like' magicJ ' 'They talked confiden tly - and hopefully 'of |rth'§ 'futures- planning where they'-'wouia' ! livev'when: they returned to Paris, and how they would pass their days ; for by this time Dr. Jaquet;' had announced hia resolution to retire from professionaliifo,and devote the remainder of his days to the Bociety of his dear Claire, of which he had been so long deprived. One evening- he remained later than usual, and as the girl appeared in the hill to open the door for his departure, ho expressed hia surprise that MrPhilippe Jaquet had not returned. 'Kindly ex plain to him when he arrives thatlwaited for him as long as I could. Madame is decidedly better to-day, and if the pre sent improvement continues, she will be able to go out for a drive in a day or two. But tell him also that Madame doeB not get enough sleep. She lies awake at nights until she bears him retire, and that is bad for her and retards her recovery. Tell him from me that if he values his mother's life he must keep better hours. And, ob, by the-by, ' . he added, as he descended the stepB, after giving these instructions, ' as Madame is disposed to sleep now, you had better not disturb her. Can you re member ail that ?' he enquired. The girl promised, that the message should be duly delivered, and the great physician, hailing a passing hansom, was soon lost to sight. Philippe, in deference to thephyai dan's message, which lost nothing of its urgency in trantnission, delayed entering his mother's room, until the thought struck him that her Bleep was becoming more protracted, than was likely to be beneficial. . ' She will not 'sleep to-night at all,' he said, speaking , to himself, £}i she is not roused.' .; ',,,;,?' na ~* The sun was Betting as he entered his mother's room, and a' rosy light bathed her pure face in- the soft glory' ofrth'e dying day. . , .- . : ', .,::--?-,:?- .:;.,'?:';; « i' ?:-' \- What was it that, suddenly caused his; heart to atop its beating, and then to rush forward with a bound as though it would burst through its prison, in his breast?

' ' 'Perhaps I had better explain. Your mother came tp us in the summer of 1854 to propose an insurance on her own life. She explained to me, in confidence, her reasons. They were these. She was not a widow, as I might have supposed from her making her application in her own behalf. She was the wife of Dr Jaquet, an eminent French specialist, who had been mixed up in the troubles of the times, and they had got separated. Her own fortune was seriously reduced, and she had no clue to the whereabouts of her husband. But, as she had reasons for for thinking that he had ultimately effected his escape to England, and was probably then in London, she hoped to meet him before long. Meanwhile she was anxious about her little boy — your self, I presume — fearing what might be his fate in the event of her death before her search succeeded. I gave her some advice how to proceed in her main object, and the insurance was effected. I fancy you will find - a- will, and when you do, oome to me, and T will assist you to get the formalities completed as quickly as possible, so that your claim may be pre sented and met- without' delay.* ~''*~ Philippe, who was in amaze.at this revelation of his mother's retiosnee and forethought, thanked Mr Webber fpr^hia, kindness and retired. His mind was in a whirj at he returned to his desk.' -This' conversation,'; which took place a week', after his mother's funeral, and was the; ' first business ? transacted by Mr Webber ? 'after hia return from hiB summer holiday,.. was an important epoch . in Philippe jJaquet's life.
