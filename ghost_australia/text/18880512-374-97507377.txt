Bat Clemence stood bravely under their glances. Her face lit with a great purppge ;1 even those rough men seemed to feel the parity of it. Finding she had neither rope, pistol, nor poison about her, they voted it could be no harm for her to see her ami, as they decided their prisoner to be. So the concierge took seance, and mounted before her to the top tot the house. He took a key with him, and opened one of the rooms. " Can't afford light to prisoners of state," he said, as Clemenoe peered into the dark ness ; 11 but, for the sake of doing things pro per, I don't mind lending yoa the candle for year visit." • At first, Clemenoe was eo overcome with joy athfirsuecees, that she ccMd not speak.

" I oan remove a bar in a couple of hoars," Eugene exclaimed, " and in the darkness I can escape no gaslight to-night to betray' w- 1» " *■ me. - 'And I had better go sow," Clemenoe marmared. " Oh, you dear little girl 1" Eugene cried, taking her two. hands and pressing, them to his lips, not noting the vivid scarlet flush whioh spread over her face. " I am afraid you will bring yourself into trouble hy this. Keep close; let yourself be seen as little as possible, or they will visit my escape on your head; I shall never be happy tUl you are safe; I shall never forgive myself if evil befall " Do not think of me. Hark! I hear the concierge earning back. Ob, be careful ; do not look bo happy." And Eugene aBsamed his sullen, despairing attitude as the concierge opened the door, seized the candle, and gave a hasty look around. " Time enough for love-making," he mut tered. "Needn't trouble yourself to oome again, mademoiselle, because he's going to be shot to-morrow-^ has with all spies, I say. Viva la Commuiw—viva la Bepublique 1" And he showed Cletnence into the streets politely enough; How dark they looked now 1 like an anfathonable gulf of blackness. Clemence almost wished it were, Indeed, a gulf, into which she might plunge, and lose forever the burden of life. Thenshe thanked God that He had-given her the chance to save her friend—even to save him for that happy being whose fate it would be to walk life's ways-at his side. She longed to wait, that she might be sure of his escape, but feared that might in some way lead to suspicion. She leaned a moment over the dark waters of the Seine, thinking how peaceful the waves looked, and yet what dark tragedies they hid. Once beneath, how , soon the cold arms would embrace her; like a dream all her cares would vanish; death would lay his hand on the aching heart and j etill its pain forever. Bat something held her back from Singing | the life that God had given at His feet.. A thought of Christ and His patience came over I her. She walked fleetly .along, with a vague j idea of making her whole life ja crucifixion of ! self, only she was too worn and weary now— j the wound was too fresh. Alter a day or .two ! she would go forth to . her liie's work—to nurse the sick and comfort the suffering— j and the very, purpose sent a ray of comfort to her soul. She groped her way through the dark pas sages to her little den. She had eaten noth ing all day, and a deathly faintness came over | her. She had one candle left, and when she had lighted it, she saw that some missile had crashed through the little window, and shiv ered the panes of glass to atoms, and the pot of fleur-de-lis had fallen into the courtyard j below. . j Poor Clemence 1 She bad not wept before, | but the t3ars came now. Her last memento of that happiest time in her life had been ; snatched away. €iike herself, the fleur-de-lis had been dashed to the ground.' Clemence traced a whimsical resemblance in their fates, but wept over the flower as she had not done over ] herself. j The next day passed in a sort of tired j stupor, from which she. made no attempt to j rouee herself; bat toward night an nnusual j exoitemeht seemed to arise in the streeetB. Clemence began to fear her loneliness. It was j so hard to have no human being to speak' to —no one to say an encouraging word to her. j Oh, how the child hungered and thirsted lor love 1 She waB like a dinging vine suddenly' torn away from its support. " I cannot bear this longer," she said, as j the shouts and frantic cries, and noise of j marching troops and cannon shook the houBe. i " Even old Mother Brie wSl be betterthan no one. She can, at least, tell me what it ia -all about. Oh, I pray Eagene js safe 1" So Clemenoe wrapped herself in her shawl,1 and stole out in the dark streets towardthe house of the aid washerwoman. ' She found Mother Brie dressed for the pro menade in a clean whire cap and apron, and j quite excited with a rather pleasurable excite-1 dent at the promise of a night t>f terror. " Oh, I came to stay with you," Clemence cried, in dismay. — " So you shall, dear," oheerily replied the woman. " I only want to have a look at j the famous barricade to the Madeleine. Mon i Dieu 1 how a Frenchman does esjoy a barri cade! I swear, they inight have beaten the ■ Prussians if they could only have torn up j 'some city pavements andtaadea genuine bar ricade.

" B-.it what are you'gang to do with the kerosene?" Glemence criod, in surprise, see ing oid Mother Brie putting a can under her shawl. " Light the joy-fires, you know," Mother Brie replied, laughing again. "Come, yon shall see." And Clemence, fearing to be left alone, -clung to her strange companion, and they feentoot together.
