VICTORIA HAT J,. The bioscope entertainments being given each night this week by Mr. E. H. Stevenson at the Victoria Hall have been the subjects of favourable c-riiucism, and the general opinion is that no "better performances of the kind have been seen in the city. For two hours there is not the slightest flagging of interest. No fewer than 35 different films of moving pictures are shown, whilst over 100 views of various places of interest are described by Mr. Stevenson, wlio acts in the dual role of lanternist, and lecturer. Whilst all the bioscope pictures are especially good, and the flickering effect is absent, there are two which call lor special comment. That o£ the astronomer's dream, which is 3U0 ft. long, is a remarkable film, and being beautifully coloured it produces a tine eliect. liider Haggard's "She," the pillar of fire, is also exquisitely tinted, and is enthusiastically .received each evening. Tlie longest film shown this week was 350 £t. in length and represented the employes of Messrs. Caiman & Sons, Norwich, to the number of 3,000, Itaving work; but Mr. Stevenson will to-night show "Cinderella," a film no less than 400 ft. long. "'Photographing a Ghost" is an interesting and amusing picture, and other lilms include several train effects, "The Miller and the Sweep," war scenes, and various beautiful sea views. Mr. Virgo has made arrangements with Mr. Stevenson to remain till the close of the week, and three more entertainments will be given, A change of programme is announced for this evening.
