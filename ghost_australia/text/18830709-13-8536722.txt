TYPHOID FEVER. TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGES. SIR-In my communications relative to typhoid fever and its causes I have not said anything but what is fully known to and believed by the medical profession I had no new truths to offer, I have only desired to make the public acquainted with the many dangers v. Inch are created by man himself We know whence come epidemics, why on demie fevers cling to the fatal spots, why sporadic cases crop up often in nature's para cases, but which man has made vile I am anxious that this should be kept carefully in view, because it is only by the co-operation of human agency, guided by common sense there is no mystery about it that fever will be driven from the land And man can do it in the 19th century it is terrible to look- back to 1934, when the Plague broke out in London, and to know it was a preventible disease, and to have it on record that upwards of 100,000 people perished thereby. That at intervals of about 12 years this disease malignant typhus had regularly visited London, each time carrying off about quarter the population If your readers would peruse Defoe's Plague in London, Action though it be, it will simply give them a faithful narrative of that time of horrors Two years after. 1956, the Great Fire in London took place ; the (Plague never reappeared thereafter-its old haunts were gone Some 45 or 50 years since one of the old pits in wlnclnhundrnds of the dead had been buried, was accidentally opened up Two or three cases of the old malignant disease appeared, but no more, the deadly poison found no Locals islands The Plague can never break out again in London. In 1828 it was rumoured in England that a dreadful disease of unknown character and frightful fatality was raging in India, and indicating evidence of extending beyond the regions where it first broke out. There were no telegraph wires, nor overland route, nor rapid steamers We heard at uncertain dates of the spread of the malady, Asiatic cholera, and in 18-1, at the close of the year, it reached London None who saw that irruption will ever forgot the dreadful rapidity of the disease, or the sufferings of the victims, or the impotence of the medical profession were powerless It ran its course, following by a kind of choice water- ways for its travels, it journeyed almost with post like regularity It would take all the houses on the one side of a street, or one house on either side, it would insist on a lonely Millage and strike down a victim in almost every house Wherever garbage was! allowed to rot, there the disease made it prompt visitation 'the laws of nature are immutable, inexorable, impartial, and of perpetual force In 1841 Mr Parker reports thus -"As to the state of drainage-Windsor, which from the con- tiguity of the Palace, the wealth of the inhabitants and the situation, might have been expected to be superior to any other provincial town such is not the case, for all the towns visited by me, Windsor is the worst by all comparison " In 1894 Prince Albert died of typhoid fever communicated by a foul! sewer It is perhaps advisable to mention that a cholera is out a form of typhoid fever, springing from the same causes, operate Lithgow the same classes of A teams, and a discriminating respecting the local conditions where it chooses to infringe and kill Medical men know all this The profession has stood alone in the breach warning every man and teaching every man of the arrow of death which lies on the vapour of putrescence But why the miasma arising from the overflow of the Nile should produce plague, that of the Ganges cholera, of the West Indies, The, yellow fever, the marshes of temperate regions simple intermittents, we know not We know the facts, and that all Feversham but typhoid, modified The explanation probably is that each distinct impurity genders its special living atom-all cousins to each other, all subject to the same general laws, and all preventible. by men To illustrate the question of prevention the Black Assize already referred to occurred in Oxford This town always had its share of malignant fevers In 1517 the rivers were cleansed and the drainage was made effectual From that date it has been " in a particular manner so free from pestilential diseases that the plague of 1005 never visited it, although the terms were kept, and the Court and both Houses of Parliament did there reside " I well remember the first case of Asiatic cholera we had I was an apprentice, just finishing his time, at Richmond, near London The whole country was painfully on the look-out The disease had been Rendering in the delta of the Ganges since 1837. It spread in distinct lines with wonderful uniformity, averaging one degree a month It swept over Burmah, and did not cease its deadly march and in 1883 it compassed North America and reached Mexico At last we had accuse , it was in water lane, an ostler, and half-past 7 a m. The man was heartily well and washed himself at the pump that morning, joking about the cholera morbus At half-past 11 he was dead I think that was an average case. The dark blue skin cadaverous face, withered limbs, unionism,,'. cramps and spasms, death by coldness, pulse, less All the serum running from the body, and all this with the thousand of other instances caused by a malaria rising from marshes in India and wafted on the wind, guided by unerring instinct all round the world, gaining renewed vitality from malignant side, which girdle the earth with us sure a line as that of the Atlantic cable ; leaping over cordons drawn round the palace, and distilling its virus among the dwellers in the Boroughs, uttering every where the awful warning " be clean in all things, Or die I " I remember the terrible picture drawn to represent the burial of Napoleon the Great in Paris, marshalled thither by the ghosts of the countless legions of the armies he had led in battle Itneedsno imagination to believe, had one but the faculty of seeing that he could behold in the ambient air to wrack of countless legions of envenomed atoms rising from rottenness and decay, and flying off to drop in distant lands their missioned heralds of the fatal pestilence July 7.
