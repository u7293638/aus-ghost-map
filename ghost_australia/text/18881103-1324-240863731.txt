M A L M S B U R Y . (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. ) Friday. Everything ir. the gossip and news line is still fiat, -£talc, and unprofitable, and even at the police court this afternoon there was not the ghost of a flutter.

On Thursday she died and to-day her remains were buried at Fryerstown where relations were already interred. Mr and Mrs Strachan were long identified with the colony, and were well known on the Loddon. There has been a little stir in the matrimonial line here. Mr John Halton and Miss Stokes had the knot tied in Hyneton. Mr W.
