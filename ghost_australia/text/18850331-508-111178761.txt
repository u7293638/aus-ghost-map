An Infuriated Bull. SHOT BY A VOLUOTEER INPANTEY MAN. A scene of great excitement occurred in the domain on Saturday morning about 8 o'clock. A mad bull escaped from those in charge, and rushed through the streets into the domain, where its actions caused much alarm to the peaceful citizens who happened to be there. The men from whom it escaped soon ap neared. and kent it from the crowd of some 300 people, who, attracted by the unusual sight, speedily collected. No one knew exactly what to do. One man obtained a small revolver, bat could not dispatch the beast therewith. At this juncture, and when things appeared to be getting rather serious — the enraged animal frothing at the month and preparing for a charge — Mr. Miles, one of the messengers in the Legislative Assembly, told the bull fighters to hold the animal at bay if possible, while he sent for one of our citizen soldiers, who quickly appeared in the person of Mr. W. Kail (a noted shot of the 1st regiment of Volunteer Infantry), who arrived with his Henry rifle, took a steady aim. and dropped the regulation allowance of lead into the skull of the animal, who thereupon gave up the ghost. The per formance was greeted by quite an ovation from the crowd.
