AT -SUNSET TIME. Bnowoounn with roses faded There glides a form along, When day is sauset shaded And sweat from evooing song. Its main, more sad than sorrow Enshrnuded by despair Of life that hopes no morrow, Apart from haunting care, Its eyes as lightning flashes, When hroaks an Austral drought, Or gleamiongs from the ashes, Of passion's fire guon out. So comes the form at sunset With strange dark lovely face, Inspiring all thebo wild regrlte That yearn for youth's lost grace. Oh I youth of dead delnsions, Old days and years far fled, More sweet ore these illusiune Than truth's experience read. What boath the years still hidden, The past bath promised not ? Perchance some joy forbidden ; Youth's dreams hbth no'er a blot. The boyhood'dreams so tender, Why have they proved but dtoms ? Soft dreams of mucking se .-??r Now seen through lour; gleam~ , Why must the once bright visions Die done to starless night ? Mid cynic thought's derisions, Is naught for ever bright. Why falls youth's fairy palace When youth on0o f.ces life And drinks its wormwood ohalica Filled by the hand of ottifl ? ie'time on earth naught, only Than realeses spirit pain Of nameless longinse lowly, For rest invoked in vain? The pries man pays for knowledge Is innooence and peaoe, The oin, tho world's stern college, Demands without surcease. Life clad with fiery trouble, What is it at the best ? A time blown passion bubble Some day there will be rest, With sach suggestings bitter So glides the form fall sad As love, lost mid tho glitter Of bridal glory glad. Its hot hoand grasp the dreary Dead sprays of wattle-bloom, Like garlands drooping weary, O'er some forgotteo tomb. So glides it, softly stealing, As breaks the white star gleams, This form, to me ree ailng, The ghost of youth's dead dreame. Ab I osnnet's visions mourtIful, One truth at least doth stand, Above Time's failings ecoreful, All life is in God's Enud. CLARENCE O.
