CONSECEATION OF THE RIGHT REV. DR. DUNNE, CATHOLIC BISHOP OF BRISBANE The ancient and stately ceremonial of the Roman Catholic Church, with its splendour of effect its mystic symbolism, its impressive solemnity, has ever forcibly appealed to the heart of man and entranced his imagination. Even if with the old Benedictine writer, Dom Claude de Vert, we look only to its literal and obvious meaning, we cannot fail to be struck with its grace and beauty, but if we penetrate the veiled and spiritual sense our natures must be dull and insensible indeed if they do not respond to the charm with which it is instinct. In the great temples of Catholic Europe, whose immense preportions permit the dignified flow of long processions, and the graceful grouping and easy movement of a huge concourse of ecclesiastics-in the majestic basilicas of Rome, teeming with the noblest efforts of artistic skill-in the historic churches of Paris, whose lofty pillars and pointed arches and endless perspectives raise the soul unconsciously into the higher regions of devotional thought-in those great monuments of ancient faith and piety, where everything, from the tesselated pavement to the fretted roof, speaks a hallowed language and harmonises with the worship for which they were erected, the soul is touched as it is nowhere else by the more than regal pomp with which the offices of religion are performed and the effective use made of every influence by which our feelings can be moved and elevated. The homage so solemnly offered to God in per- fume and incense, amid the sparkling of gems, the play of painted light, the accompaniment of inspiring music and the unequalled archi- tectural surroundings has won admiration from the sturdiest opponents of Rome - those for whom she is the Traviata of Babylon. Before so noble an expression of mans adoration the voice of the scoffer has not unfrequently been hushed into reverence and the large sympa- thetic hearts of such "heretics" as Scott and Coleridge, Guizot and Goethe have been conscious of the most elevated emotions. In this new country of ours we have neither the sublime structures, the precious adornment of art, the number of exalted dignataríes, the variety of ecclesiastical and religious costumes, nor many of the other accessories which lend such beauty and dignity to the Roman ritual in the great centres of Catholicity. Still even here in Brisbane the "functions at St Stephen's have a fascination whose influence is not con- fined to the Catholic community, but which attracts, almost every Sunday, large numbers from the other denominations. It is not astonishing, therefore, that yesterday, when one of the most imposing ceremonies of the Catholic Church was to be witnessed \- when the Right Rev. Dr Dunne, the lately appointed Bishop of this diocese, was consecrated to his high and important office-a sight such as few amongst us have beheld or are likely again to behold - the concourse as- sembled in spite of the unfavourable weather was one of the largest and most widely repre- sentative ever seen within its walls. No doubt the motives which brought together the different elements of the crowd were varied, but it may be safely assumed that besides those of curîosity and piety, one of the most general was a heartfelt desire to show the esteem in which the new prelate is held by people of every creed and grade amongst us. To his own flock his highest recommendation is the com- mission of the Holy See with which he is charged, but they do not forget the qualities of mind and heart by which he has endeared himself to them during his long residence in Southern Queensland, while on persons of other denominations his culture, his Christian courtesy, his spirit of tolerance and concilia- tion have given him claims which they readily acknowledge Before the ceremony commenced the large assemblage had ample oppoitmuty to examine the preparations which had been made, and all must have been struck with the tasteful decora tion of the high altar, the credit of which is due to the Sisters of Mercy.
