THE WESLEYAN PIC-NIC AT NORTH- COTE. The Wesleyan denomination at Northcote availed themselves of the holiday to hold q grand pic nic in connection with the laying of tbe foundation-stone of their new cburpb. The unfavorable weather, however, prevented the pic-nic, during the earlier part of theday,being tbe success it otherwise would have been, but towards three o'clock, as the time for the ceremony to commence approached, the attendance considerably increased, and at the time the stone was laid there were between three and four hundred persons on the ground. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. William Taylor, of California, assisted by the Rev. James Wangh, the chairman qt the district. After a couple of verses of the 137th hymn had been sung, the Rev. Joseph Dare read the 84th Psalm, find the Rev. John Egglestope offered up prayer. The memorial to be deposited in the stone was then read by Mr N. Wimble, the secretary, and then it, with copies of the daily papers and a copy of the test issue of the Wesleyan Chronicle, was deposited in the recess and the stone lowered. A silver trowel, bearing a suitable inscription, was then presented to Mr Tiiylor by Mr Francis E. Brewer, who briefly narrated the history of the movements of the committee in connection with the endeavor to erect the church. The Rev. Mr Taylor then applied the trowel and plumb, and declared " That this stone is well and truly laid, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." He then delivered a short forcible and practical address, at the close of which the ceremony was brought to a termination by the Rev. E. King with prayer. A collection was made during the ceremony and heartily responded to. In the evening a tea and public meeting was held.
