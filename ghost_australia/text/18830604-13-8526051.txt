An organisation of which Mr George Coppin, M L A , is the head, has com- menced giving religious instruction in the central state school, Melbourne, after school hours In the southern suburbs a movement of this kind was initiated soma months back The friends of Mr Jamea Goodall Francis, M L A , will regret to hear that the hon gentleman has been confined to lus house at Sunbury, by illness, since the beginning of April last, and is stall indis- posed _ SOCIAL AND GENERAL The late anniversary of the Queen'sÇBirth. day was observed in Melbourne in a more thorough and hearty manner than usual. At the Governor's levee there was a larger attend- ance than has been seen of late j ears. Not- withstanding the disorganised condition of the volunteer forces, there was a fairly buc eessful review in Albert-park. Altogether 1,774 ofhcers and men were present. 1'he arrangements for the representation of . the colony at the Calcutta Exhibition are1' progressing satisfactorily , The question of enlarging the Alfred I graving-dock has been discussed by the^ inspector general of public works and the-* secretary tor ports and harbours, the consul- ,¡ tatton having arisen out of tbe difliculty ex-'" perienced by the Orient Company in con-.' pexton with the renovation of the Austral. ; The dock at Williamstown is just large enough to receive a vessel of tbe Austral'a dimension«, but there would be very little room to spare As it is not improbable that other vessels of her sire and larger will be placed in the Australian trade, the necessity for a sufficiently commodious dock is regarded as lmpeiative, and schemes for lengthening the dock have been talked over Any attempt to provide extra length seawards is held to be impracticable, but tho extension at tho shore end may be etfected with but little difficulty. The excavation would be almost entirely in solid bluestone rock, which would form the sides and render any extensive mason's work quite unnecessary The inspector general bas not gone fully into the proposal, but be has obtained snllieient information to induce bim to strougl) support this method of in- creasing the accommodation A tew years ago the department of Agri- culture undertook the eradication of all vines in the Geelong district on account of the existence of phjlloxera there ft has been alleged that such work was not properly carried out, and inquiries are to be made into the matter With a view of (tissnmiiiating information repárame, th< phylloxera disease, a set of plates published lu Frunce showing the insect m its various stages and the u) pearance of a vine when diseased, have been obtained, and they will be distributed among the viguerotiB The illustrations are of the creates! value, showing, as they do, on a very larg» scale the form of the insect, its epg<, and the condition of the roots and vines >rhen diseased, und any person with but a limited knowledge of vine culture should be able to detect at once any attack of the dreaded post hy comparing any abnormal con ditton ot ins vines with the plates Mr j E Redmond M P , travelling col« lector for the Irish National Leugne, arrived in Melbourne on the 20th ult, and waa re- ceived with an address of welcome by the local committee of the Irish National Land League He took the opportunity of stating tbut he had already experienced in Australia a very much 1 ireer amount of success than he anticipated In three months be had been able to obtain for the league he represented over £6 000 He also claimed that he had achieved u moral success, «tuting that he hud been able to convince very many men who at brat disapproved of his mission of the justice of the claims of the league He will deliver bia opening; lecture at St Patricks Hall, on the 5th Hist, the subject being ' Homo Rule Its Real Meaning Mr 1 rancia Longmore, ex M L A , is announced to take the eli ur Orr the following thursday evening Mr Redmond »ill speak lu tbe same hall on ' lhe Irish Land Question , and the subj ct announced tor Wednesday, June 13, li stated m the following terms - ' Wus the Irish Land League responsible for the Outrages Com- mitted ' Iht» Premier was waited upon a doy or two ago hy a deputation from the City Council, which advocated tbe establishment of a Metropolitan board of WorkB, and tile initia- tion of a comprehensive hj stein of drainage for the whole metropolitan area It was sug- gested, ns a means of expediting the work to lie undertaken by the bourd, that a commis- sion should he appointed to rake evidence as to which scheme wus the hest for Melbourne. Mr service depreeuted the appointment of a commission without the understanding that it was not to go over uronttd already traversed by coiumisatouH in Lnejaud and elsqjrhere.

It is now intended to take evidence upon a proposal to appoint courts of arbitration for the settlement of trade disputes 1 he Chief Secretary hus been considering the report of the late Police Commission with tbe comments tbereon of the chief commis Biouer of police He has accepted the salary seale drawn up by tbe commission and ap- proved of by the permanent head of the police force Tinder this new arrangement constables on joining the force will receive Ga per day, to be raised to Gs Gd m two years, then to 7s after another two years, and. ultimately at the end of 10 years' service to Sa per day, married men living outside bar-' lacks to receive Gd a day extra in ben of quarters The detectives as a separate branch will be abolished, anti the officers appointed plain.-lothes sergeants for de- tective duty-a rank that will possibly be a grade higher than that ol an ordinary ser- geant-but there will be no secret servios police, us suggested by the commission, thal idea not commending itself lo Mr Berrys notion of tho colony's requirements lu conuetlon with tho dotoctivos a now principio of government will bo introduced It ima been felt to ho vsiy necessary that snme means should bo provided for înatmug that only competent mon ehall be employed in that cup icitj- that It ia not enotii.h that a man Bhould be steady, attontive to depart mental routino, and of high character If theso qualities ho shown now, no matter how unfitted the it dividual m<iv be as n detective, it ib luipmsiblo to get rid of him, but when tho now scheme is intro- duced it will rest with thochiuf commissioner to decide whether or not a pi «in clothes sergeant shall romani at doteotivo duty or bo entrusted inertly with atreot service. The action of the trustees of the Public Library in thron/nig opon the Picture Gallery and Mneuum connected with that institution on Sunday afternoons continue« to be tho subject of much discussion and ugitatjon At brat, the trustees' decision morely applied io May, but thoy have since mado it upplic able to tho whole year, and hnva furlbor resolved to request tho Government to amend the regulation relating to tho Library, in order that that hkowiBO may be used by the public on Sunday A petition te Parliament in favour of the trustées' action has been already signed by 8"> 000 persons, mid tho petition prepared by tho socioty, which ob- jects to the course pursued hy the trustees, has also been very numerously signed With regard to the National Gallery, there has been a lengthy discussion in the press about M. Lefeuvre's picture " Chloe," which was one of tho exhibits in the French court in the late International Inhibition in Mel- bourne. This splendid painting of a nude female form was bought by a well known surgeon in Melbourne, and lent to the Gallery. The question of the propriety of ex- ibiting it, however, having been raised, the owner solved the difficulty by withdrawing the picture from the gallery It has already boon mentioned that Mr. Coppin, M.L.A., following the example set by another layman in another suburb, had taken steps to provide scriptural instruction for the state school children in East Mel- bourne after the hours set apart for secular education. Ills plan is to divide the children attending a school into three classes, viz., Protestauts, Roman Catholics, and Jews, and to secure the services of a competent teacher for each, the classes to meet on different days. The scheme was formally inaugurated ut tho Model School on the 28th ult There is un average attend- ance of 750 children at this Behool, and the parents of 311 have intimated their willing ness to avail themselves of Sir. Coppln'a oller None of these children oro under six yeurs of age, and it ia probable that many more would attend tbo classes wore it not for the fact that tbey go to Sunday-Bchools. Of the 311 children roferrod to 242 are Protestants, 20 Roman Catholics, and 40 Jewish. Tho Bishop of Melbourne has authorised a Church of England clergyman to take charge of the Protestant class, and the bead-teacher of the East melbourne llebrew school will attend to the Jewmh children. With regard to the Roman Cntholic children, a difficulty has arisen. Mr. Coppin put him- self into communication with nn oQioial representative of that church, requesting the appointment of a teacher, but received a reply to the effect that the church condemned the eystemof education adopted by the colony , that instead of encouraging the children of the church to disobey her laws, Mr. Coppin ought to exert himself to promote their trans fer to Roman C itholic Bchoola, ami that no priest could take part in his plan Codbc quently Mr Coppin has had to advertiao for a qualified religious teacher for the Roman Catholic childron 'J ho question of imparting religious instruction m state echoola after the regular hours was brought under the con Bideration of the Premier recently by a depu tatton from an association formed in Colling wood and itl/roy for carryinj; oat auch work in tho schools of that district. They asked that the use of the schools might be granted for the purpose, that soma modification of the arrangement for dismissing the schools at the close of each day might be made, in order that the children whose parema did not object to thoir receiving religious instruction might he classed liefere they loft the building and that no action should ho taken against any teachers who choso to re main while the instruction waa being given merely for the purpose of maintaimnc, order The Rev J \\\ utsford, who wob the spokesman for the deputation, auid that the association would work vigorously, aud that there was already a stall of 1 > to 20 clergy mon and laymen who were prepared to teach religion voluntarily. Mr Service entered heartily into the proposal, and promised all the assistance at Ina command to a move ment which he considered would eolvo the religion in state echoola difficulty without any trouble The will of the late Sir John O Shanaasy, K C M G , has been proved in the Supreme Court He leaves all his freehold property in Victoria, as well ae the fnrmtnre, pictures, Ka , in bia house at Hawthorn, to his eon Matthew, with directions that he Bhould allow Lady O Shanassy to select any of the property for herself, as she pleases Lita station Moira, in Now South Wales ho also leaves to Matthew A station known aa Mount Howitt, in Queensland, be leaves one half to bis son Kevan and the other half to his daughters, Mrs 1 u^eruld Mrs Shannaban, and Miss Grace O Shanassy, tho executors are to carry on the station for Uvo jearB, and then sell it, and divide the proceeds as stated lo the convent at Abbotsford he gives £200 to the Lmeralt! hill orphanage £100 and directs that £100 be given to the JeBuit fathers at Hawthorn to be spent in niuBaea for the repose of bia soul The reat of his real and personal property be e,ivea to bia son He directs that an annnity of £600 a year be paid to his widow, and makes it chargeable on his real estafo in Victoria He appoints Mr M O Shanassy and the Bon N 1 iu¿erald his executors 1 he Victorian property was sworn as amounting to £31 023 of which £15 300 is freehold A question bas arisen as to who shall succeed the deceased as the recognised lay representative of Catholic interests Amongst those montioned for the position is Mr N Tit/iierald, M L C , but this gentle man has expressed reluctauco to accept the position Mrs Hampson, a lady evangelist from lung land has been holding a eeriea of meetings in the Town hall Tbey have been very largely attended, and have been moat euc ceasinl. The Rev R V Danne, minister of the Alma-street Congregational Church, St Kilda, went to the United States about nine months ago entered himself as a student at the Medical Chirurgical College, Philadelphia, and obtained a diploma as M.D., with the intention of combining the cure of bodies with the cure of souls here. It has been argued that it would be unfair to those who endeavour to obtain the same degree here by a prolonged and expensive course of study at the Melbourne University, if the Medical Board of Victoria were to recognise his diploma and permit him to practise and the board has declined to register Mr Dance. A Contagious Diseuses Hospital for the treatment of persons ufllicted with Bmallpox and similar infectious diseases has at last been erected near Melbourne, in the vicinity of Williamstown The want of such a eana tori um has been felt for many yeara Mr William Thomson, rilOS died at his residence, South Yarra, on the 22nd ult, from an abscess on the liver He was born in Paialey, Scotland in 1S23, and settled ia Melbourne about 30 years ago, where he obtained a large practice, He devoted much attention to literary pursuits, and pub lished Boveral works on subjects ap pertaining to his profession The treatises in which he maintained the germ theory, or parasitic oriyn of phtlusiB, attracted great attention, both here and in England In fact, ho had a European reputation as a pathologist and epidemiologist Another topic with which his name waa particularly identified waa the theory of the Baconian authorship of the Shakspearo plays On this subject he wrote several books, pamphlets, and lettera in which he laboured with a zeal that, apparently, tho hopeleaeiiesB of his task only stimulated to indue« the world to erase the name of William Shakspeare from its hat of immortals He was a very com bative writer and bad no patience with hia critics Hu lins left ti wife and five children, Mr. Barclay Thomson, one of his eodb, who has been educated in the old country in his father's profession, ia about to enter into practice here.

The principal meet during the past fortnight has been that held by the Adelaide Racing Club, which opened on May 10, and owing to the inclemency of the weather, necessitating a postponement, the three durs' meeting was not concluded until May 31 On tho first day there waa eomo excitement, caused by the club removing Mr. Joseph Thompson, one of the Melbourne bookmakers, on account of his refusing to pay a fee of 10 guineas, levied by the club for the privilege of betting ia tho paddock. On the 23rd May an interlocutory injunction was grantad hy Mr, Justice Boucaut, restraining Mesura. Wackier, Ferry, and others, to whom the lenso of the Adolaido racecourse was granted, from charging Mr. J Thompson 10 guineas for admission, An action in the Supremo Court has been com- menced by Mr. Thompson, who claims £5,000 damages, and a very strong bar hua been retained on behalf of the plaintill.
