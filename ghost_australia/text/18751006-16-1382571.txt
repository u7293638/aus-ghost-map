Short title This Act shall be styled and may be cited as The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1875. Teapots have of late almost taken the place of Shakespeare in public amusements in Brisbane, and teapot drama has prospered in the Shakesperian never did. Talent has found a new avenue to success. It has no longer been a question as to a performer's personal abilities ; the quality and quantity of the plated-ware he could exhibit has been decisive of his or her acceptability. Scenery has gone out of vogue at the same time. Act I., Scene I, curtain rises and discovers a teapot, and the applause is deafening. The play turns upon a pivot of miscellanies. We have seen in former days, on the stage, performances which left much for the imagination to supply; latterly the audience has only to draw upon the faticyg?oods. An impressive delivery, a power of humorous delineation, goes for little now-a-days. intelligent audiences flock to admire an artist's coffee pot, to criticise the scope of his or her pickles, and to read over the humors of a bar of soap. Comedy is represented by the allotment to a spruce gentleman of a 2cwt. bag of flour, and the audience is convulsed by the genial wit involved in the presentation to a blushing shoemaker of a tin of sardines. There is at least the charm of novelty in this intellectual form of entertainment, and we don't see why it should not be wedded to the legitimate drama. The Ghost in " Hamlet" might come on, for instance, cased in plated?electro-plated? armor; a dish cover for breastplate, a coalscuttle for helmet, a nodding plumes of feather dusters, and its features pallid with a sample of the Hour. He might carry penholders in his ears, and have specimen slippers on his feet. In speaking the lines he could exhibit the articles somewhat thus ss-From thy father's spirit." " Number 07, one bottle Martell's brandy ; yours, Miss? Hand the bottle to that young lady." " Thy knotted and combined locks to part." " No. 38, a patent combination lock. Pass the look to that gentleman at the back, please." " And each particular hair to stand on end, like quills upon the fretful porcupine" " Porcupine quill penholder, No. 27. Now, don't keep us waiting, please; who has ticket 27'!" " List, list, oh list! " " Pair of list slippers to that old lady, No. 40. " Score off No. 40 will you, Hamlet." " And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed." " Fig of tobaccos, No. 9. A fig for the young woman, there." " But, soft; methinks I scent the morning star." " No, 22, bottle of superior perfumed 'air toll. Come forward, please, and take it in your 'and." Combined tins with the higher drama, no one could complain.?" Specialities" in JVtc Queenslander.
