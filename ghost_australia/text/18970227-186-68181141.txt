Mr. Stanley, at first, was inclined to trepodiate his cooperation ; and Mr. Mompeaun felt it i~-.mhmt upon him to warn Clegg not to inflnenrf the religions faith ?of the auBerers with whom he came in contact. 'I'll -ot interfere with their hopes of a future life, Hector,'* said Clegg, 'nor aay aught against prayer; bat what think yon, yowselfjabout the efficacy of prayer? You've done enough in that way to save the whole parish, every man jack ; but the purple sign of death coma out upon their flesh all the ?siiiit : tthey die. mn^ are buried.1* *' 1 eannot argue with yon, Clegg ; 'tis ni»nln— ' said Mompession ? but the rii****'** . iredonbled hit exertions for the physical welfare of his people, and Clegg, by bis anaa^y and bis cheerful encouragement, — — trfi~» many a victim from the grave, and — 'f*r*M many another with hit possets, his hot apices, and his pleasant words.

His mother had replied with texts, and wise sayingi regarding ?God's righteous punishment and the mystery ? of his divine ways. And Benben marvelled . £t liia mother's happiness and her exemption \- from the infection of the Plague ; for she went . among the people with never an ache or fear .untiring, dosing the eyes of the dying with \--such cheerful promises of a heavenly p«^'» Iteyond the grave that robbed Death of half &is; terron, and lighted for many a beart a !lampof Hope that showed them the snnny stairway to the white streets of the New jjemsslem. With winter, the villagers hoped the pesti ttenc* would cease. It hmd been bo, hitherto in -the hittory of the Plague in other lands ; bnt Eyam was doomed.

As the spring began to mw into sutntner, the Plague became general throughout the village. It ra£ed~ There was death in every breath of air.

All business else was stopped Koboiy worked. The cows nratinea no. miHr**!, the sheep unshepberded ; the Winship music in the cottages, the dead were buried ere the stricken limbe were cold. Graves were dug anywhere. In a house, a little way beyond the tillage, one solitary woman bad, bexaelf, buried every member of her family with her own h*od* ; wfaOe a neighbour had made bis own grave, and, etrewing the bed of it with straw, had l*t' tiim down and died in It was the last 6Uy of May, and oat of a population of three hundred and fifty souls seventy-seven had perished. Ot these were whole famili*— t and scarce a eouI that bad not been visited by Clegg, though encn was the terrible nature of the Ai***** that in the last momenta it was too loathsome for even children to tolerate tlieir -parents, or for parents to embrace their dying innocents. June found the Tillage in the highest etate of panic, the living, as if by a general impulse, resolriog to By from the place. It was at this juncture that the heroism of Mompesson and Stanley fired the fainting hearts of their flocks. At a (pedal tervice of the Church, in which the two minsters called the whole village together, of every creed and opinion, the Sector remonstrated with the people against the idea of flight. Already many of ths»m w^re jnfaf'tfrd. if not in thffir r^rfwmff, in their clothes ; moreover, they owed a doty to their fellow-creature* beyond the borders of the village. To carry the disease ont into the world at large would be a crime. If they were to die, let them stAod by each other and die together ; not poison the breath of the healthful and the happy, who. would fall earring them us the authors of their misery. Should they consext to remain with him and his brother Stanley, his wife and Sir George Talbot and his daughter, «od the rest of tbeir bopefal and God-fearing DfjghbotzrB, he trottM ask the Duke of Devonshire and other resi dents beyond the village, to send them relief of food and raiment, of medicine* and every possible physical aid ; and he was assured of the result of his appeal. They would there upon draw a cordon around the village, and there should be sentinels at fixed and con venient points, so *iTr** no one should pmw out or in ; and there should be selected spots where all that was needful should be passed within the cordon, and sanitary methods formed for disbursing each money as might be needed for payment. They would thus save the other villages of the Hundred, and the great world beyond, from infection, and snatch from premature death thousands of their fellow-countrymen. And their reward should be great on earth, as in heaven. Their names should go down to posterity on an everlasting scroll of fame, and when their time should come, their souls, ascending to heaven, should be welcomed with angelic songs, and Christ, sitting on the right hand of the Father, efaould say unto fin*h man and womm, and every child, ' Well done, thou good and faithful servant ; enter thou into the kingdom of God.' And all the people raiiri 'Amen !' and many fell into each others' arms and wept.
