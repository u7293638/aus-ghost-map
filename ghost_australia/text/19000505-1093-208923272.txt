HOW NEW YORKERS AMUSE THEMSELVES. Telegraphing on March 27 tl>e New York correspondent of a London- paper says: Miss Anna Constable entertained last night the One Hundred Club, and many .people desired to obtain invitations to the affair, which was styled a ''ghost party," and in all its arrangements was decidedly unique. 'Each spirit was announced as it entered from a dark room into a larger enclosure under the full glare of a calcium light. Each, in turn, was led1 across the Styx. There was a fanfare from the orchestra at- every entrance. . A '"'witches' " dance 'was executed by the blisses .Ship pen, Miss G-eorgie Wilmercling, Miss Margaret Stimsou, Miss Georgie Kinsley, Mrs. Arthur Cuiunock, and Miss Eibhel ..Hitchcock. Some cos tumes worn by the "spirits" were arranged in most artistic fashion. . For instance. Miss Iluth Lawrence, who represented, the Ruling Spirit of Gold, wore a gown repre eniting the precious metal in its various ?forms. It was made of white crepe, to suggest the snows of Alaska, with a wide band of bullion, anu around the hem of the skirt was a mass of golden coins. The belt band was of bullion, and the front and back of the waist wore covered with gold coins. The coiffure was powdered with gold dust, while nuggets of gold were pinned in it. Mis.-; ljree.se. as the"Spirit of the Blizzard, was in white and crystal, and Miss Constable represented 'the Spirit of Wasted Hours. When it ctime to the matter of supper the ghosts and spirits evinced keen appetites. When fortune happens to smile momen tarily on some people they apparently get the idea that she intends to do uli the (.wooina.
