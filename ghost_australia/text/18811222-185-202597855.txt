A LONE WIDOW. Near Menindle, on the Darling, one of the gentler sex (writes [?]gles in the Australasian) is to be found who has had the misfortune to lose her better- half, for the time being, on three different occasions. Travellers say that the is by no means the most amiable of women,,and this may account for the. heavy rate of mortality among those unfortunates who venture to woo and win the widow, the roadside shanty, and the bit of other pro petty. It is remarkable that each husband shuffled off the mortal coil in a different way —the first in the orthodox fashion, after along illoese; the next succumbed from the effects of exposure iu the bush, where he bad wandered after a drinking bout; and the third sent his ghost that bourne from whence no traveller re turns by suspending himself by a rope to the branch of a. gum-tree in the neighborhood of the bush shanty. The deed was dona in the darkness of the night, and amidst the noise and confusion of a general carouse the landlord was not missed until the morning, when one of the more sober guests discovered him hanging where the beef or mutton needed, for the table of the tavern at other times was hang. The landlady was duly informed of the matter, and quietly had a sheet placed around the re mains of the departed (or suspended), and left them swaying to and fro until the arrival of the trooper who was sent for,, and had to come same distance. In the meantime, two wayfarers arrived at the place, and had their stock of tea, sugar and flour replenished by the hostess, who informed one of them, in answer to thie enquiry whether she had any meat, that she was just out of that article. Noticing the enshrouded carcase hanging, the visitor naturally mistook it for a sheep just slaughtered, and directed her ladyship's attention to it. "Ob, that,” said she; why, that's my Charlie I Didn't you hear that he had bung himself!”—as she had weighed out another half-stone of sugar.
