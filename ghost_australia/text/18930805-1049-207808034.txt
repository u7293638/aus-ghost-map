ANOTHER DEEMING. LONDON, July 27. — The body of a woman named Carter has been found beneath the floor of a house in Berkshire, where she had resided. Her husband had been twice pre- viously married, and in both cases the wives had mysteriously disappeared, and were stated to be dead. — Cable. Our own office pote (sic) will now go on with his "raving" — in other words, the Bard will croak. Ghost or ghoul of savage seeming, gory shade of Masher Deeming, Man of many murdered wives ! Can this cable man be jolting down our throats canards revolting. He from doubtful source derives? Will there be a great revival, by some still more favored rival, Of those wild sensations we In our boudoir rocker rocking, read with eagerness quite shocking With our neighbor's after tea? Shall " discoveries distressing" reach us when we're busy dressing For a visit or the play; Shall we reach with expedition for the very last edition, In the old, familiar way ? Ghost or ghoul of savage seeming, shade revived of Masher Deeming, Tell us truly will we grasp For the "full details," and, reading all of blood and bodies bleeding, Will we shiver, will we gasp? — THE OWL.
