THE RACING. It will be a long timo before the Melbourne Cup of 185)15 is forgotten, as Newhaven's vic tory will be noted as the most celebrated ever secured in the bit* two-milfl e\\-f-nt nf Australia. He not only eclipsed all previous performances by carrying 7 st. 13 lb. to the front as a three-year-old, but he literally romped home by half a dozen 'enp-ths ahead of his field, whom lie had all well beaten a mile from home ; in short, the race can ba described as a procession, with Newhaveu first and the rest nowhere. It was a marvellous feat, and stamped the winner as the greatest colt Australia has ever produced, not oven ex cepting: Carbine. Naturally tbe victory of the Newminster colt was wonderfully popular, the vast crowd which had assembled at Flcmington beginning cheering when the horse was a furlong from home, while the scene was remarkable sis the post was reached, intense enthusiasm beinjf manifested. Hats were, thrown into the air, ladies waved their handkerchiefs, and tho crowd tumbled over each other to get a glimpse of tho winner on his returning to scale. Newhaven's success was of course a severe blow to the Ring, as the colt has been consistently backed from the issue of the weights, and amonjr those who profited by his success are a number of well-known South Ausiroliaus. The proceedings opened with the Hurdle Race, for which a favourite was found in Manazona, while Carlsruhe was the next in demand. Manazona. who carried Brewer, shaped very badly, but Carlsruhe ran in front till the la.st hurdle, where ha stumbled badly and lost his place. Merrigal was in company with Mr. Hales's horse here, and though he also pecked the obstacle ho had too much pace for Tertius in the run home, and beat him by three-quarters of a length. MerrigaL who was recently .-jiiccetsful at Randwick, at the A.J.C. Meeting, has proved himself a topsawyer at the game. In spite of all his weight Lieutenant was voted the best of tho contestants in the Railway Handicap, though 5 to 1 on the field was on offer up to the rising of the barrier. The Sydnev horse made a bold bid for victory under his big weight, but he just failed to catch another New South Wales representative in Armenia, who wm a rank outsider, scarcely any member of the Ring writing his name. Paul Pry again ran prom inently, and made a dead heat for second place with Lieutenant, but Princess of Wales never had a chance. Armenia is an English-bred horse, having been imported by Mr. S. Hor dern. During the race- Cohort, when look ing dangerous at the distance, unseated his rider, who had to be carried in in the ambu lance van, but he was not seriously injured. Backers had not made an auspicious open ing, but Key looked such a good thing for the Kensington Stakes that they did not hesitate to lay odds on her. Fortune, however, once more favoured the fielders, as whou the barrier was raised the favourite turned the other way and took no part in tiie contest. With her out of the road the race proved a good thing for The Elder. v.-'no defeated his -stable com panion St. Winnoch easily. Both first and second youngsters were bred at Morphettvill--, and St. Winnoch carried the colours of Mr. T. Barr Smith, who was present to see him run. The Stewards held an enquiry into the per formance of Key, but nothing was done, as the Starter exonerated the rider, saying that it was not his fault, as she slipped round the other way. Key is the filly in connection with which Hayes has been reported to the V.R.C. Committee for not attempting to get away in axaee run at a suburban meeting recently. The scratchings for the Cup were not nume rous. Lord Grenville has been running bo badly since his arrival at Flemington that Mr. Porter thought it useless starting him, and for tho fame reason tho owner of Sabre tache withdrew his colt. The only other absentee was The Officer. Mr. Cook electing to rely upon The Merry Boy, who had thc services of Huxley. The saddling-paddock was crowded 5jy those anxious to see the candidates undergo their final toilet. New haven had the largest levee, and it was generally admitted that Hickenbothani had him very well. Iu the early part of the after noon 5 to 1 v.-as procurable about him. but the public came so strongly for him that at the finish nothing bc-tter than 4's was procurable. Mr. W. It. Wilson started his three horses, but Resolute was the only ono which attracted attention. Ho was loolrina .all the* \v*tfar fnr his T)nrhv 1,-allop, and the stable were confident that they would turn the tables upou .Newhaven, but in spite of this he was easer in the market, being quoted at 12. A candidate who came- with a rattle on the course was Devon, aud he was a decided second favourite, while Marusa held his overnight price. No horse stripped better to the eyo than Broken Hill, but ho had no credentials to win such a race, while Bloodshot and The Skipper shaped so indifferently on Saturday that thoy were comparatively neglected. 'Quite a number of Adelaide people backed Miraclum simply because they were told to' do so. None of the touts had seen him working, but it was stated on what should have been good authority that the horse had done some good gallops in private, and wa3 sure to be dangerous. It was understood in tha morn ing that Goughwas to have ridden him, but eventually Thom-is was put up., The Chev-Jier, whose reign as first favourite was short and merry, went out of favour, but Hopscotch and Disfigured both had numerous friends. Disfigured first came out into the _ straight, but merely went slowly, it being left to Charge to show the way down the straight. He was followed by the St. Albans trio, Resolute wearing a blue band and Nada a red one, and then in quick succes sion came Dreamland, Pivot, Preston, Devon, and Newhaven, while the last two were Duhallow and Miraclum. the South Australian representative not coming further than the Judge's box. Mr. Watson did not keep them long at the post, and the barrier was lifted to a beautiful start, which took place at the top of the straight. Dreamland was the first to be signalled out from Broken Hill, Preston, Devon, Disfigured, and Newhaven, and as they came to the course proper the Ballarat horse was clear of Preston, Devon, Daraieu, The Chevalier, and Newhaven, while Miraclum was already last. Canoona shot out at the dis tance, but at the half-distance a cry announced that Newhaven was in front, and as he went past the Grand Stand two lengths ahead of his field it was apparent that the same tactics were to be adopted as in the Derby, and that he would endeavour to win tho race from end to end. He carried his field along tho rivor side of _ the course at such a bat that before the mile-post a number of his opponents were thus early holding out signals of distress, while it was taking the others all their time to keep within a reasonable distance. At this stage he had an advantage of four lengths, but before the shed was reached ho had actually doubled that, to the complete astonishment of everybody on the course. His nearest atten dants here were Resolute, Trentham, and Dreamland, the last- named having ahvavs held good berths, and they were all hard at it endeavouring to get on terms with the leader. They, however, could riot materially decrease the pp, and Dreamland gave the chase up at the home turn. His place was taken by Blood shot, who, passing Resolute in the straight, set sail after the favourite; butitwas all to no pur pose, Gardincrcoming on ashedid in the Derby and winning on Newhaven amidst intense excitement by half adozon lengths. TheSkipper deprived Resolute of third honours, but nothing in the race had a ghost of & chance with New haven, who could easily have put up a record time had he been pressed. Reka was fifth, with Damien, who ran well, next ; but, as 1 anticipated, Broken Hill was never dangerous, never being- seen near tho van after the first furlong had been traversed. Miraclum, who should have been kept in his box, took his place in the rear very early in the hunt, and there he struggled on, finishing a bad lost. I saw Gardiner after the race, and he told mo that at the post he was about tenth from the rails. He got away fairly well, Bloodshot and Canoona being close to him. He was running about fourth or fifth until within half a furlong from the Judge's box, when Newhaven was pulling a bit hard, and as he had not the slightest doubt about the colt's1 ability to keep in front all the way ho let him go and sailed along. He added. ' That is all I can tell you, as I never saw anything more of them. I should not have taken the liberty of forcing the running was I not sure -that New haven wan equal to the task. . I really rode a waiting race in front.' Gardiner, who is_ twenty-four years of age, originally started his career in Walter Hickin bothanrs stable, after which lie was with 11. lleKenua and H. Yeend. Ho then went to Sydney, and, riding for John Allsopp, was on Cremorne when he won the Doncaster Handicap and All Aged Stakes and on Trenchant in the A.J.C. Derby and City Handicap. He only went back' to Hieken botham last August, and in the short interval has appropriated tho A.J.C. Svdnev Spring Stakes, Craven Plate, and V.R.C. Derby, and now the Melbourne Cup on Nowhaven. It is likely that Newhaven will be sent to England after the next March meeting. The excitement 'haying subsided . over the big race, backers turned their attention to the Nursery Handicap, and flushed by thoir suc cess over the favourite's victory in the Cup thsy brought Keera down to a- very short price. The brother to Destiny made a big light under his heavy impost, leading to the half-distance, then ho failed, though he only just missed gaining a situation. The winner was supplied in Hypnotist, who beat the out sider Hymettus by three-quarters of a length, whilo the unlucky Fleet Admiral was half a length off third. Moore appeared to take tilings very easily on Hymettus from the distance, it beincr the general impression that he could have won, and after tho race he was called _ before the Stewards, and charged with suspicious running. His explanation was, however, accepted as satisfactory. There was a great rash to get on to Man of Honour in the Yan Yean Stakes, and he. was backed down to 3 to 1. The run on Mr. Red f cam's representative enabled the followers of the St. Albans stable to secure a healthy prica about Merman.- The favourite was never in the hunt, and Merman rewarded Mr. Wilson with hi3 first win, which was well received, as he has been out of luck. Merman only just got home, however, after a great battle with the smart Cinder Ellen, catching her on the post in the last stride, and beating her by half ahead. HURDLE RACE.

Broken Hill, and Devon were showing conspicuously at the head of Dreamland, but at tho courso proper Damien and The' Chevalier took com mand, -with Dreamland and Preston heading Newhaven. Canoona rushed to the front at the distance from Dreamland, but at the half- distance Gardiner brought tho favourite through, and settling down at the head of his field he led them three lengths past the Stsmd from Canoona and Dreamland, who were together just clear of J'reston, Trentham, and Resolute, with Devon, Damien, and Charge following in the order named, tbe rear being brought up hy Miraclum. Running along tha river bidu of the course Newhaven was out; fuur lengtlis from Canoona and Dreamland after whom came Preston, Resolute' and Devon on term?, with Trentham and Tho Chevalier clear of the next division, Miraclum still acting as whipper-in a long way off.
