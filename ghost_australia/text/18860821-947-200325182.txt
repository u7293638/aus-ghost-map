.' 'E0H0ES OF MELBOURNE ' ;/'?'.?'? [By Thb Ghost.] ''? ::i:ii ' ? The' !resulf of Mr.1 Munro s inopportune attack upon the Treasury Benches; has been 'an unmistakable' victory' for the Govern ment.' j By forty-six votes to twenty-three, the/ Assembly, has ! resolved to accept the Ministerial proposals in regard to the in ,creased! ' duty on '?' woollen piece : goods,- in preferance to the amendment of '? the: hononrable member for Geeloner.' 'iTha result of the onslaught on the Government' 'was heverVin doubt j but1 Mr. Gillies him self can never have anticipated so'full'ah; endorsement, of his policy as the division-: ?list1' affords- or assuredly— timed-i even! as he is'— he would at1 a1 much; earlier' period- of the debate have shown' some' 'little firmness, arid' ;thus have prevented t-he waste of time;occupied in .discussing a question in regard to which; there was so 'preponderating a ireigh't of both evidence and votes.

The imposition of a'highenduty thari 20 per cent, ad valorem, would not only hav.e thrown some two or three'thbu sarid'. hands' I in I the1 ready-made clothing. trade out of work, but would -have most assuredly 'ruined the intercolonial trade, and further have imposed fresh , obstacles in the way of a uniforiri Australasian1 tariff without 'which, as a condition precedent,: all talk of federation is mere idle 'words,; words, words.' ? ' l ? j; - '?'? ; Mr. Deakin, the Chief Secretary, is evi dentlythe-eH/ixiii terriblt , of .the .Ministry,1 'and* a.' great' deal of the waste of 'time' in-: volyed in discussing1 Mr. '. Murirp's futilei amendment may' be credited to the/unwise utterances of /the 3/oungest member of 'the ,Gpyerriinerit.'../Mr,/ Deakin has ', riot' yet learned how to 'put his foot down,' or 'to' say 'no,' and when the deputation1 of Geelorig woollen mill operatives inter viewed him as a ' monster ' deputation,' instead of ffivirig a decided answer, he, re- turned an evasive reply. .He stated; that 'if the /duty 0f,20per cent, was not found sufficient the Government would at ' soine future. time consider the desirableness of increasing it.' . Had the hon. gentleman's colleagues endorses this statement/ 'aiid allowed the advocates for higher duties/to hope that I the' : ' future time ''.', would,, be 'Vdiiring next/ session,'; Mr! 'Munro offered to withdraw his opposition to the Government proposals ; but Mr. Dow explained that Mr. Deakin only desired to hold out hopes to be realised at the indefi nite-period known as ' the sweet by and bye' and the Greek Kalends, and this assurance was not sufficiently, definite to placate the ultro-Protectionists, and so the discussion : was prolonged into far beyond the '/wee sma' hours,' ' and ; the/ division bell rung at a quaater- past four in '''tte morning.
