THE LUTHER CELEBRATION. To the - Editor of. the: Protestant Standard. : Sir,— So wo tore -to have a Protestant demon stration in memory of Luther!- May every Orangoman-an'd evory true Protestant do all -that in him lies; to make it not only a pleaBnnt success . out a great -revival - or irrotestant reeling, that a return may be- made to the religion of Jesus, and to the praotices , of- the apostles, from. which priest craft in all its ; formsTs a gross departure. May the movement not sink to more hero-worship. Most earnestly do I hope that no trimmers may be put to. tho. front.- There is a danger., of the movement boing thus emasculated. Some years backbone who was regarded at the time as' a pul- pit star in Sydney, came to lecture in the small town in which I, then lived, on " Luther and his times." Of .courso something racy, strong, and ' good was oxpocted. Being ' at tlie time President of the School 'of Arts, with whioh a few RomanistB wore connected, I> did object to the lectures being delivered: -in that hall, when a- 'nice, large- new church waB at his disposal. ; Alas, for- my caution ; it was-, quite needless ! ;;;The lectures were but I a sorry; and timid apology to. Romanists on behalf of Protestants for daring to love .the memory of Luther, a man. made, mighty by the. power, of God . The lecturer,? commenced; by , very -kindly asking those , of the , " opposite faith to give "'him, /their! attention and their patience, ,- as lie hoped . so. (to deal with his subject, tliiit'thoy. could not possibly bo offended. . And true, to his 'promisej he excised from itliq sketch of the! groat 'Reformer's life, not oiily all his strong 'sp'eeclios— his experience on Pilate's stairs at Route, his disgust at' tho impiety of the clergy, his burning tbe;P6pe's Bull/but all the best incidents in the career of that'Elijah- of the fifteenth century.- > I do hopothat no preacher; or speaker - will attempt to imitate this : feat of in-' tellectual gastronomy. : Never/before didiL feel the foree;of' these words eo;muoh— " Because ye -are -lukewarm, I will spew, you out, of, my; mouth," for -stomachic sympathy yith, -intellectual disgust, . caused tho , writer, to feel like desiring, a vomit. .. If Luther is to the front, let. it bo in all tho rugged features of. his . massive . character.- -It would bo sad "'to exhume, ,as it' were, such ai man ; "to; .dis honour not/only his/memory, but' it wot dd" dis honour our God, ' wlio'by grace 'made' him/what1 ho was;'; Lot us sob liim;' burning the; Pope's Bull ; \- and' hear him tolling, the' Popes not' ' to !belch' forth blaspliemings.
