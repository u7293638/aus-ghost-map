HARVEST FESTIVAL AT ORANGE. THE BISHOP OF BATHURST ON THE GOVERNOR ELECT. ORANGE, Tuesday. The Bishop of Bathurst preached in Holy Trinity Church, Orange, last Sunday, on the occasion of the harvest festival, in the morning pointing out that it harvest festival should be one of those days on which the ills of life should be forgotten, or at any rate thrown into the background, and the goodness of God and all our manifold blessings and enjoyments made the prominent subjects of thought In the evening, preaching from the second Lesson, Revel trial 1, the Bishop said whilst the text might be taken to teach something of the great doctrine of the Trinity, it also might not inaptly be applied to the Church with its threefold orders, ever giving prominence in its thoughts and teaching to the Father- hood of God, the Divine Sonship of Christ, and the refreshing and invigorating influence of God the Holy Ghost Speaking on the subject of the Church, he said that it was a matter for deep thankfulness to every loyal Churchman that Earl Beauchamp was to be the new Governor of New South Wales. His father was well known for his clear and definite Churchmanship, and the son followed in his father's footsteps He had every reason to think that the new Governor would take D deep interest, not merely in the diocese in which he chiefly resided, but in the Church in the various dioceses throughout the colony The Bishop congratulated the Church people of Orange on the success of their harvest festival, which, he said, far transcended nov thing he had been present at in that church before The Rev. J Lintott Taylor intoned the service admirably throughout. The congregations were very large.
