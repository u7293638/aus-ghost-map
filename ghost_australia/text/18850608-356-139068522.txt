NEWCOASTLE 3BTCYOLE CLUB'S "ST* ILZ'l' "' - The inaugural meetingcof the above clitb took place on thel grotuds of the Newcastle Oricket Club on Saturda? aftersiolon, nd In was a great succeess iii every way. T.heI attendance was large,' but there wvere uot sO many giersons present::a 'at" the meeting held byhv Mr. Rolfe recently.. The grindstand and lawn were extensively patronihed, the fair sex being very pro dominant. Hardy'a Great Northern ;Band Wa presenb, and discours.d appropriate i cesof music at various intervals. 'Tho whole of the events 'wre remarkably` well cuntested, and amongst those, taking part were several prominont 'and celebrated cyclists of Sydney, inoluding sMi. C. W. 3lornett, who gave the public some very interesting exhibitions of riding in the scverdl contests in which he engaged:. The weather up till about 3 o'clock was pleasanit, but from 'that out it was most uncominortably cold, and the clerk of course came in for a large share of abuse. . on gratulations were again heaped upon the veteran Traccy for the excellent manner in which he had the track, the visitors also expressing themselves similarly. The race of the day, the Five-mile Bicycle Handicap, was something werth wil.nessing, and will be remembered with pleasure in the cycling annals of Newcastle. The other events were eqtially "interesting, the result being that the sports were an unqualified snu cess. Previous to proceeding to the ground, a procession of cyclists star!ed from the Ship Inn, headed by the Great Northern Bund, and presented a most imposing spec tacle. .The progr.Lmme consisted of no less than 18 events, aid when it is co;asdered that at the conclusion of the gathering the officials were only 15 minutes'behind time, it. mus, be consoling to them o' know that the public were perfectly satisfied. Durin the day-Mr. W. Howlin. assisted by Master Bertie Moore, gave some startling exhibi tion's of trick riding, the most rvonderful of ihilh was standing on his head on two machines locked. Ihe manner in which ho mounted and remounted his binycl* won for Mr. Bowlin loud applause, and with careful study he will be able to hold his own ayainst- any of our trick riders. Young MIore, for a first publ'c appearance, sicceeded remarkably well, and with Mr. Howlin as his tubicr more will no doubt be heard of hini; .Mr. Clarence H. Hannell was in his cus'or0ary post 'f judge, nnd had a somnewha:t ditlic lt time of it, hut being an "old general" in matters iappertaininng to spoit of. any kind. h made everything run .a smoothly as pos sible under the circum'tances. Mr. Hn nall wa nessi-ted by Mr. M'Rae in his c<pacity of judge, whilst Mr. Wa.ter Sidney as timlekeeper rendered most effective service in many ways. Mr. Cop' laud, the well-known metropolitan cyclist, officia'ed as c'ork of the course and lap take', and the- manner in which he per formed his duties gave every satisfaction, to the competitors in particular. The referees were Messis. Gorrick, Wood, Pear son, and Ga:es, and the secretary, Mr. W. N. Cuthbhrtson, who is to be complimented upo.r the success he achieved in carrying out the preparatory arrangements. .Alto cether, everything considered, the first gathering of the Newcastle Bicycle Club was a succr-se from bregi:ning to end, and the meetings of this club should in the cour e 'of time hold a very prominent posi tion-in i..'al sporting matters. . - The following is. a brief- resume of the. day's proceedings : TWO-MILE BICYCLE RACE.--Pize, a Cup, presented by James Martin and Co. ii Fairhall st Heat.'
