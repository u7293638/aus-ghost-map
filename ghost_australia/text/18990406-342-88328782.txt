PFCULIAR APPETITE. There are on record many strange incidents with regard to the swallowiug capacities of various, animals. It is well known that persons of unsound mental health sometimes have extra ordinary cravings for the assimilation of all sorts of ridiculous and unsuitable articles. One patient who recently gave up the ghost in a metropolitan lunatic asylum had a strange weakness for pills. Pills in any shape or form, pills of any size and quantity, composed of ' any mortal condiment, nasty or other wise, they all went down alike- It has been stated tkat the individual in ques tion would not refuse bullets, and that he doted on grape shot ; but I find myself disinclined to believe the latter statement. A young man old enough to know better was. admitted to the Melbourne Hospital suffering from the swallowing epidemic, and stated with much difficulty that he had, ia cough ing, swallowed a vulcanite plate with six false teeth attached.
