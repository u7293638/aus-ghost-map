ARA;:I PASHA goes oat to ezSe witfcat the ETirpatfcttE of any decent vit~ ilea of the events of the last few montLs. end many a m&n; will be ready to Bay that exile is too good for Each self-confessed traitor. Had high-banded NAPOLEOT berai the Sir GAKSTT Wolssley ot the scene, with French interests LnpaiUcd, as Brituli ones were, and French blood spilled, as British bleed was, the probability is iat "ASASZ'S exile would have been to the invisible shades, and with a short shrift a&d; sharp despatch. a KAFOLEOK would hare marshalled his braves before the pyramids, invoked the ghosts of forty Egyptian centuries to witness the disp'.ay, wonid have given ABABI the felicity which Do* C-KSAE BE BAZAS pr&fe;£3cd to long for so modi, and n-oold bare published a grandiloquent tralletm to the " army of Egypt," glorifying them and his grand act of justice. We, oa the contruy, moralise and let him go. Certainly it is open to us to criticise as -well as to moralise. AEABI'S nsiog was not that of a true patriot, glamor of Oriental- romance .conld but that of * wild acd unprincipled adventurer, and not all the throw any halo of glory over his reckless and rapid rash to ruin, ^ e betrayed bis master; his cowardice or his incapacity betrayed bis followers, and he has left Egypt tenfold worse than he found it. For he bas wa«ted its sources, caused the destruction ot one of its chief cities, destroyed any little prestige that the Egyptian army ewr bad, and has left his coontry to pay the piper. Britain, too, will sufier in a pecuniary sense, for it is hopeless to expect that the British taxpayer will ever be recouped the million or two eipended upon the campaignand the military and naval gloty won on our side if, after all, of bat a second or third rate kind.

In the course of a' lecture on " Victoria through Fngfoh Spectacles," delivered by tbe ber. W. H. Kvacs in Dayleiford last Monday evening, the Lecturer said:—"The s question of tbe introduction of the Eibie into the State schools was forcing itself prominently into view, and wBt have to be fought over again and speediiy. Ia reply to thoae who contended that the present larri- IriniTOi waa tncesble to the exclusion of the G Bible, he said that those who are to-day the meat pronounced larrikins bad not much to do with tbe secular influence of the Act. The present agitation seemed-very much like an endeavor to shift tbe responsibilities of the! parents and churches on to tbe shoulders of the State. It it waa, as some maintain, a longing after the fiesh-pots of Egypt; a desire to go back again to tile old system of dssominatiottabsm and State aid to religion, he was prepared to resist it* to the Isst. To a man joat from England it was, he said, quite refreshing to breathe the air of religious freedom here. State aid to religion is, ssid the lecturer, had in principle, and, if possible, worse in practice. A church that cannot stand wiibost such a prop should be allowed to fall. Tbe application of tbe voluntary principle here in relation to religions ordinances was a credit to tbe colony, and would compare very favorably with\hat of any other land. THeaelf-deeial practised by the great unpaid army of Christian workers also commanded a very favorable notice."
