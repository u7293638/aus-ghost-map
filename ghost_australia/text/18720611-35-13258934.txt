Till Six 61 GllAllON AM) AltXIIDALL- The Bishop of Grafton and Armidale (says the Brisbane, Courier, has determined to reside permanently at the latter place, where the cathedral church is to be built, and it is proposed to devote to other purposes fifty acres of land at Grafton, originally intended for an episcopal residence This arrangement is not received with much favour in the eastern part of the See, and the Rev. C H Currey, incumbent of the Lower Clarence, has written a rather strong letter to the local journal on the subject Head vises that the Government should be petitioned against the proposed alienation of the land, and steps be taken for severing Grafton from the Armidale bishop to, which can be done, inasmuch as the nomination of the present Bishop has not been ratified by ii Synod. He states that "The present position the Church of England in the Clarence and other districts clearly proves that some other mode of operation is necessary than that of which has been pursued for the last (3) three years which, if continued, must cramp Ub energy, increasingly weaken its influence confirm even element of dissension, and either arouse oppo Bilicu or produce detonations li is all important that the inherent right of self-government in the colonial Church should be distinctly) asserted and fail) in untamed.
