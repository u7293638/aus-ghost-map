The date of the pi o luciion of the piece is set by Furiiival at 1605-6, and "we may take it fir granted," says Kenny, "that it was written in, the time of James the First, who ascended the throne March, 1603, as it contains an evident allusion to that monarch in act iv. scene i, and also a comirlimentary reference to him in an other part.
