But nothing occurred and when I had courage to look up I saw my lady seated in her chair, white and still with resigned anddcteinimed expression on her face It would have been a great relief to me if she had cured but there was not a tear in her eye ' Do you believe me guilty, Denise she asked ' 'His saints for but, I said, that such a thought should ever cross your mind I know you to be an innocent suffering lady ' ' You will do as you have been bidden to do, Denise ' AA'lnlc my husband and I are alive you will not speak of what has passed within this room Never, my lady I said ' And here again was the subject spoken of between us she did not refer to it and I did not care to do so, although it seldom left my mind " Well, a new life now commenced for us-a new and dreadful life Mr Balcombe denied himself to visitors, mil until you came my lady, no friend of the family ever entered the gates Mr T3aleonibo lived most of his time in his "study, wilting and leading, and pacing to and fro as he used to do in times gone by He never made any inquiries about melody, nor she about him She lived in these rooms, and in my ri remembrance did not stir out of them during the d ii Mt ter Ailinn slept in the inner room there and was electorate alone as he pic hand His was not a happy childhood, for when he began Gospels and think the arrangement between his parents of course, had an effect upon him and he could obt me no satisfactory lcphcstohia questions When he was with my lid) it was Mamma why do youngster did speak to papa And when he was with his father it was 'Papa Come to mamma, she w m son to speak to ha ' A Inch v as all no sign nation on his p i t AVhnt ucWa they had of each other's health and domes came through him they could not put a padlock on the child's tongue 'Papa, mamma has a bad headache Papa, mamma was ill in the night M Urania p ip has been waiting and waiting all day long I peeped in tin 600 h the door, and he looked so tired 'Minima see what papa give me Papa I have run away with this picture mamma has painted Is it not beautiful And so it went on, but the child's e idea anxious love brought them no nearer to each other in the dark nights, when the weather allowed, my lady would walk in the giounds-ilvvays alone, and it got to be said at the moonlight shone on her white mess, She looks like a white ghost ' of She is like a white shadow moving in the moon's light' Her husband was careful to keep out of his sight when she indulged in a lonely walks, they never made the slightest advance to each other ' I must not forget to tell you what occurred a few months after this city angement The night was 's a by dark and I had seen my lady in bed, and as I thought asleep Mitta Aitlitu show is asleep or myself was a few minutes after I had wished my daily good night Pheicwis a light in Mr Balcombe's study as I pulled my blinds down , he often sat up till late in the morning woke up with the sound of the clock striking in my ears I counted the strokes from one to twelve It was midnight I was such a sound sleeper that after counting 12 o'clock I was surprised to find myself naval o and I caught myself was doing that it was the sinking of the hour that had aroused the Gusts of wind was sweeping round the walls of the villa It must have been the wind that disturbed me I thought, and I was on the point of falling asleep again when another sounds unusual one-made me jump up in bed, wide awake It was like a heavy object falling from a height within the grounds 'Can it be Tobias I thought, ' climbing the gates, and missing their footing I was not if paid but I thought it as well to wake my husband who was in the soundest of sleeps I told him what I had heard, and he looked out of the window, and said there was nothing to be seen but a light in our innate s study ' He is up and awake,' said my husband, what you heard was the wind Robbers ! 'there has not been a robbery in the neighbour hood of tim ty years I pity the robber that tried to pass our dogs. There, let me go to sleep and don't disturb me again with your fancies and get to sleep yourself as quick as you can ; now your head is stirring, you to be fancying all sorts of things ' In another moment he was snoring But I found it was not an easy matter getting to sleep union myself I lay thinking, half awake and half asleep I was glad my husband had mentioned the dogs, he was quite right, any stranger trying to pass them would have been torn to pieces Well, but there was somebody walking on the gravelled path, I hear the soft footsteps crunching the stones, not hurriedly but softly and with caution, as though fearful of disturbing the people in the house These sounds came between the gusts of wind, which were growing stronger and stronger Then it occurred to me that it must be my master, who, unable to sleep and disturbed in his mind, was walking about the grounds Contented with this explanation, I was soon asleep-for how long I did not know, for suddenly I found myself sitting up in my bed again listening to the wind, and with a confused impression that a gun had been fired I was trembling all over, but my husband was sleeping peacefully I listened, and hearing nothing more sense led myself out of my fears, the rest of the night passed without further disturbance " But it was not entirely fancy, for in the morning a stumgcdiscovay was made Our two dogs were dead poisoned None of the servants could furnish any information, not one had been disturbed but myself Mr Balcombe was as calm as usual, and the only explanation we could think of was that a robbery had been pi ned, and that the robbers had poisoned the dog but being hurt by a fall from the will find none a day without carrying out their design There was nothing missing from the house. When I spoke to Mr Balcombe about my waking up in the night and the sounds I had heard, he said it must have been chiefly imagination on your part. Denise I was up and awake till i o'clock, and should know about the matter more than you Keep your fears to -\ ourself and next time you are disturbed branch fancies and see a light in my window, rest satisfied that all is well I would not speak much of it if I were in your place' I took his advice, and after a little while the affair was forgotten "So the years went by in the lonely Mile without any changes My lady grew into the habit of taking have all s later in the night, and novel a word is exchanged between her husband and herself So oppressive was this state of things that the servants left one by one, and I daresay 11 myself should have asked to be relieved from thf".i»i\ue had it not been for w\ affection for mv mistress To live with her is I did torrens without growing to love her was not possible He gentleness ha resigna- tion, he resolution were almost beyond belief with those who were not daily witnesses of his lonely, blameless, suffering life She nova The sole right of publication in Queensland or The House of White Shadows has been purchased the Brisbane Newspaper Company, Ira! tod. winter received a letters 11s ^h^lf,aTy from the world, and these loom s was then living grave She loved her child, but. she held her love in control, and did not give wayward violent demonstration of feeling 11 "ml^\\.s.co that, as the lid pa me up, he was bow and.""
