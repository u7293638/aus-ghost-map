MINING INTELLIGENCE. A party of tlio names of Smith, Singleton, and | Co. have, we are informed, after sinking to a con siderable depth on a reef on Tipperary Gully, struck gold heavily on the north dip, and are now busy in securing tho shaft in ordor to commence active operations. 0a.vfxock.—A considerable rush was made yesterday to the Hard Hills, some half-a-mile distant from Havelock. The sinking is shallow, but very hard. We are given to understand that the prospectors obtained 4 dwts. to a tub, and have two feet of waslidirt. Wo are glad to say that there are signs of improvement throughout tho entire district. More gold was offering on Satur day last than has been for some months past.— M. and D. Advertiser. An accession to the population of M'Intyre's has taken place from Jordaus and Jericho, which are just now in something like their death throes, and if tho present depopulation continues are likely soon to yield up the ghost. By the bye, what a splendid chance for our "mile square" gentlemen. If the present " unoccupied" ground is supposed to be " worked out," then indeed is there a capital field for their operations in this extensive district.—M. and D. Advertiser. Wild Dog lwd, true to its wonted style, again shown signs of languishment and dullness, and the fearful catastrophe of last week added to the gloom which had already began to prevail. On Thursday, however, some parties went into a de serted shaft anvl commenced driving; they shortly succeeded in obtaining a 20 oz. 2 dwt. nugget, and 7 dwts. from two tubs of wash dirt. This, added to several other finds, is likely again to inspire new life in!o the "wild dogs," and the rush J may yet lead to important results. -Ibid.
