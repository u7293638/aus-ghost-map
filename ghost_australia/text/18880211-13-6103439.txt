THE AUSTRALIAN IN ASIA AND EUROPE. BY J. H. MYCENÆ AND ITS TREASURE. A GREEK GOLD MINE. The silver mines of Grecian Laurium be- long to the past, but the wondrous gold mine of Greece is of latter-day discovery. The mining adventurers have been Dr. and Mrs. Schliemann, the lady having a goodly share in the discoveries so generally accredited to her husband's name. The scene of the labours of Dr. Schlie- mann and his hard-working wife have been at Mycenæ, but a few hours' distance, and that mostly by railway, from the capital. There is no actual need, however, to visit the barren rocks, and to see there scarcely a ruin among the general desolation, where "Tho owl, the jackal, and the lizard keep Their courts where monarch gloried—and drank deep." The museum of the Grecian capital furnishes a substitute Therein is contained the pro duct of the labours and marvellous luck of this singular pair of explorers The Schhemanns stand first as workers in the waj s of the rabbit and the mole, and not less successfully in Greece than they were in thelroad What Schliemann was in a pre vious form.of existence may never be known, but suspicion points to a platypus He is first of his order in hia present condition, und stands as king of all diggers up to now Sir Samuel and Lady Baker were not greater na travellers and in their Nile discoveries than have been the worthy Schhemanns m their underground labours Looking at these one might address the Dr almost in the words Hamlet uses to his father a ghost, " Well done old mole ! who works in the earth so w eli ? A worthy pioneer ! ' Having finished up their Troy diggings some strange notion led the Schliemanns to follow the conqueror and destroyer of Troy to his kingdom and grave he at Mycenie The probability of making any find of value there was absolutely nil The ground had .been worked over by previous prospectors for at least 3 000 years past, Yet the find was made and exceeded by far the highest expectations The site of Mycenæ is a rocky ruin, and its sole attraction to travellers arc vaults in its stony Acropolis, where is situate-that which is called by some the tomb of Agamemnon, and by other legends the treasuries of Atreus and his sons Even Lord Elgin, in his spare-nothing way, had been foiled Ihe employed his excavators here, but all to a no discovery end. And there waa really nothing else to expect from spacious, empty, and unhghtcd under ground vaults, partly cut out of the rock and lined with strongest masonry. These are Egyptian tomb like in the massive doorway and dome shaped interiors Any sarcophagi they ever contained had, as with those in the chambers of the Egyptian pyramids, long since been removed The lining of the walls, seemingly of copper, had been all stripped off, and the vaults left for a dwell ing place to darkness, bats, and lizards There was the consideration also, with sensible people, that nothing of value would likely be buried with one dying as did Agamemnon When a husband is murdered by his wife and her paramour, his treasures are not usually buried with him The "old nuisance ' being thus got out of the way, his possessions are customarily put to very lively uses, and to no burial purpose beyond the payment of the undertakers bill And set the Schliemanns with the instinct of truffle-hunters' dogs, went straight from 'Troy to the traditional tomb of its con queror There, truly enough, had been buried with him much of the golden treasure he brought home, together with that un fortunate Trojan the young Cassandra. As he found that his Queen, Clytemnestra, had made an Enoch Arden of him while away, it is not easily understood—by the masculine mind—why she objected to her lord bringing home the latter part of his spoil He was the more injured party, but women never will reason or listen to it—in such cases 'The conqueror of Troy was, therefore, by his wife and her Enoch Ægisthus, knocked on the head and put away under the rocks here with Cassandra, and, as it has turned out, much of the other Troy treasure In a corner of the great vault at Mycenæ the Schliemanns came upon an earthy mound, and dug away below it for 21ft At this depth they found nearly a score of graves in which skeletons had crumbled Not so, however, the treasures buried with them, and. found in masses of gold, golden masks nnd breast . plates, and golden vases and ornaments in profusion All of it is to be seen in one of the museums of Athens, and to it the diggers' phrase of "jewellers shop might be more fitly applied than to anj Aus tralian gold find yet made The whole show ism wonder one Full and detailed accounts of these Myce næan discoveries have been published by the Schliemanns in four languages 'Hint in German is by Brockhaus, of Leipsic 'Hie french one is b) Hachette, of Paris 'Hie American one by Scnbner, of New \ ork, and the 1 nglish one by Murra), of London In the catalogued inventory of the various things found, as published by Brockhaus, the numbers run to between 700 and bOO-a large find indeed, and a valuable one in muny aspects Itaffords sufficient furnishing for any museum not intended to fatigue visitors, BB museums will too often do The ordinary visitor will view these treatures with surprise, env), and kleptomaniac feelings I he travel li.r will notice that the ancient Greeks were like the rudo Vikings, in thus having their earthly treasures buried with them 'J hat people sO dissimilar in everything should have had this custom in common is certainly curious In a Johnsonian worded sentence it may be sald, "Let those who would enrich the world and benefit it by discoveries take heed ero they make the attempt. 'j hey will bring npon them that trouble which Sir John 1 al Btaff tclls-of the detraction which will not willingly allow of honour to any one. Columbus lind to endure it, and Sir Walter Raleigh nnd Warren Hustings, and a Bcore of other world benefactors 'IIna trouble falls upon Schhemann even now in this period of war, siege, nnd blockade Troubles never como ulone, nnd critics take this time, of all others, to decry these discoveries bytne worthy explorer, nnd to sa) that he has deceived himself and is deceit tug; others They say that he is assign nig the ownership of tho treasures to the wrong man-that they never belonged to Agamemnon nor to any other one of that name. 'They won t say to whom else they could have belonged, but will have it that Schhemann cannot rightly identify them with the conqueror of 'Troy, or even with his times 1 trat in tina onslaught is the learned American, who haa lived hore for long time and represents, as special correspondent, the leading journal of 1 urope His arguments ure produced in many issues of his paper, and «re very ¡earned and strong and long Dr Schliemann acema to hav e nocliance in reply If ho cannot produce one of the deceased s f umily or executors Not even a claimant cornea forward, however, nor an) one, asking for the property on the strength of a pedigree, and the disputo has no satisfactory end-the Schhemanns stiel ing to Agamemnon, and declining to go to arbitration And these unearthed treasures ma) as well be assigned to Agamemnon ns not Cleo patra'a needle was nevor hers, nor was Pompo)'a pillar evor his. Half the things nccrcdited to the ancients arc aa fabulous as tho virtues accredited to the modern world on their monuments A little matter of a thousand j ears ia one of the questions in- volved in tina dispute A comical aspect is given to tho controversy hy the now com monly debated question whother any Aga niemnon over lived or died-whether Homer didn't iuvent him and tho siege of Iroy also, and all tho heavenly and earthly host mixed up with it But now to other mattera, pre liminary to other scenes Though we tiavo surpassed Greece in literature, and Homer in Shakspeare, we have not distanced the Grecians in our national sports. In horse racing, cricketing, and all other of our sports, the winners can- not compare-in the honours won-with what were awarded to the victors in the Olympian games. We have no winner of anything who ia brought back to the capital in such triumph, crowned and begarlanded with olive, received there with acclamations by the citizens, to bear the heralds proclaim hia name, lineage, and exploits, to be fol- lowed by hearing the ode which poet Pindar, the laureate of Olympia, would make to his renown-to be further followed by the statues to be erected to his memory, by having the foremost seat given to him everywhere in public, and to being freely provided for by the Btate for the rest of a glonued and lazy life Iho nearest approach made in modern times to this Greek way of doing honour ia seen m the Londoners' way of dealing annu- ally with their lord mayor He is taken, in Olympian hero style, garlanded with a gold chain, from London to Westminster, and there produced before the judges The herald, represented by the town clerk, fashionably known as the recorder, then and there recites the name, lineage and doings of this one of London s citizens who has, in one way or another and seldom sole'y by merit, pushed Himself to the front He is then and for a twelvemonth to come, given the free run of the Mansion house, the privi lege of cnfr-rtaining the Premier and any lion like visitor to London also the first Beat on ita magisterial board, and a monetary allowance for his one year of oflice 1 hat is the whole of it, for after his term expires this first man of the modern citizens is as forgotten as is any American or 1 rench President, nor docs any Btatuc usually com memórate him Thoughts such as these, mixed up with mach talk have been preliminary to a visit to Olympia, with a call to be made at Castri on the way The latter is of consequence to the traveller, because that Castri, mean village as it is, stands where stood the famous Delphi and its Oracle-a place which was to old Greece as ita treasury and proudest temple combined 'Hie wealth of the country waa etored there, and thither re paired the rulers of the land to consult the priCBtcss who delivered the oracles-the mcsB⩾ of the gods-to all inquirers It was a singular combination of Mammon and Gammon, of which Delphi was not, however, singular in the possession Something Bimilar was to be found in other places, and is probably yet to be found, in Bome varied form, existing somewhere in the world A belief in the Oracle has, among all the faiths which have had their day, been one which commands respect A remnant of it is still seen in those who consult Bib) Is and trance mediums T here was, in the Grecian Oracle, something boldly direct and straight forward in the claim thuB Bet up for private communication with the gods, lo have Buch a telephonic access as thiB Pythia, or priestess of Delphi, was believed to have to Apollo is something staggering to those of little faith and these latter days It was going a point higher than our appeal to the Privy Council It must have tended to give decision of action thus to get our intentions approved or otherwise right oil by the highest authority The elder Mill instructed his son John Stuart, that all faiths were but fashions, and bad but their da) in illustration of which he wonld name this belief of the Greeks as one, among a score of others, winch had shared such fate. Max Mullers studies have lett little doubt as to India first cradling a super natural belief in the worship of the ele menta, and afterwards of the supposed embodiments of them But to Greece belongs the perfection of the Oracle, and the spread of a national faith that way Uther nations had attempted interpreting supernatural communications as clumsily done as aro the ruppinga of pretended spiritists, hut the Grecian Oracle was a finished performance 1 he Delphic one was more grandly lodged than was ever any Pope, and might be consulted hy all comers Preference was given to those who brought the biggest bribe. When the desired answer bad been obtained from Apollo by the priestess it waa of little use to its seeker until inter preted by the attendant priests. It meant anything or nothing until that was done, and it was generally shaped by them to suit ctr cumstances. bome specimens of these answers have been preserved lo one who sought advice on a matrimonial project the answer was that, murry or not, the repentance of either course was equally certain-an answer as vague aa that given on the same subject to one of the gentler sex, that the tying of the knot prevented the slipping through of the thread Castri ia situated in a valley at foot of Mount Parnassus, two of the spurs of which form a background to the dirty little village The conjunction of these ranges supplies the mountain stream which furnished the famous Castihan Fountain.

And it is by her literature that Greece lives and will live triumphantly for ever-a literature o£ fable, fancy, and other such brain work only, but yet of greatest influence and interest roi lowing the wondrous doings of gods and goddesses in their own sphere are the ac counts of their deeds upon earth when mixed, and very much mixed, with mortals This unreal style ot narration stuck to the Greeks all through thetr details of wars and mighty deeds-all told with touches of ex travaganza. Fable and fancy tincture every thing and the real is now indistinguishable from the imaginary Iheir battles mid vic tones, their achievements by land and sea with the numbers of those engaged in them must bo taken aa are their accounts of the Olympian games One of the athletic com petitors in these contents is seriously credited with an impossible long jump equivalent to 60(t of British lineal measurement How the Greeks honoured intellect in its literary form was shown in the elevation of Sophocles to the governorship of Samos for the writing of ."Antigone ' only This tragedy had but a run of thirty two nights on its production, and in England or America would net but little in that time for its author and in that little would be all of his reward So esteemed wns 1 unpides that slat es were freed who could leam and repeat scenes from his dramas. yLsop collected the stray fables of the land as Joe Miller collected English jests, and it was Socrates' leisure hour labour to attempt the turning of these into verse. The Greeks seem to have followed intellectual amusements- attended lectores and debates everywhere, and dis cussed philosophical questions as we now do alcohol and tobacco They are to be excused, however, as having no newspapers We wait for the boat at Itea, the port of Delphi, which is to take us on to katokolo, the landing place for Olympia. The long watt has been utilised in noting in this way one s ¡deas about Greece and the characteristics of its people. The news now comes that the expected boat will not arrive-the blockade has detained it We take advantage, there fore, of a coasting vessel by which to return We tbuB lose the sight 01 the ruins of Jupiters temple, scattered by an earthquake and of the Bcene of the Olympian games covered up by many feet of mud left by an accompanying inondation Comfort about the disappointment can be taken in the philosophic spirit of the fox with the grapes-if one of those notedly carnn orous animals ever aid take to longing for such un likely diet It is hard indeed to be so situated as to go to a meeting oi Parliament as a matter of amusement There is no knowing however to what any of us may come. Lord Tomnoddy and Sir Carnaby Jenks came as low down as going to Old Bailey executions m their search for novelties. 1 he momentous question of peace or war for Greece is to be decided by a special meet- ing of Parliament called for that purpose. I am advised that this modern representation of the open air assembly which of old met on Mars Hill will be worth visiting '1 brough the courtesy of a " special correspondent ' a card of admission is obtained, and I find that there is no need to ask the way I have but to lollow the crowd adown the streets, on each Bide of which the soldiery are keeping guard. It is indeed a day " big with the fate of Crcsar and of Rome, ' or rather of Greece, and seems to be so recognised generally Courtesy is shown to me as a stranger and foreigner, and I am allowed to pass un questioned through the soldier guarded gates and the officially kept doors by which the deputies are now making their way at 10 turn 'lue council chamber I find to be fashioned like a Greek theatre, judging of the shape by what was Been in that wuy I bad, I recalled, talked jestingly with my guide at the theatre of Bacchus as to the fît ness ot such a place for a Purhament house little thinking then that I should see the existing one of Athena, so similar in appear unce Bave as to roofing The ceiling is coffered, and its compart menta decorated in gold and colours.

Hie table is covered with a white cloth, and upon it is laid the crosier and a basin holding water A solemn service of prajer now cora menees the president first changing his red fe/.zi for a black cap and the whole assembly standing Previously to the prayer a " roll call ' ot the deputies takes place the clerks at the table taking down the names of those present '1 he service of prayer lasts a quarter of an hour, the golden robed ecclesiastic reading from no fewer than four splendidly bound volumes and his assistants joining in the responses At the conclusion he dtps a bouquet of green leaves in the basin of water and with it walks out from the table, Bprinkling with the watered leaves those seated m the front row of benches lins front row is divided midway by the main passage running up facing the pre etdents chair to all the ascending semi circles of seats 'Hie high priest now re turns to the table and gives a short bene diction which concludes the service Hie priests each hold long red lighted tapers, branching oil into three lieiuls at half way up the stems V) hen the service of prayer ia over these tapers arc extinguished the coloured mantles are taken off, and the weurers resume their Butts as before in their black {.owns only and their e\er present black hats Hie deputies also again cover their heads as they tal e their seats Hie President ou seating himself dolls the black cup and ayiin dons his fez/i In the front row of Beats it is easy to identify the late Premier DehyanniB from the many portraits and caricatures Been of lum, but I have to ask for ineoupis, his predecessor to be pointed out to me us also Vulvle, the one who has been called to the formation of the now Ministry Iho latter looks aged and of feeble appearance, hardly the man for the occasion to which he has been called He now mounts the tribune stand fronting the President, and, with his bucle to the ' chair, reads the order of the day calling Purhament together, after which ho resumes his seat 'Hie President then announces that the election of a permanent president will now be proceeded with, and that strangers in the body of the House, of whom I am one, will have to withdraw An ad journment of half an hour takes place and I now leave the House altogether, having thus seen the preliminary business ot this most im portant one of Greek parliaments, and wish ing it well through in its most difficult labours It is quite refreshing to get again into the streets, and away from parlia ment and politics 'Hie vote of the Assembly will likely be taken before the night is over, but whether or not it is known already how it will go, and that the peace party will be in the majority 'Hie requisite orders will then issue for dia arming the troops, and then, the necessary guarantees being given, tho meti-of war will be withdrawn by their different Governments, and the blockade be raised Of this, I may consider, I have seen both the beginning and the ending and have had my time in Greece during one of the many momentous periods of iU woudrousb momentous history.
