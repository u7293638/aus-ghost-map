WESLEYAN. The Rev. R. Bavin, organising secre tary of the Century Fund, preached here on Sunday morning and evening to large congregations, and at Cungegong based upon the story of the Saviour being exal ted to the right hand of God and the out pouring of the Holy Ghost ; in the evening his subject was Greeks who came to Philip and said : ' We would see Jesus,' a story extraneous' to Bible records. He drew important lessons from these, and the discourses were of an impressive and eloquent nature. He was announced to address a public meeting on Tuesday night, in the Wesleyan Church on his special mission. The local . body need only Â£200 to clear off every item of debt.
