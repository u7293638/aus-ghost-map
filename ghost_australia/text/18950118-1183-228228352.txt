Next day all England was laughing at tho wily Barrett's mare's nest ; but, as they laugh who win, nobody found tho detective's failure so entertaining as Skinoor, who stood to pocket a fsir sum by the escape of tho murderer. But 3kinner's laugh diod out lator whon Griffiths staggered into the club and called for brandy. 'What's tho matter 1 What has hap pened! You look as if you had Been a ghost.' fteiflitfia xulin hnri Rtn<rrQrcd to tho liGftrGSt chair, only nodded, until ho bad taken a great gulp of neab brandy, whon ho gasped, 1 1 have !' I You have 1 You have what 1' I I have scon a ghost — his ghost 1' 1 Whoso ghost I What tho devil lias happened ?' Spaight — I'vo scon Spaight's ghost as plain as I see you. Hero, that will do! You've had quito enough of that,' said Marsden, taking the glass out of his hand. 1 I'm not drunk, and I'vo not imagined it. I b&w; him as plain as I see you there.' As tho lad was evidently neither drunk nor dreaming, thoy waited breathlessly for his tale. He said ho had just been to tho docks to see his cousin on board tho Australian liner Tasmania. Having gone with him on board and stayed to see his quarters, and havo a farewell talk, he quitted the ship only at tbo Inst boll. Just as ho was leaving it, Spaight absolutely rushed by him on board by the samo gang way. lie had no more donbt of its being Spaight or his ghost than ho had of his own existence. He shouted after him twice Spaight !' and he turned round instinc tively, but instantly avortod his faco and dived down into tho cabin. Then Griffiths had to clear tbo gangway, but he stood for Borno time on tho quny, staring after the Tasmania as she glided out into tho river, and must havo said aloud what was in his amazed mind : 'It was Spaight and no one oIbo,' for a man beside him, who had watched the sceno of the encounter on tho gangway, asked, ' Who did you say, sir, that Ulan WUo I opuiguu, wg uinu wuw nun supposed to havo been murdered by Brough.' 'Phew I Are you quite sure, sir T 'Quite,' Then, having explained that he was a doccctivo, who hnd gone on board to look out for Brough, 'lie asked,' continued Griffiths, 1 for my name and address, and 1 gavo the club as my address. What is tho meaning of it, boys T Thoy were in tho middle of a discussion about its meaning when a police inspeator called to carry off Griffiths to the Tasmania — whioh had been stopped by telegraph furtbor down tho rivor — for tho identification of Spaight. He took with him not only Giiffiths but tho Colonel and Skinner, and explained to them his theory of Spaight's resurrection. 1 He's the man that's wanted, gonts ; not Brough,' as though tho only poo- plo wanted in this world wero those ' wanted ' by tha police. ' Spaight done Brough ; not Brough, Spaight, Ho shot the Australian, oxchangud clothes with him, and then laid his head on the line that his face might be smashed up into pulp. Tho body was identified as Spnight's only by tho clothes and tlio papers in their pookets; and its my belief, gonts, that it was something in them papers that started Spaight for Australia.' It was tho failure of tlio police to find a man so identifiable ns Brough no less than Griffiths's identification of Spaight which suggested this theory to the inspector, while Spaight's embarassmont and shady antece dents made it probable to tho Colonel and Skinner. None of tho throe clubmen relished the idcaof being the immodiato means of bringing bia old club mate to tho gallows, liut Spaight's suioido on board tho Tasmania upon learning the reason of the arrest of the vessel in the river spared them this ordeal. That he committed tho murder was -boyond a doubt, and his reasonB for com mitting it wore hardly less doubtful, since it wss discovered that ho had lost as heavily as he rkas supposed to havo won at the racos.
