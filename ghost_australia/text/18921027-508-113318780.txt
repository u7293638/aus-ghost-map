' But why Bhould Jaofc Hetheridge iiaVe ?wanted to do you an. injury?' asked Red wood. 'That's more ttan I can tell you, : matey,' Potter replied. , ♦' The only tiling I know is, he done it.' 'How did you know him?' Bed wood asked. « What brought you im Me liousep' . 'I don't remember,' was the unexpected answer. 'There'g heaps of things I can't remember.' He giseed his hand across his brow again, rubbing it; heavily, as it by the mere physical pressure he hoped to efcraighten the inward tangle. 'No,' he eaid, hopelessly, ' I can't remember.' He loeked at Kedwood with an eye altogether vacant, and the yeoman feared that he had made acquaintance with a madman. He had had no experience of that genus, and he thought it reasonable to try and argue Potter out of what seemed an obvious hallucination. 'You say,' he began, 'that you saw Hetheridge six weeks after he was reported dead?' . ' Yes,' said Potter,; ' that's the truth.' ' Did you think it was his ghost ?' ' No j it was him right enough. Ghosts can't hit a chap and put him into hospital for 12 months. The back of my head was all bashed in like, Matey.' ' What motive could he have ?' ' Oh, he had motive enough. You make your mind easy about - that, Matey.*1 ' Well, what was it P' « My head goes wrong,' said Potter. ' I i get. it sometimes all a/s dear aa daylight, . and then it goes away again. There's only one thing as I don't forget. I never forget as it was Mr. John Hetheridge- that done ; it. I shall find him some day, and when I - -find him I shall have bis life.' Ml this was, of course, to Redwood's mind, the merest madness. There was no reason for giving the poor man* a story so much aa a moment's credence. It was: doubtful if he were even the man he sup posed himself v to be. To fancy he ;wa.s Iteynolds's heir and nephew might easily be as dreamy and. unreal as the rest. He sat thinking thus, puffing his pipe in silence, and had begun to consider how it would be easiest politely to diBmiss his curious guest when Potter struck the table with a heavy hand. ' I've got it,' he said almost passion ately. 'It was all about Bob Martin' b little gell. Bob was my pal, and it was iuj eight to take charge of hie little gell.when lie got murdered. Now I put that to any honest man, if it wasn't a pal's right more than a stranger's to take charge of a -matey's kid when he got murdered ?' Had Redwood known the story he would have followed Potter easily, but as it was the man's speech sounded like the merest gibberish, ?; '' : ' I said to him^ look her©,* I- says,'* it's this way, matey,. 4^eco^e'iii.¥ for 'nay. pro perty, and nie and my missises goin' to England by the ship as sails tuUiighfc. I shall Hud my matey'a- child,' I told him/ * if it costs me every penny in thb world.' You mind that, I says- « I shall find her whithersoever she may be/ With that I turns my back on him and he knocks my brains out. I remember it now/' he con cluded, ' as well as if j.t were yesterday.' Kedwood was unaffectedly sorry for the poor fellow, but little disposed to give cre dence to any of his fancies. ' I suppose,' he saidf after- thinking ^or a while, ' that you' came thrtmgbT Lon don ?' * ' Yes,' replied Potter. ' Well, did you call on your late uncle'a lawy er ?' Potter shook his head. ' I sup pose you know who he is?' ' It's slipped my mind, somehow. X don't remember.' . . '?',.'. ' Well, as it happens,' Eedwood said, ** I do. I'll write his address down ior you* There's a telegraph office only three milpfl away at the railway station. You walk over there in the morning and send & mes sage to the lawyer. You ask him if he knows where your wife is. Thaf s the best thing for you to do, yOu know,' * ' Yes,' said Potter, j' that's the thing to do.' CHAPTER XL ; 'Drink Fair.' ' Potter had carried such effects as he had 'vriLth him to the Blaok Bull, and at that decent hostelry he took up his residence for the time being. _? He told his story to anybody who would listen to him, but never succeeded in making it more intel ligible than it had seemed to Redwood. W hat with his naturally thundering style of narrative and his lapses of memory he; succeeded for the most part in working his hearers' minds in a complete tangle, and |the universal xmp,iea6ioni.;WaB fcha;g fee vw.aS:- crazy, and that his story was without foundation.; His own. inaction gave color to the general opinion. He took no steps to communicate with the lawyer whose address Redwood had given him, and made no attempt to discover the whereabouts of his wife in any other way. He loafed about the village, sometimes unreasonably hilarious and ... communicative wi^a strangers, sometimes.. morosely uncivil at intrusions he had himself invited, but generally in a patient stupor which would have- been pitiable it his true story and condition .bad Veen known. One thing was abundantly clear to the village intelligehW Potter's -- 'story ? o£ Hetheridge* a reappearance was mad absolutely and definitely jnadVv'IJo:. man who waB alive to prevent if'Hco^ft:j^^feljfr- ' allow estates-sb - jaat :.::~&b; ;^ /BJei^rMge^ ?j^d^ left behind 'him .to pasd i '-away i&cpj;&^a&s-;? possession.

It shad ;, not, be*n .thought __ the- .right thing to do this in solitude, »&-*' *b.fc'Hju6 tomary manner -was «ith«jr to select a' com rade or comrades .with whom to get drunk, iand Jceep drunk till the .whole of the money was expended, or to '* shout ' indiscrimi nately for any houseful of loafers the moneyed man might light upon. For the first five or six ' days of his stay the Australian was but an unprofitable client to the Bull. He had sorprised the landlord by egregious ordera for cold tea, whioh he drank by the quarfc. It was made up of an unheard of strength and bitter ness to suit his palate^ and formed the only liquid refreshment he indulged in. He -was known, however* to have a pocket full of money, a gold watch and chain, and some other valuables, and since he insisted on paying up his score with absolute regularity before breakfast, his whims were respected, and he was permitted, though not without some grumbling, to have his way. ? Tramps of all sorts passed through the village, which lay midway between two union workhouses, and. in these shabby wayfarers Potter took a curious interest. It is probable that they reminded him of the swagnien who had for uo many years been familiar to him. He scanned the : tribe day by day as if he were searching for Borne special man amongst them, and at last he seemed to find him. He stopped a burly, jovial looking blackguard iu the dusty road. ' ' Morning, matey,' said Sam. 'How's things with you ?' . ' Pretty bad,' said the tramp. , ' Looking out for a job?' Sam asked. 'You got one to offer?' the tramp re torted. - 'Yes, I have.' « What is it f'. the trfenip inquired, with all the caution of his tribe. He was not so madly anxious to get work that he was willing to set his unaccustomed hands to any unspecified labor chance might offer them* : - ' I want a man,' said Sam* with perfect gravity, ' to drink fait along- o' -me. ' 'On,' jeered the tramp, suspecting mockery in this simple and natural state ment.' ' What's the wages ? j ' A dollar a day,' Sam responded. j The tramp stared hard at him, hut there was no light of humor in Sam's eye. The offer seemed too heavenly to be real, and yet the man who made it looked sincere. 'A dollar a day,' said the tramp. ' To drink fair along o' you. I'm On. I'll take the first day's wages in advance, and I'm ready to begin at once.' . . ^ ! There was a little trembling hope in the tramp's bosom, the least infantile fluttering beginning of a hope that this amazing offer might be real. But he seemed to feel his heart turn over when the solemn stranger drew out a handful of gold arid silver from his pocket, selected two half-crowns from j the glittering pile, and dropped them in his | outstretched palm. ' .: '' '. . I ' Now, mind you, matey,' said Sam ] Potter, 'you're in\ny'-Beryifle as long as I this chea ue lasts. You've got to drink fair, you understand that. There's to be no greed and there's to be no shirking. : Fair piay-''^etvfeeu'~man--;iand----man is what I expect and what I look f ©rrad to.' The tramp bound himself by a grisly eath, and Potter led the way, well pleased with himself and his man; Oh his way to the Bull he paused at the village iron monger's, and by way of .giving an air of Australian reality to the. solemn festival on which he was ,about to enter bought two tin pannikins. One of these he gave to the tramp and he himself carried the other. «*What do you, say to rum to begin with P' Sam a#ked» as they walked on side by side. - | The tramp, Whose brightest hopes nad not carried him 'beyond the limits of six ale, turned faint at this glimpse of heaven. ' Yus,' he said meekly, ' Fve nothing to say agen rum to begin with.' ; His spirit quailed within *»™ at the thought that rarer and more elysium splendors might await him. . They entered the hoaee and eat down together in the taproom, and; Sam having j called for a bottle of rum -and paid for it on the nail, they began solemnly to drink together. There was no unseemly revelry about the business, but all was done decently and in order. .;. Plug tobacco and mfctches in plenty were providedy and the two sat in silence, thetraipp keeping an observant eye on Sam ajid oGniking when he drank, and oh, he thought, if this might last for ever. ^ At noon they left the room for steak and onions, and the twanp was blessed beyond the measure of mortal man. . ; - In the wilds Vnich through, long use had come to eeem native i.- .to him, Sam would have found no one to interfere with his freak, but he found t£e English folk conservative and ill inojuied towards inno vation. The landlordistepped in in the course of the evening and.jput a etop to Supplies. The tramp becarneftbusive, and was given in ^harge.^ f$*- &&&&** inarticu lately protestant, waB puit to bed, and by this means the orgie was 'brought to. a speedy close. But p-K-r' Sam, like so many of his class, found it impossible to leave oil: drinking when he had once begun, and mooned boozily in the i^prpom or bar parlor all day long; ? -He 'vtras parfectly quiet and inoffensive, but willing to buy drinks for all the world, and the landlord began to have a certain esteem for him.

He felt a little natural pride ia bis own | accomplishment, and his neighbors were (distinctly proud of him as of a man who, could do Upnor justice in foreign parts if ever it should please fate to carry him so far. It was true that Redwood disclaimed an intimate knowledge of ? the French tongue, and professed only the most modest ; pretensions in regard to it, but this was i looked on as a mere personal characteristic, j He was none of your bragging fellows was | Redwood. A straightforward, honest chap, ; who never laid claim to anything in/par- j ^ticulari and whose performance wasalwayB j a litter better than his promise. ' The landlord had set the tun dish in the neck of old Andre's bottle, and was just about to pour into it a measured pint of brandy when Sam Potter shouldered clumsily into the room. ; ' Look*here, mateys,' he began thickly, I 'who says I'm a liar? Where the man amongst you ? Let him stand up and have it out fair and square, like a man.' i There was no answer, and everyone felt \ the episode a little awkward. ] u It was you, wasn't itP' Potter asked, turning upon Redwood. ' It was you as said I was a liar.' ' My , good fellow,' Redwood answered, ' I said nothing of the kind. I daresay you believe everything you say, but I don't thiiik you quite know what you're; talking about.' ' Don't I ?' Potter returned. .*' You come outside and we'll see about that before you can say knife.' He began to pull off his coat, but was immediately surrounded. ' Come, now, Mr. Potter,' said the land lord. ' There's nobody in this house that wants to quarrel with you, and I'm sure you don't want to quarrel with nobody. A peacef uller or amiabler gentleman, drank or sober, as tke case may be, I never made the aquaintance of. You don't want to quarrel, Mr^ Pottpr?^ ' ' At this combined tribute and appeal Sam became instantly mollified. He shook hands all round, and proposed the most Christian sentiments to all the world. ! ' Yourve got me matey,' he told the landlord* *'? You've described me proper. : There aint a man alive as can say Sam Potter jever ''harmed' a fly, nor yet he wouldn't. Now what are we all a-going to take to drink P* , ' Now come, come, Mr. Potter,' cried the '? landlord, patting him comfortably on the '? back, 'you've took a little more than's good for you already. You go and have a little bit of a -stretch now in the fresh air, That's the thing to do you good.' ' All right,' «aid placable Sam, and bi4- 1 ding everybody an affectionate good night . he walked out as well as he could into the village street He strolled on vacantly for a minute or two, and then turned to find the bent foreigner shuffling at his heel% j *? Hullo, matey,' he exclaimed,*' you'll come and have a drink, won't you ?' ' Sank you/' the old man exclaimed, ' I veel.' ' That's your sort,' cried Sam, and took him by the shoulder with intent to draw i him back to the Bull. ?' Not zat vay,J' said the old foreigner, 'eisvay.

' I ring a bell, eh ?' He .reached out a shaking hand and pulled at a frail old cord which depended from the ceiling. A cracked tinkle answered from i with out, and -a slatternly girl came in. Sam gave his order and the girl obeyed it, land the two were left alone together. ** 1 like you,' said the foreigner in Mb difficult anidJialting English, ' Nice man, eh P but frighten, oh, too easy frighten.' . ,H ' Whose too easily frightened f' Sam demanded. 1 ' YoUp' said 'tke old foreigner. v . !

He fiuhg; open the door, dived into the passage, and so into the street, the foreigner follow ing with more agility than might have been looked for in him, his newly filled brandy bottle tucked away under his left arm, and his two sticks held together in the right .hand. -\\. v . .-. ? - ? ' You vill be frighten again ven you get sere/' he whispered, but Potter disdained to reply, but forged ahead with gloomy purpose. His will was good, but his pro gress was by no means rapid. Before he -had reached the little hostelry he had walked four or five times the necessary dis tance j .and by the time he passed the door would probably have forgotten all about the purpose which took him there if hie malicious tempter had not been still at his elb'ow.v/' .' ... ' '*' If I was so strong as you,' he said, ' I should kill him.' -The witless Sam rolled royally into the liousli, ia,nd shouted for Redwood. He used dreadful epithets, and was so obviously in1 a state of drunken frenzy that all the men in the establishment fell upon him simul- | taneously, and held Mm from the possibi- I lity of mischief. I ; '« You frighten of 'im,' said th© old ! foreigner, when the hubbub had so far j subsided that he could be heard. 'He not dreadful. Too much frighten himself.' , At this Sam's drunken rage mounted so high, that by a tremendous effort he launched the men who held him right and - left, and, and tearing out of the passage, ? made at full speed for Redwood's house, \ breathing threats and slaughter. -Nobody I followed, end when he had got out fairly j into the country lane his causeless rage ' dAserted him almost at once. TTo fell in+o a hedgerow, and wont contentedly to sleep there for an hour or two, awaking in timf to walk borne just before the hour of closing. The foreigner had made a great to do about following him, aud had even gone out with a pretence of pursuit. It was no more than a pretence however, for at the first corner he made a detour, and shambled away towards his own residence — a lonely cottage half a mile away from the village. (_TO BK-COmXNUiiD.)
