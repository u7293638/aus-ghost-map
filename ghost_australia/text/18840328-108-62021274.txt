How powerful a means must we needs conclude it to be for reforming the manners of mankind and making them truly virtuous ! What mighty encouragement have we set our selves against our sins, and to labour after the perfection of virtue. Though Christ by His death reconciled us to God, and procured a pardon of sin for us: yet the the actual benefit of this reconciliation, the actual application of this pardon, did depend upon our performance of certain conditions, which conditions were that we should mortify all our evil affections, and frame our lives suitable to the laws of the Gospel; but now the grace and power by which we are enabled to do this, was not the effects of Christ's death, but of His resurrection.-Archbishop Sharpe. Shall we suffer sin and vanity to drop in at our eyes and ears, at every corner of our bodies and of our souls, knowing that we are the temples of the Holy Ghost ? Which of you receiveth a guest whom he honoureth, or whom he loveth, and doth not sweep his chamber against his coming? And shall we suffer the chamber of our hearts and consciences to be full of vomiting, full of filth, full of garbage, knowing that Christ hath said, "I and my Father will come and dwell with you l"-Hooker.
