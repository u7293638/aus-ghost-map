The Aborigines of Japan. The Ainus, or aborigines inhabiting northern dis tricts of Japan, are a curious race. Their customs as regards burial are very singular. The Ainus have no cemeteries. Each person chooses a spot for the body of his relative, ana they generally bury fax away in the mountains. Formerly it was. the chief's duty to seek out a bury Lug-place, and to attend to the funeral. The people keep their graves as secret as possible, being, like the members of many other barbarous races, much afraid of the ghosts of the dead. They visit the graves only upon exceedingly rare occasions, or under very* great pressure. Thus Ainu places of burial are very soon forgotten, and the . graves Become quite ipuisunguisname rrom ine loresu around them. Whenever the Ainu finds it necessary to speak of death and burial, as of course it same times must be, they talk with a hushed voice, and use a figurative and roundabout phraseology. Thus death is called ' sleeping,' ' overcome with deep sleep,' ' resting,' ' leaving the world behind,' ' going,' ' gone away,' ** is not.' Even a person's name is to be forgotten when death overtakes him.â€” 1'hrenolcgical Magazine.
