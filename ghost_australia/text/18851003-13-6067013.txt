S.i Tlf/IDA I' OCTOBER 3, ISS"!. Literally, if not figuratively, tho Shops Bill promises us a retuin to the dark ages Tn Collins street the Shops Bill is in force ah cady, toi Collins street does not Irado after 0 o clock, and in this thoroughfare, therefore, 'we lmo a faithful representation of «hat is to be o\ei)whetc Up to n certain houi Collins stieet is the bnghtest anti most lively of our citj avenues, but aftei 0 o'clock, it is dink and dreai, dcsohto and deserted Hie pedestnan in stinctively tunis asido from "the " Blocl," and is to be found in mun bei s wlieie open shops and gas and the electnc light render Bourko-street attiactive Under the act «hen the bill becomes one. tho Collins street conditions will obtain overj where, nnd it may be that the streets will be generally summed, Mci bouino lapsing into tho condition of those Eastern cities, vvlieio no (ino ven- tures out after nightfall 1 ancy descries the ghoul in the J ast, anti thero is tho stern reality of tho robber It is with ewenuig that thcsons of BELI VX, " flushed " with insolence ind wine," put in their appearance *t\ lth Collingwood and Hothim in gloom, one can imagine the larrikin hete indulging m lus pin) ful pi inks, and remaining ultimately master of the sjstem Hut no ono can posi tively forecast the appea raneo of a city with every shop, except the exempted few, compulsonly closed nfttr nightfall, for there lins been nothincr. liko it in the modern woild Hie poet imagines that thero will bo a time when I " Earth cities have no sound or trend, And ships arc drifting with the duud To shores where nil is dumb." But that may not bo tho situation either. Mrs. OLIPHANT, in her novel The Ecleaiyvrcd City, depicts a town taken possession of by the ghosts of departed citizens. Forms nro seen hurrying to and fro in the gloom-soino aimless, some in distress. Something of tho same sort ia to bo witnessed in Bourko-street on Sunday evenings, with a cortain amount of lewdness added. And perhaps theso last illustrations talco us tho nearest to tho reality of tho futuro.' One of the speakers at tho recent Melbourne meeting of protesting shopkeepers, reflecting upon the loss the gas producer will suffer by the non-consumption ¿f his hydro-carbon, ¡carno to the conclusion that the object of certain Ministers in introducing the bill is to pick up gas shares cheap. But this is arguing from a shareholder's standpoint. There is never much money to be made by the permanent deprecia- tion of property. A lise, and not a fall, is the object of tho speculator. Bather it may bo that by way of somo amends for recent legislation there is a willing- ness to enhance hotel property. Each remaining public-houso will stand out as a bright particular star, nn islet of light in an ocean of darkness, and tho pro- prietor may hope that his establishment will become a general rendezvous ac- cordingly. So important a social changa as that proposed was nover taken before with so little discussion, and as the result of so littlo inquiry and agitation. It is true that tho Boyal Commission on Shops took evidence on the subject, but that commission was not ona of Mr. KERFERD'S " high-class courts." It was composed of three or four of the most silly and tho most violent of members of Parliament-Mr. GARDINER repre- senting the one class and Mr. WOODS the other. But even the Shops Com- mission did not go the length of the bill. Indeed, just as ROB HOY remarked that "he has glimmerings of common " sense now and then, that Dougal " creature," so it must bo confessed that Mr. GARDINER wa3 reasonable, nnd that there was an appear- ance of caution about Mr, WOODS. Tho object in view is to reduco the hours of Jabour of shops' assistants, and a highly laudable purpose that is, though one would have thought that success might have been obtained in this department of life, as in others, by the resolution of the emjiloi/in nnd the sympathy of an approving public, But if the Legislature is to interfere, then the S^hops Commission, in its moment of wisdom, saw that thero aro other ways of effecting the object than the proposed heroic 'Step of putting up the shutters all round. Wo can fix the I hours of labour, and say that assistants ' shall not be employed more than eight, nine, or ten hours per day, or not more than 'l8 or 54 or CO hours per week, and the desired result is obtained at once, and with a minimum of inconvenience to the public. A strong pressuro in favour of early closing would bo constantly exercised, but the changes would be gradual, and would bo mado as thoy were found to be feasible, and property would not bo in- jured by sudden diversions of trade. The present proposal is altogether too slavish an imitation of the roast pig procedure of the Chineso epicure. Burning a house down will cook a pig, no doubt, but the luxury of roast pork is to bo obtained without the catas- trophe. Mr. COLE, of Book Arcade celebrity, informs the public that ho has introduced tho .eight hours system into his business. Mr. COLE cannot be hurt- ing man, woman, or child by attending to his avocation under these conditions, and ho naturally fails to seo why he should be compelled to close his bustling emporium at hours other than ho finds convenient to his customers-to his loss and to their detriment. Wo agree that tho miner should not work more than eight hours under- ground, but no one in his senses would propose to restrict gold-getting at tho Madame Berry, or tho Long Tunnel, or the Queen's Birthday mines to tho hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Yet it is on these sapient lines that tho Ministerial bill proceeds. Wo do not know that the measuro will bo thrown out. Peoplo aro strangely indifferent here, and allow themselves to bo "bossed" by any activo clique. If the object can bo de- scribed as philanthropic, no ono likes to object, and few inquiries are made as to whether it is wiso, or whether the tho proper agencies aro being employed. The Legislative Assembly would readily consent to amend tho bill so as to rsgulato tho hours of labour in- stead of defining the hours of trade, but it must bo stirred up from outside if it is to tako any distinct action. So far there is no great agitation, possibly because the bill is notunderstood,or it is not realised how easily all reasonable and proper objects could bo obtained by simpler and less objeetionablo means. If the calm continues, we shall speedily seo in Melbourne what MILTON terms " dark " ness visible," and BENTLEY trans formed into " transpicuous gloom," while in tho country, if a belated traveller enters a village lato and returns home with clothes and stores, the shopkeeper must pay a fine or go to prison. There has been nothing like this since the world began. Curfew did not render buying and selling after sundown penal. Tlieie seems to be a geneial n_,rce mont milong piommcnt liberals in Enghnd to 'bojeott' the Hoya 1 Com mission of Inquiy into tho state of trade which lias been decided upon by Loid SvJisnuitv s Government Mi 1 OKMi i, Mi GoscntN, and Mi SnAW Ii in ni aie all Samaiitans who pass by on the other side, and will not help to binn np tho wounds of tindo in this paiticulni fnsluon '1 ho latest resigna tions and refusals to tike patt in the inquiry, come iiom Mr IN II LUM low i KR, a rising radical MP, and Mr. HENTY 11 OADTIUIIST The former giv e» the set excuse that ' he hld not seen tho " names of the membeis of the commis " sion." befoio giving Ins consent J he latter, who was asked-sot»ewhatlate in tho diy-to servo, declnied that is (ho " cause of labour, in his own person, was the last tiling thought of, he cannot now pardon the aflront The Government has therefoie to fall back on second rate men, m at all events on I men vv lioso names do not cairy much weight ]t is curious to note the reception which the supposed revival ot protec- tion in England meets with among the oilhodox piotectionisls in the United t-tates 'Ihcro is no lcioicing o\ei the anticipated spread of the light among tho Bntishcrs The fact that a tax on American gi am 01 a dis- criminating duty in fnvoui of the British colonies, might po'-siblj bo the result of these new inquines, is kept out of sight bj tho American piotectiomst press when discussing the mattei bomo of then new-ipiper-, however, aver that a tax of tho kind would " cause far moro commotion and pro " duco moio inquiiy in tho luial "districts than even tho Gemían " poik decrees," and that when the English tauft goes up, the United States tariff will go down lins no doubt means that, as Hie snp'eniacy of English manufactures in ?, neutral markets depends on cheapness of pro duction, the Ameiicans will seize the opportunity of any artificial use m the cost of production in England^ to re- move the incubus of a high tanti fiom their own manufacturing industry, and thus secure for their producers the place which England has vacated Similar misgivings as to the results of increased protection may be obseived in the=e colonies The possibility that Now South Wales and South Australia may decide to protect them selves against tho " pauper labour " of Victoria, andngidly exclude our manu factines, is a very disquieting possibility A passage m the speech of Mr H C MUIICKE, the chairman of the Adel nde Chamber of Commerce, at the annual meeting this j ear, shows how moon venicnt it is for colonial manufacturéis to be limited strictly to the homo market Ile said - , "lor many articles that could ho mnnu factured we could not look for an evport trade, and to provide simply for our own market could not pay I et them consider the jam industrj A few jenra <IRO II lorne qunntity of jam was imported into this colon}, nnd a duty of 2d per lb , or 11 per cent, was impoBed \\\ lint wns the rt ault ' I he importation oE jams lind certiunlj been stopped and manufactories lind been stnrte 1 here Kow, at the present time, it Ililli these manufactories «ero in full norlin,; order, half the jam manufactured could not be sold Ile bebet ed the factories were now uorkini; half handed, and o\en then »ere o\er stocked Even the prospect of seeing one's brethren in .Kew South AVales delivered from fiscal bondage by the new Laliouraud Free-thought party in New South Wales would hardly be an equivalent for the ruin of tho profitable export trade which Victorians carry on with that benighted colony at present. Should tho question of protection bo really raised at the forthcoming elections in New South Wales, it will be interesting to learn whether complete prot&Vtion; will bo advocated by the friends of labour, or whether tho working man will be choked oft" with a mere mongrel protection, which ex- tends, only to inanimate manufactured goods. In America it is beginning to be felt in orthodox protectionist ciicles, that after all the only kind of protec- tion which can "savo labour " is a-prohi bitory tariff duty on human beings. The Cleveland Rolling-mill in Ohio has been giving some valuable instruction on this particular point. Three years ago there was a' great strike in tho iron industry in Ohio ; the company quietly locked out the whole of its hands, and supplied their places by Poles, Hungarians, nnd Bohemians Although itself making laige piolita by virtue of the protective tai iff, the coin pany has since 1S83 cut down the wages of tho imported foreign labourers 37Jpei cent, until latterlv the mained men in the company s employ hov e been trjmg to suppoit their families on Id per meal per person, vv hilo tho city in hrmary could not suppoit paupnrs at less than 2]d pel meal A fresh strike has occuired recontly, followed bv nols and the forcible shutting up of the com pany s branch vvoiks by the fullers fudged by tho light of such facts as these, the lmpoitanee of an ad minni duty on labour ought not to bo lost sight of bj tho 1 ree thought and 1 emnn combi nation, which is at present talking of remodelling the fiscal policj of the neighbouring colon) Tew pooplo on this sido of the Mmray hato boon able to mtoiest thcmsehea in tho recont debates in the No« South Wales Assembly, or to mnko " head or "tail" o£ tho ftctious wrangling, per sontl recrimination, and successive "scenes" which ha\o disfigured the Parliamentary proceedings of tho last fou weeks in Sydney Sir A Si HAM'S Goloinmont seem to ha\o decided on a soit of penal dissolution, which li is the suddonnoss of a cotyi dclat ilicy htt\e justified their dismissal of tho Assombly on the grounds that the conduct of tho Opposition was simply mtolerablo, and that tho^ had no choice but to appeal fiom their poisecutois to the constituencies.

With a dissolution at hand the lot of tho member of Pniliamcnt is not altogether a happy one Mun) hate to cut antics in oidei to atti ace the attention of their constituents , others lind them sehes unpleasantly tilked at, and even tlneatened.

It is a little bit discreditable that this stylo of warfare should be indulged in There was the loss e\cusf foi it m the cases mentionod, because the Houso sa-v that Mr. JAMES was ad>ocatmg Bpo
