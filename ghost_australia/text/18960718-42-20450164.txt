Croydon Is being well advertised in the old country, but there seems to be some fear lest the menagerie man—wild cat breeder—should do the field harm. The Croydon "Mining News" says :—"The Waratah., Gold Mines, Limited, i.e., the Waratah mine, 'is in a company of AQO,ooQ^_shares, pfJLQs,; eaeh»_:V£hich hj-ve^a market value in London of 18s. 3d;, per" share..

Le Neveu, he having been suc cessful: in an application in the War den's Court for the forfeiture of the ground^. Up to that time these were the only mines on the Waratah, yet we find that shares in a company with a capital of £5000 fully;paid-up, called the.

'■ " - The ■' Mining News" declares.:—" We have inquired from the representatives of the three Waratah mines, and they most emphatically state that they know i;otbing of this new Waratah company, and that the quotation does not refer to their mine. From these facts we con clude that the wildest cat of all is now before the public. This "new Waratah company holds no ground, on that line pf reef at any rate, nor is there- any re cord in the warden's office" of such a company ; being registered or holding ground oh. the Croydon goldfield.

In a recent number of. the "Windsor Magazine," Mr. Frankfort' gives a graphic description of some of his ex periences in the Transvaal, and his visit to a Boer farm. "The head of the household was a big, awkward, ill-look ing, old-man, almost as grim as Paul •Kruger himself. His big sons were slouching, whiskered men, and his wo menkind were equally forbidding. Their worst enemies, however, could not say that they were gaunt. We arrived about dinner time—that is to say, shortly after 11 in the morning. I Jhad heard of hos pitality being the sole virtue possessed by the Boers, and so I prepared for a hearty welcome. I waited in vain. The in terpreter said a few words of introduc tion, but a grunt was the only response that came from out host, and his women kind never so much as glanced up from the meat which they' were audibly de- * youring. .• We founcl^sea^ for ourselves at the-fpot: of the i^gu^hr-jKewn table, and in djae^'time^'i*ailieil : pyelidue time-we con sidered :tt^the'."l^ one of the men. was hacking-was "pushed down-to us along the table stained with the grease of twenty years of meals."'" •.Mr. .jFrankfort says/'^nothing- : can be ."more/ce'rfaih'.tli'an..that; that' hospitable-" boar^d* i>'a<J/.heyer^-'been.'- ; :yasHed- since "if ■ wassflrst;"saw'n. -,'.

The flesh was attributed to'a sheepj but hav ing 'tasted "sheep in more forms'than one • I'arri/prepared to say that-the'flesh we tasted couldlnpt.possibly .have'"come' off any.animal remotely resembling, a aheep. 'How-on earth.do they, manage to masti cate that ?' I inquired of oiir Interpreter.'. • They 'don't,' he replied ' laconically. 'Then how; on earth do they, escape dyspepsia ?' I asked. "They don't/ he replied again." -. ' . Here is an authentic story (says the " Pall- Mall Gazette") of the late Shah and the Prince of Wales. The Prince took Nasr-ed-Din, to Sandown Park races, and invited him to bet on a race. The Shah assented, and intimated that he expected that any horse that the Prince wished to win should win. At any rate, his Majesty explained that was the way matters were arranged in Persia. As the result of a bet the Shah received a £10 note, and he handed it to his favourite boy, Aziz, to play with. The boy tore it up, not knowing its value, but Colonel Roberts, of the police, had all the scraps picked up and pasted together, and the Prince of Wales now holds the mutilated note as a memento. .A jpluv that. went tec- far concluded in the District Court at Herberton last Vyeek (says the " Northern Miner' 1). It appears that three people in a store at Montalbion were discussing the Mount Luxton find, and Mr. S. Bennett said, "I would not give Mount Luxton for half-a-dozen Golden Treasures." A Mr. W. W. Champion said," Will you give me a commission to go out and buy Mount Luxton?" "All right," said Bennett..;, ; . .Champ.iqn ;: aske.dj! .."How much' 'will I go. ?"; 'Bennett replied, "-Ten hundred.":. '! W"on.Tyo.ti''riße.'it?'! Ghampion;: queried, {and: -Beniiett said, : ":Tes yoji can, gp to £120.8.? ; Champfon then..'asked.: •' What is the■ commission, like?" arid Bennett replied "2% per cent is a large commission." With that Bennett left the store, and shortly after was followed by Champion, who went out. some forty miles, bought the mine for :£l2OO, ; and paid £69 12s:'; deposit. Bennett, who treated the affair as a joke, was astounded to hear how Champion had acted, refused to go on. with-the sale; "and the deposit was forfeited. Champion then sued for the £69 12s. he . had paid as a deposit, £25.commission, : jand ;coach,v,fare,u In all £105. Judge Noei^sa!d/Tthe^wlioioi,affaltiiwas a. joke, but people should ;not: joke wlth>fo'ols, and gave a verdict: for £69 125?., and coach fare £1, each side to pay its.own ' costs. :.;•... .7 .-. ' ' ■ :..;■ •.. .The phenomenal heat which has been experienced in England during the last few days" will1 remind -our readers that •it was 'only a year or so ago that .one of the severest droughts known in ;the last half-century worked havoc, on. the crops and cattle of the old' country. Re ports"'of disaster and distress poured in. from' all Quarters and , siinstroke\ was * common.' Now it. looks as" though the weather were back to its tricks again. -Major Boyd's surmise that the seasons ■are changing will bear remembrance in this connection ; and, when we also recall the recent, severe frosts and snow in this continent, there seems good ground for believing that the world's relations to > Old Sol have~ been somewhat altered. Brisbane -has perhaps less' to complain , of-than any,.spot on the earth's,.surf ace '. in this respect.. The winter may.be.dryi as was last winter'; "but the New Tear saw us safely outside' the limit, of that awful -heat wave which drifted, down from Port Darwin, and phenomenal cold in the South was met. in this latitude by. nothing very. unseasonable. Hobart has a genuine live ghost of its own, and; last week the " Mercury" ■ says that " considerable excitement was caused in the Postal-Telegraph Depart ment by one of the staff rushing in and announcing that the supposed visitor . from -'another1 world had been captured at Sandy... Bay. A few minutes later one of the messengers appeared on the. scene and ..very excitedly gave the information as authentic, but the rumour.proved to:, be unfounded. The other eveningl a policeman on duty in Davey-street was somewhat startled by seeing what he took to be the ghost In St. David's burial ground, leaning against the fence. Be ing some distance away from the un . welcome visitor he stopped,' thinking o£ what he should do." Our contemporary says the constable "was alone, and naturally felt a bit nervous. However, he decided to * face the music/ and, drawing his staff, saun tered along, bracing himself up with the thought-that he was there to protect life and property. The flight was dark, and in the distance he could see the 'white monster/ with piercing eyes, staring fixedly at him. Still he went on, but wishing all the time that some one else was in his shoes. On getting pretty close to what he took to be the meet me-at-moonllght-alone visitor he asked him a question, but, getting no reply, he made a terrific hit with his staff, but the animal (for, sure enough, it'w'as a billy goat) dodged; 'and was soon 'but 6f reach. \- It lifldlbeen 'standing1 oh- a, tombstone,' with'!:ltSi two fore legs resting on the: fence1./: Th- policeman' .suffered 'a' good. deal fx'om;mingled' feelings after this, adventure; 'but wad''consoled with the proud *satisfaction--of having done - his' duty;"/"- ' ;- ( >. -.- '•:■■••'■ ■ • ':- ..

The officer became aware later of the job put up on him, and enjoyed the joke as much, as anyone. . ] A.South Australian lady, who resides in Menzies, in the course of a letter, . dated 9th June, to a friend-in Adelaide, • remarks:—" Meaizies is a little Cool gard'le to look at.

A'picked eleven of barristers from Lon don played a cricket match with a picked eleven of barristers from Man chester. The day was beautifully fine, and a large company had assembled to see which set of lawyers has had the more practice... With the first bill of the second over, however, a dispute' arose, and the twenty-two barristers gathered round the umpire to argue the , point. The argument continued with no • . sign of abatement till 6 in the evening, lit which time'the umpire died.. .
