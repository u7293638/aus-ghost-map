ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH, The Rev. D. A. Macdougall, minister elect of Malvern, preached at St. Andrew's Church yesterday morning and evening to large congregations. The text for the forenoon discourse was taken from Acts iv., 18-"They took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus." The preacher dwelt upon the wonderful change that had passed over the apostolic band through their companionship with Christ, and through His resurrection from the dead. The world nowadays should be able to mark in Christians as of old courage and zeal and willingness to deny them selves. In the evening the text was from Romans xiv., 17, 18-" The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteous. ness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." These were the three essentials of true religion, which must never be con founded with mere circumstantials. It was in following these that they pleased God, and really approved them selves to men of the world. Mr Mac dougall leaves shortly for a populous suburb of Melbourne.
