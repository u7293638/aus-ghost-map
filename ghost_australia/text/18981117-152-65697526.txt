AFTER LONG YEARS. " And have I bchanged " she asked, and as she poke:, The old emile on her pale face bravely broke, And on her eyes dead worlds of pathos woke. Changed When I kneo again the ghost of each Rememhered twitch .of gesture, manner, \- :speech, ' And.flt. the beauty that no years could reach. '" Tvill go back with on, writhouteregret. F?or not one word you spoke I d.re forget, And with each kiss of yours I tremble yet." "No,. you have taken your way, I took mine, * " A word may not our severed lives entwine. Nor .wrill a kiss the shortened yearse combine." She put her arms around me, held me near, Then'forward to her lonely path, and drear, She turned her sand, worn face, without a tear. ' ARTHUR S. ADAMS.
