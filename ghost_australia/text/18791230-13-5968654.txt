The follow ing aro tho lettors of our correspondents - HISTORY. OF THE rORTNIGIÎT LONDON, Nov 21 THE NEW TURKISH QUiSTlON The fortnight haa been more fruitful m rnmonrs than facts There havo been ru- mours of an impending dissolution but the posture of tho Government remains un- changed. There ha\ o been rumours of dis> sensiors among MiniatcrS, apparently with no other foundation than the frcquei ey with which they have mot in council Tliero havo been "umoars of a new d^arturo in tho Tostem question, of tho movement« of fleots, and the alarms of diplomatists, but, so far, ths chief and final incident has been-the appoint- ment of Baker Pasha to superintend tho introduction of tho long promised roforms mto Asia Never was tho Bpeech of a Pre mier anticipated with livehor interest than that of Lord Beaconsfield at the city banquet on Lord Major s Dav but it proved simply a surprise in its quiet reserve lhere wore no disclosures either m foreign or domestic policy , and so far it may bo taken to repre Bent tho general character of the last few weeks And yet tho changed tone of tho Government towards Turkey may have im portant reBults, and has already awakened tho interest of Europe I had occa- sion in my last lotter to note tho warn- ing words of Ministers in relation to tina subject Both Lord Salisbury and Mr Cross bad spoken of the rum that must over- take Turkey if she did not mend her ways A few days later it was announced that the rnghsh fleet had

enly tho excitement was rcncied, on tho statement last week that Admiral Hornby had received instructions to proceed east- ward in four days, a Btatcmont since denied, and explained to mean that ho had himself Mven tho order to ho ready but nf tem ords countermanded it ready, but af tem arda countermanded it 'lhere has been no lack of telegrams on the mntter, but wo aro left in much doubt as to what has actually taken place Incidents of this character sometimes portend great evon te, but the intentions of Ministers have not been explained Va havo no knowledge aa to what may bo the " so far and no further of their policy , whether their objoct has been a demonstration to compel clio coward heart of the Sultan fonction, or the initiation of a new course, which is virtually one of coercion, in tho direction bj winch only tho tottering empire can bo saved AU that ia certainly known ia that alTaira m Constantinople aro becoming desperate, that Sir Henry Lajard, after a tour in Sjrin, has mudo cnorgctic representations regarding tlio abuses every- where prev alont, and that our own Govern- ment insists with a now energy on the ex- ecution of tho reforms to which 'lurkoy has

The latter ib s iid to have supple mented Sir Henry Layard 8 remonstrances with representations of ita own in favour of reform On the other hand, tho Sultan ia alleged to have despatched a measen.er to Livudiu to invite the presence of the Russian fleet if the Engliah made its appearance m the Bosphorus It is plain thut, whatever the action of our own Govern ment within the limits of the Asiatic Cou vention, any movement which affecta Con atantmople at once revives a European ques tion Any attempt to coerce would be simply a return to the position of afiaira at the time of the ConBtantinople Congress, and an indi cation that England had espouse 1 a policy which she then rejected It is further stated that Russia had advised Turkey to ask all the signatory powers to the Treaty of 18jG to dcBpatch squadrons to tho Dardanelles in case the Straits were eiuered by the l*ut,hsli fleet. Another account reporta that the Austrian Government, in reply to an apphci tion from the Porte answered that when ever the Ruasian fleet appeared in tho Baltic the Austrian fleet would also bo " on the side of the powers desiring peace LORD BEACONSFIELD ON THE SUUAIION Any new development of policy m tho East would excite the liveliest interest at home Theserecentnegotiations havebeen anxiously watched. On the surface of affairs, tho action of the Government haa appeared hko areply to the taunts of itscntics so frequently repeated of late, as to the " dead letter character of its Asiatic engagements At the same time, it is Been that any such action as could only be sustained by the intervention of the fleet involves momentous ruks and responsibilities And greatly aa Englishmen of all parties would rejoice in any policy which could effectually redeem Asia Minor from its present condition, the apprehension is general lest wo ahould embark on a task which is beyond the scope of even our " na penal" power The silence of Lord Beaconsfield at such a juncture wasdieappointing to the expectations which had been raised, but not unlike him Earlier in the day the Lord Majora show, according to annual wont, had wound its way through the crowded streets with all its customary civic Bplendours, and its batches of knights in armour, in quaint contrast with the soldiers who had places m the pro cession Hie multitudes seemed larger than ever, and while they greeted the new chief magistrate with applause, they gave a piquancy to the proceedings by an accom pamment of hissea, which followed tho re tiring lord mayor, who haa mado him Self unpopular almoat throughout the . route The interest of theae lively scenes was, however, surpassed by that which attached to the evening banquet in the ancient Guildhall Lord Beaconsfield waa received with cheers when he roae to reply to tho toast of the Ministry The firat point to which he addressed himself waa the revival of trade, on which he Bpoke in con jrratulatory and reassuring terms He gave it as the opinion of the Government that that revival is of a ' permanent character,' and quoted various facts in evidence amongBt them tho great activity m " the manufacture of chemicals, a remark which has provoked some caustic criticism More satisfactory than the revival of tiade had been the admirable conduct of tho people "during these years of terrible trial ' " Die Btram on their resources, Bind the Premier ' lins j erhapa never been equalled, and yet llicro has never been a mur mur-not of discontent (Cheers ) The voice of

often accompanied by somewhat irregular logic (A laugh ) But I confess I cannot bring myself to comprehend how the Irish people have brought themselves to believe that the best way to encounter econo mical distress is political agitation und social confusion (Loud cheers ) There ia no doubt that there are portions of Ireland where it may be neccaaary that some means Bhould be applied to avert considerable Buffering, and the subject has duly received the attention of Her Majesty a Government But I think Ireland ought to remember that in her distress sho has never appealed to m her distress she has never appealed to the Bympatby of England in vam, and that sympathy has generally assumed a very substantial embodiment (Loud cheers ) It will be the duty of Her Majesty s Govern ment to watch with the anxiety which the situation requires the state of those portions of Ireland, but I would venture to hope that the Irish people, convinced on reflection that the sympathy of longland is a sentiment which is never Bcantily Bupphedto them will even condescend to recollect that if they hav e had a bad harvest that harvest is much better than that of England (Cheers ) Re terring next to

Ap Íiroaching Europe, his words were listened or still more eagerly " With regard to our external affairs generally, said Lord Beacons field, "although Europe ib covered with armed millions of men we still hope, and I will venture to say, believe, that peace will bo maintained (Cheers ) We are of that opinion because it seems to us that peace n the interest of all the Great Powerd I woul 1 not myself place it on so low a consideration as the neceBBity we all have of husbanding our resources, because I know that the Powers of Europe are influenced by motives of a much higher character, but

(CheerB ) It is one from which Her Majesty's advisers do not shrink (Cheers ) In conclusion, Lord Beaconsfield, borely touched the theme on which chiefly it had been expected i.'e would mako some

evening, the Duke of Argyll was the principal speaker, but the crowd was so large that he could not make himself heard, and spoke in a confusion vv hich compelled him to address himself to a very small circle He reviewed the foreign, and especially the Indian, policy of the Go vernment with great seventy Referring to our ABiatic relations with Russia, he said - ' Look at the lesson that is taught us on the failure of the Russian expe dition by the calamity that has happened to tho Russian army advancing from the Caspian Lord Salisbury at Man chester Baid, ' A dreadful thing has happened The Russians have a new basis on the Caspian That basis ia about8o0 miles from i he nearest point of Afghanistan, and the Russians m attempting to advance a ¿is tance of not moro than 200 miles

Since the announcement m a Router's mes- sage from Melbourne of the 2nd inst that a dissolution waB expected, some further in- terest has been evinced by tho English press in your legislativo quarrel The Globe, which has dealt rather ten- derly with Mr Berry in his attacks upon the Council, has spoken plainly on his present reform meisure, and regards in particular the plebiscite clause as so uu Eiiglieh and so unstatesmanliko that it hopes and believes Mr Berry will not insist upon retaining it If he does, tho Globe remarks that he must expect no support or sympathy from any section of public opinion in this country The Pall Mall has nothing what- ever to say m favour of Mr Berry's doings The Morning Post thinks tho only portion of the reform sch"me entitled to be favourably viewed ib that for substituting a nominee for an elective Upper House, and perhaps this is due to the impression that the Victorian Constitution would then moro closely resemble that of the mother country The Tonis of yesterday had a very forcible article on the question, showed that reason able proposals for a compromise had been offered quite recently, and plainly hinted that if theBe were not accepted, and Mr Berry pushed matters so far as to again apply for the intervention of the Home Government your extreme democrats might find them BelveB somewhat disappointed at seeing the Victorian

grams aro occasionally transmitted, with out duo inquiry or the exercise of judgment Tho first telegram, dated London, the 10th September, had reference to the long talked of visit of tho Prince of W ales to Australia, and the second, which purportB to hav e been despatched from Lon don on the following day, stated that the Im penal Government contemplated adopting measures with a view to restricting the hor rowing powers of the various colonic3 How such a ícport came to be telegraphed it might be difficult to say, but utterly improbable as it is, on the face of it, that the Imperial Government would meditate interfering with tlie constitutional rights of the colonies in the manner indicated, it can now bo asserted, on authority, that the statement was completely devoid of foundation The same, too, may be Bald of the other telegram I refer to regarding the Prince of W ales As published in one of your contemporaries on the 13th September it alleged that His Royal HighneBS the Prince of W ales was making the necessary arrange nieiits for his visit to Australia, and, as usual in the ev ent of a lengthened absence of the heir to the throne from England, mea- sures were being takon to provide for such a T, + Mfrmii-v na tin» ilpath nf Her Mfiipstv contingency as* the death of Her Majesty ti o Queen before the Prince's return home At the date when these telegrama were despatched from England the membera of the Cabinet wero scattered in all directiona, and it may safelj be affirmed that nothing waa further from their thoughts at the time than rouBing the iro of the colonies by at- tempting to limit their powers of contracting loans, or providing specially for tho possible contingency at somo future date of tho decease of Her Majestj Writing from Lon- don on 21th August, a fortnight before the appearance of theso telegrama in your con- temporary, Iliad pointed out the fact thal owing to the late pmod that the request for the Prince and the Rojal Commission to accept transfer of the charge of the British Court in the Melbourne Exhibition had been mado no action could then be taken, in conse- quence of the dispersion of statesmen and others, who would have to decide upon tho matter, and the observations wero wound up by the remark that in "well informed circles' there was a growing belief that the undertaking would be honoured by the presence of tne Prince, if not tho Prin- cess, of V» alea, though not at the open- ing Such undoubtedly was the prevalent opinion then '1 he Prince had expresaed Ina desire to bo manj, both

matters gone so far a3 to warrant the statement that nis Royal HighncBS was making arrangements for the visit, and the provisions for the contingency of the death of the Queen during Ina absence

chance of his being able to gratify his wiahes There aro three serious drawbacks to the ful- filment of his desire ThefirBt is the Prince's personal unwillingness, in the present 3tate of tlio finances, to put the country to the ex- pense that w ould havo tobe incurred on the occasion of a visit made in Bemi-regal atate, and winch would certainly not bo less than was entailed by his Indian expedition; secondly, tho undesirabihty of his being ab- sent from England at the time of tho next general election, which there floema now every probability will take placo about the close of next year, which would otherwise have been the moat convenient time for the Prince to absent himself for a lengthened period from England. Thirdly, the Prince apparently has been made aware of the strength of colonial susceptibilities and intercolonial jcalousj, and would be most unwilling to arouso any auch feeling, and he and h s frienda fear that if, other objections being got rid of, ne were to visit the Melbourne Exhi- bition, the people of New South Walea would feel aggrieved that ho had not honourel their display with his preaence. Those aro the main obstacles to the Prince going oat to Australia There are others, but my in formant Btates that the three 1 havo cnumc rated are those which havo tho greatest weight. MISCELLANEOUS The great failure of the Trench vintage has had the effect of directing attention to colonial wines, and numerous communica tiona have appeared in the papers advocating their claims to public favour, and pointing out how appropriate would bo tho present moment for an alteration of tho tariff bo as to admit them at tho lowest scale of duty Ono writer, Dr Arcedeckne Duncan, physi- cian to tho National Hospital for diseases of the heart and paralysis, made special reference to the auldana wine from South Australia, and Bta'ed that he had ordered it largely amongst his patients, all of whom considered it an admirable and pleasant substitute for sherry ai d other wines of that class He remarks that, tho climate of Australia being bo favourable for the growth of the vine, the wine ho speakB of does not require to be fortified, nor is it subject to the admixture of the colouring matters so deleterious but eo common to the cheap wines of Europe The Ï imcs correspondent at Pans, referring to the v mtage m Prance, says that in tho Gironde the quantity will not be the fourth that of an ordinary year and the quality will bo very poor, whilst in Champagne "a disaster has occrrrcd unparalleled for 00 years Not a bottlo of wine has been harvested The grape did not ripen, and it has been gathered only in order to prevent trespassers from entering the vine yards and damaging them ' 'I he India iluBeum is, after all, not to bo broken up altogether At a meeting of the India Council, on the 12th inst, it was de cided that the museum Bhould be reopened in the course of six or seven months, with additions which will present to the people of this country such an exhibition of the manu- facturing and artistic resources of India as haB never before been laid open to their view The Home Government will in future defray the whole expense of the museum, no portion of the cost being allotted to India The plants and their immediate economic pro- ducts are to go to Kew, the animals and tculptures to the British Museum, whilst here will be sent to South Kensington the collections illustrating art atid ethnography The museum will mainly consist of speci mens illustrative of Indian architecture and the sumptuary arts The Standard, referring to the disposition of the contents of the museum, says that it can only meet with the qualified satisfaction of those who had hoped that the noble collection bequeathed to the nation by the East India Company would havo been allowed to remain intact A telegram from Pans, dated the 12th mat, announced that an agreement had been made between Lord John Manners, Post- master General, and M Cochery, MiniBter of Posts and 'I clegrapliB, whereby, on and after the let 1 ebruary next, all the Indian mails will be carried over the Tronch route, be- tween Pans and Modano and vice versa A telegram a day or two previous from Wash- ington, stated that the Assistant Postmaster General reported that Great Britain had already paid to the United States 250,000 Hnllnrn for rnnvpvincr tho British Aus dollara for conveying the British Aus- tralian maila across the American con- tinent, in reference to which a traveller, writing to tho Pall Hall, asks what is the benefit derived from thia expen- diture by the English people, to whicn he sajs the reply is that not only do they derive no benefit at all, but they actually play into the hands of their trading rivals, the Americans, by opening up to them additional markctB in Australia and New Zealand by means of direct steam communication be tw een those colonies and San Francisco The same writer sajs that, as regards postal com- munication between Englandand hersouthern coloniea, a fortnightly service via Suez would have been ample for business purposes, besides keeping the trade as much os pos Biblo in the hands of our own people Apropos of postage to India ard China, a Mr J Mooyer haa called attention in Tlw Times to the fact that Germany, aa a mem- ber of the postal union, only charges 2Jd for letterB to India, China, and Japan, although they are forwarded by the Peninsular and Oriental Companj, whilst letters from Eng- land are charged upwards of double the amount Mr Mooyer rightly remarks that it seems hardly credible that Germany should hav e been able to gain such advantages for her own subjects, as tho correspondence from that country to the East cannot bo 1 per cent of that from Great Britain. Trench journals Btate that it ia contem- plated to separate the Ministry of Colonies from the MiniBtry of Marine, and to consti- tute a special Colonial Ministry Speaking at Hereford, on tho 12th mat, Colonel Arbuthnot, M P , said the next ques- tion of the day would be the consolidation of the Empire They had immense colonial possessions, and in a few years their trado must equal that of any other country If the Government were wise they would take steps without delay to bring about an alliance with the colonists to induce them to give J ngland trado adv antages they would not give to foreign nations 1 he new trial m tho Bagot will coso has been fixed for the 1st December, but it ia not likely to come on for Bomo short time after- wards Sinco the last trial Mrs Bagot has been married to a Mr Reginald Wynne Roberts The Neto York Times, referring to immi- gration, says that the number of immigrants arm ing this j ear at New York is estimated to reach over 150,000 In 1877 there were only fil,536, and laat year about 20,000 more The paper remarks that the im miivrnnta nrnvtntr at Castle Garden re* migrants arriving at Castle Garden re- present a class much higher in tho social scale than those of former years, and they are possessed of some capital. An in- stance ib given of 20 Russian families who brought with them capital amounting to 85,000dol The returns of emigration from Liverpool during October snow a re- markable increase upon recent years 15,002 emigrants left the Mersey, or nearly double the number of October, 1878, and of these 11,729 went to the United States.
