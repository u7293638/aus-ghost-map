REGENT P U B L I O A T I O N S . "The Laurel Walk," by Mrs Molesworth, published. in Grant Richard's Colonial Library, is a realistic story of family lifo, with hut one supernatural agency of a ghost woven into the talo to lift it out of commonplace. In ono respoct the authoress has, so far as diversity of character 'is concerned, followed upon the lines of Jane Austin in "Pride and Prejudice!" Moving in the same placo each character in manner and conversation differs from its nearest associate. A fothor soured in expectation of an inheritance is moroso in genernl, and hut admits himself to be affable and courteous on a special occasion. His wife maintains her prido and coremouial otiquette under impoverished circum stances. Their daughters fret in lonolincss for want of amusement nnd socioty. A wealthy family comes to resido in tlio vicinity, visits follow, bachelors do their duty in making love to the girls, jealousies are aroused and antagonisms on the part of parents, followed by the happy ending of marringes. Except the gin st that haunts tlio ' Lam-el Walk' for not. having signed tho will she inu-uded to do boforo her spirit should have gone to another sphere, thoro is nothing disturbing in the story, which can ho read without the shedding of tears or lapsing into laughter. There nro, however, in it several passages of delicate treatment, such as occur where tho wise tactical daughlor of the family thinks slio is beloved, hut is chagrined to find slio is but. used ns a medium to conciliate hut parents to tiie suit of the lover to her sistor. "Tho Mess Doolt," by VY. F. Shannon, -pub lished in Metlmon's Colonial Library, is a rough story of sou lifo abounding iu uauticul slang which is inure acceptable in one chapter than iu a cuntiiiuiitinn over a volume. There are many adventures recorded in tho cruising of the navy ship and in tliu conduct of tho liuo-jacknts. fleth tlio ahove works are from Messrs Geo. Robertson and Co , from whom tlioy can ho oh- tained.
