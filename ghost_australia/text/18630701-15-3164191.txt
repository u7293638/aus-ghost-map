Yesterday the new river pilot bout for lite Fitz- roy, lett Brisbane for tho scene nf her future em- ployment, in charge of Mr. Henry late a boat- swain on board the Clarence. This little vessel ii about 35 feet lung and about 7 feet beam, with ii draught of 3 feot C inches ol' water. She has ample accommodation on board for six men. Sho is rigged as a furn and aft schooner, with square-headed gnll' toiwails, and when sailing on Monday lust, lier performances were considered very satisfactory by Lieutenant Heath, the harbor muster.. From ber small siz.s she can easily he rowed al the rale of three miles an hour, by throe men with sweeps. The wliule nf the rigging waa made under Lieut*-' nant Heath's supervision, hud'the sails were linnie ky the crew ol' bis own bunt. - The blocks and all the ironwork used in lier fittings were linnie bv tradesman inDrisb.ino.: On previous occasions we luive staled her linnie, iii error, ns lin* Yarro, we ure now informed thnt It should be the Km. The Yarra Tarni,-steamer, will leave at 730 a.m. this day for Sydney. Tho stern-wheel steamer, Gnering, cleared at the Customs yesterday for .Mooloolah, in ballast. She will take six passengers. Tie Setller, slonmei-, relumed from Hie bay yesterday, ami came alongside Hull's wharf ut about 7 p.m. The trip was considered very .satis- factory, by coini-etent judges, and we tuny men- tion, that she crossed the river bur Inst evening ni dead low, water, though she lind about 150 tons nf cargo on board. She will again proceed to the bay at noon to-day. At sundown, last night, there were no vessels in sight at the bur. Captain J. B. Bennet, of the Hamlet's Ghost; reports the following whalers:-The Bonnie Doon, Captain Wybrow, was at the Chesterfield Group, in a leaky condition, the lower chain plate bolts having started. She was making so much water and had encountered such bad weather that Captain Wybrow put into those islands for shelter, and intends to fish on that station during the remainder of the season. He had 45 barrels of oil on board. On the 19th June Captain Bennett parted company with the barque Offly, of Hobart Town, Robinson, master, six weeks ont, and all well. On that date also he boarded the Victoria, of Hobart Town, Ormstalk, master, about 50 miles to the E.S.E. of Cato's Bank. She was six weeks out, and was " clean," that is, had no oil on board. The Victoria had spoken the Eury, and Caernorvan, both clean, and the Amherst, Lee, muster, with 45 barrels oil. The steamer Hotham went down to the bay yesterday with a supply of fresh provisions for the Hannah More. The Hotham left, the ship's side about 5 p m., and just previous to her casiing-ofi', Dr. James Robb, the surgeon superintendent reported that there lind been no fresh cases of hooping cough. A child died on Sunday last, and was buried on Moreton Island, and another died on Monday night, and was interred on Mud Island. Both deaths resulted from hooping cough. One child on board was very ill of inflammation of the brain, supervening after hooping cough. Dr. Lobb is of the opinion that the sooner the children suffering from hooping cough are separated from those not so effected the less ehance there will be of the sickness extending. The Hotham passed the Cyclone working up the river near Egg Island last night. The schooner Prince of Denmark was wrecked on the Bampton Reefs during a very heavy gale on the 19th of March last, the same gale it will he remembered in which the Everton was stranded. The wreck was caused by the chains parting, when the schooner ran ashore on one of the islands of' the Chesterfield group, at which place Captain Bennett had a whaling station. While on this island he constructed a large boat out of portions of tbe wreck and some cedar boat plank, which was among his stores on the island. This craft he rigged as a schooner, and named thc Hamlet's Ghost, and in it he embarked, with ten men, for Sydney; but encountering foul winds off Smoky Cape, he put back to Brisbane. His crew are all natives of the South Sea Islands, and, we believe, arrangements have been made for the greater number of them to proceed to Sydney by the steamer to-day. Captain Bennett will remain in Brisbane, it being his intention to sell the Ham- let's Ghost if he can find a purchaser here. STEAMER FOR IPSWICH.-The Ipswich will leave the A. S. N. Company's wharf this day at 8-30 a.m.
