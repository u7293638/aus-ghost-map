TOO MMUCH. Sprightleigh: "Hello, old man, what are you moping here for? Why aren't you danc Ing?" Fauxpas: "To avoid entanglements." Sprightleigh: "I didn't know you were so desirable." Fauxpas: "Huh! I'm not. Fact is, first dance I had I caught my foot in my partner's dress and ripped a mile or two of trimming off it; next time, some awkward fool tripped me, and we both went down on our hands and knees opposite each other, as though we were barking at each other; and the last I caught my cuff button in Miss Fluffy's hair, and it took me an hour to get loose. Next time I dance, it'll be a ghost dance."
