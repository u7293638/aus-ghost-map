Why, women look for ward with joyful eagerness to the spring house- oleaning, and when the time at last comes round they display the despot that is in them relentlessly, and the worse they look during the pendeney of the fit and the more miserable they make the homs and its lord and master the better they are pleased.

Mr. Barker is mute as a fish in the sea; Mr. Miles never goes on a journey*; Mr. Gotobed sits up to half after three; Mr Makepeace was bred an attorney, Mr. Gardener can't tell a flower from a root; Mr. Wild is as tame as a hack; Mr. Rider performs all his journeys on.foot, Mr. Foote on a roan horso's back. Mr. Hayseed: ' Marior, I've made up my isind ter send our boy to the city writing school to learn how to write.' Mrs. Hay seed : ' He writes a good hand.' ' Yes, Marior, but ho's too slow for these times. The city's the place to learn things, Marier, no matter what. They write like greased lightnin' there. Why, Marier, while I was in the city I saw a man write a two-page love letter in seventeen seednds by the watch. Ho was a regular city feller, too-I could tell by his clothes. Why, Marier, when the girl that letter was writ to got it, it took her 'most five minutes to read it. I timed her, too.' ' Lova letter-girl reading it !
