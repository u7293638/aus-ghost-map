The second judgment states explicitlythat after the estab- lishment of an independent Legislature there was no power in the Crown by viitue of its prerogative to establish a Metropolitan see or province, or to create an ecclisiasticul corporation '. whuse status rights and authority the colony could be required to recognise " I beg particular attention t> these last words, "who=e status rights, and authority tho colony could bo required to recognise," becmse it is not denieJ thit ths Crown could by its nrerogativo establish a Metrop ilttan see or province, but tho denial is to this effect, it cannot establish one with co TCIVO juiLdiccion. And so further ; when Lord TVestbury's judgment affirms that the Crown has no power to assign to a bishop a diocese, or give him a sphere ot action within tho United Kingdom, tho Crown can enly do this by statute, as in the case3 of Manchesier and Ripon, the same is true in the colonies; bec inse after a colony has received legislative institutions, the Ctown stands in the same relation t > that colony as it doei to the United Kingdom. Thecjniment of the Ma?ter of the Rolls upon the passage in Lord West- bury's judgment is very important, and is as follow«: '.It is not intended to state that the Crown is unable to appoint a person a bishop, and direct him to exercise his functions in a eoluny . . . within certain defined limits. . . . Nor is it intended to state that the terri- tory, the limits of which are an defined, would not consti- tute a see or dioceso properly so-called, but it is thereby intended to stats that tha Crown has no power to constitute a seo or diocese analogous to a see or dfoce.-e within the limits of the United Kingdom of England and Ireland, in- venting the bishop with coercive jurisdiction." He further adds that "it is not tb.3 coercive jurisdiction which con- stitutes the see or diocese." AVhat then I'B it that in the oases under consideration con- stitutes a see or diocoso ? The action of the Crown, based upon tho supromicy; f s will of the Crown being signified by tho letters j.:.ieut. It is no answer to this to say that the lo'ters puttnt aie vvoithless. because they have purported to convey certain powers which they cannot con- vey. The letters p*tsnt, accordmir to the third judgment, may be gen»rally valid, and yet be ineffectual to confer any privilege which is not inherent in the office of a biship; they may make him líürallx' a bishop, and confer upon him c itim poweri winch ho may lojally oxercise and yet at I the s uno timu put| ort to frivo h ni otbei pow rs which bo cannot li ¿illv ovei is But Iho ciuutiistiinto tint suth excess ot p ivy01 is ixttoni) ted to bo conforrod in nn 1 by thi letters patent d"cs not nnder them wholly invalid, or vitiato that portion of thom which oon foi s powers which niav bo legally eX( re sed | In a rouesponilenco b«tyvcon tyvo of my fr ends npin th s subieit thi f llowing pa -.icos 0 cm I |ln¿ ihnt tho Mister ol tho Rills munt uns tint th» letters piitmt uro notwastopap i tbntthev no valid foi ih purj oso uf, in a sins , appointing 01 mak ne n pors n to b a bishop, with dne witkm certain defined limits and this is co, a though tho lotters ratont aro lnoflectual to confer on tho Bi«hop jurisdiction, that is tho p ivy er of onfoioing poismully, and ns a court, tho execution of ordiis given by linn m tho'dm exoia«o of tho authority nttichod to his Ktatus as a Bishop I find too, that the Master of the Bolls loconcilos this view with tho Pnvy Council iugd meutinLongv Bishop ot Capo Town and shows that it is ccnsistont w ith holding that the Crow n cannot create in a cob ny a bishop and a diocoEO, like to a B -hop and a diocoaom England ' Tho correspondent o then procerds thus, and I driw particular attention to tho aigumont, " If tho lotters patont cm appoint a person as Bishop and xalidlv limit thooxerciso of his functions as to locality, thoy may, with equal validity, also limit ths cxerciso of his functions in tho way of subordination In the uno ca«o it IB not nocessary that a lojal diocese should exist, so in tho othor it ia not nocessarv that a legal province should exist Tho cc le-iastical act of consecration confois up n tho poi- son consociated thocbaruter of Bishop, with nil pow oro and authorities incidental to tho oftioo, nnd to the status thus created tho letters patent uttn h themselves But thou lot it bo further observed that, at consociation, tho Bi Imp,by thooilhofobedutic ,occlc huu=alf to anothtr Bish », and I thoroforo concludo that the letters i ahnt may as v ilidlv act upon und give cflcot to tins rclati n of suuordinition, as they act nun and gixo ilfect to the goneial uosition if Bishop in other w oui», nui oint one peí on a Metroi olttan and nnothei a Suffracan Bishoo " In tho judgments delivered bv Lords Westbury and Bonully there is nothinir whatever to bo found m opposi- tion to this MOW of tho cffoitof 1 tleispateut on the» con- ti arv, tho formel iinkestlio supposition that the ooclosns tical lelation of metí imbtan md sutîrajran umv have bten croiitcd by letteis patent HIB languaio is 13 follows - "Let it bo granted irui-suncd that tie lettoi-. patonl aro suthcitnt in law to c uhr on L)r.
