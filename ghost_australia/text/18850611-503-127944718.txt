A Men on her Eggs. An 1 ah ! thiB time I've got, I think, just five. White as the moon upon an August night. I long to see the contents well alive, For those chicks, still unborn, are my delight. My eldest egg — now let me pause andjEee ; He'll be a valiant rooster-bird, of courso, Having the graco of the ailantus tree, A linnet's voice, the brute strength of ahorse. My second, I must very fondly dream, Will be a poule de lettres, and very wise ; She in linguistics will be held supreme, And she will learn the idiom oi the flies. That third, delicious, speckled egg of mine Will bring me forth the handsomest of males, With military genius, I opine — A fowl tho foe of garden slugs and snails. That other there— that dotted littlo dear — Will cause my poor maternal mind regret ; For she will be, I positively fear, Tho wayward Cleopatra of my set. But, ah I the one that has a beauty mark Bight on the top, from Duty no'er will quail ; She, Christian-like, will suffer in the dark And be the chickens' Florence Nightingale. So saying, the hen clucked loudly in her joy, And waved her wings upon the unhatohed eggs ; But then appeared a stalwart poultry-boy, With squinting eyes and odious crooked legs I He seized hor offspring right before her eyes, Took the three best, the ones she prized the most. And, to the mother's infinite surprise, Vanished around the corner like a ghost I And, while she hurried after him to say, ' Spare, spare my children, and be ever blest I' A weasel, who had Been no food that day. Happened to tramp along, and suck the rest. — Cupid Jones.
