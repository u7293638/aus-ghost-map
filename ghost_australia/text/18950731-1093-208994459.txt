SPOUTISG. COURSING AT KAPUNDA. THE ANLABY STAKE. Kapunda, July 30. The Kapunda Coursing Club's annual meeting commenced - to-day on the Anlaby Estate, the property of Mr. H. Dutfcon. There was a good assemblage of greyhound owners present when the card was called- on Thursday night, but very little business was done, the. owners of one or two of the best dogs having backed them privately. During the night a couple of showers fell, and the running-ground is likely to be moist, but hares are said to be plentiful, and the secretary and committee are sanguine of getting the card run through by "Wednesday afternoon. The meet on the opening day was at'Clayton's, and on the second day the opening proceedings will be at the Woolsheds. The club, had excellent sport to-day, the weather proving beautifully tine with a clear sun and a fresh breeze prevailing. There was a good, attendance of spectators, including ' a number of • ladies, and everything passed , off most satisfactorily. _Mr.. M. H. ■ Combe, the honorary judge, acquitted himself_ admirably, riding well to his_ dogs, and his decisions were beyond question, except in one course, Pirriniimma against Jacka's Beer, in .which the former was scoring most on the hillside, in view of the spectators, but Mr. Combe's horse could pot get up, and clumps of trees prevented Mm seeing the work.. He called the stewards together, and announced that he must give'it undecided. Somemembers who were riding good horses were'blameable in not lending them to the judge for an occasional course, seeing that the country was hilly and some ; of the courses were very long. Large numbers of hares escaped through the tussocky country, but besides several no-goes, 19 courses were completed—a good day's record in the far paddocks—leaving easier work for the finishing runs in better country on the homestead paddocks on Wednesday. The ; crowd was very _ orderly, and the management reflected credit on the secretary and field officials. The slipper also accom plished his task creditably. \- The officials were-Patron, Mr. H. Dutton; president, Mr. D. James. vice- presidents Sir Jenkin Coles, Messrs. P. M. Miller, .!". W. White, R. Barr Smith, J. 1ST. Smith, D. H. Shannon, W. Oats, A. J. Poster, W. Thomas, A. Thomson, H.

Considerable interest attaches - to the first .course in the .morning, when the Waterloo Cup and Manoora winners, Good Hope and "British Lion, meet together in the slips • at 9 o'clock in the homestead paddock. The1 latter, is the favorite to win the stake, fours-to one only being on offer. Several other clinking good dogs are left in, and the ' finals may develop surprises. The indications are favorable for another fine day and a larger attendance than on Tuesday.
