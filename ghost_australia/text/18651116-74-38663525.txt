CONFIRMATION AT ST. PAUL'S. On Tucaday the Bishop of Tasmania ad. ministered the rite of confirmation at St. Paul's Churoh, Launceston. The church being small, there were more persons than available space, though by an eflort of the wardens of the church most of the parishioners were supplied with seats. The church was decorated in some parts in a suggestive and tastoful manner. Several appropriate mottos woro written up on the walls in various parts of the building. At the further end, on either side of the windows, were the wvords "Then laid they their hands on them. and they re ceived the Holy Ghost," woven in ivy loaves. The inscription, " This is the house of God this is the gate of heaven," in golden letters and red cloth, decorated the southern end of the church. The font was surrounded by a splendid spelimen of embroidery work in scarlet, with yellow fringe, the whole sur. mounted with a tine bouquet of emblematical flowers. At cloven o'clock. as soon as the bohell stopped, the choir began to sing the Pro cession Hymn.

A. Darkway (pastor of St. Paul's) leading, followed by the R1ev. Messrs. Mason, Hales, and Ffookes, the rear being brought up by the Bishop. In this order the procession reached the head of the charoh. After the appointed service had been gone through, the Bishop ad. dressed the candidates in a very foreiLlo manner relative to the responsibilities they were taking upon themselves. He then "laid hands" on some 55 young- persons, 44 of whom were from the congregation of. St. Paul's and the remainder from the Trinity pnrish.
