It Rains. It rains, and it rains, and the hours drag past And you are gone; And I know that the bar has swung down at last, And I, alone, Alone by the chill of the desolate hearthi Alone in the gloom of the wet-swept earth ; Alone, mid the ghosts of our sweet past hours, Our hopes and dreams and their vanishing dowers, Sit, staring sadly and vacantly, At the low grey earth, and the low g'eysky; While the wailing winds lash the streaming panes, And it rains, it rains. It rains, and it rains; and before me swim, Just two blue tear-fraught eyes, And I look till I feel muy own grow dim, And a voice within me cries : Is it all to be thie-no more than this :To remember close clasp and lingering kiss ; To remember sweet words and sheltering arm ; And moments so p~asionste, rich, and warm, That just to remember, the numbed heart wakes, And for all that it loses yearns and aches, K As life against circumstance chafes and strains, And it rains, it rains. It rains, and it rains, and I think,.beloved, Now you are gone ; Now Time his pitiless strength has proved, And I alone, Am left mid the ruins of happiness, To take up life and work-just less Of strength and courage and hope and peace, It is almost time for it all to cease ; Was it better before we knew whet it meant? When all that we sought was just content 7 I don't know, darling. Iknow it pains. And it rains, it rains.
