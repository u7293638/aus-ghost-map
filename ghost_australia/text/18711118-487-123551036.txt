AH'sorts of appointments aro in'* like rasnner Barmecidal ; and often when the world con gratulates a man on .his .good luck, and ns^umes that his fortunois mhda off hnnd. thn truth is that tho whole thing is a sham and a pretence, thatthcro is no. good luck-in the matter,1 but, on the contrary, bad '; seeing that this dead body of a thing,, this Barmecidal ghost, stops tho way against somothing bettor and more sincere. . ... .The', house' wo rent and the hbrso \vb buy, tho' lover wo marry and tho friend wo choose, tho post wo accopt and the sect wo join, all tho affairs of life, -, social,1 spiritual, emotional, practical, we find to bo in their turn Barmecidal, disappointing, and untrue. There is nothing that has not at times a promise unfulfilled, n show and no reality. Perhaps one of the most mournful of tho many sor rows of life is tho1 phantasmagoric character which pervades it— this uncertain and unreal appearance which fades away who^ you: soek to grasp it, and turns into nothing in your hand. Love itself is a mere rosy cloud that has no' objective quality. It is only as you yourself make it that it exists at all ; and when your mind has changed the love has fled and all for .which ypu loved .fled too. You may conceal your chagrin bravely, sit at tho unfurnished table and make-believe that you aro enjoying a sumptuous ropast, but tho hoart which knows its own bitterness tells you how hollow your seeming satisfaction is, and even j'our host who is watching you, while pretend ing to press- on you good things that do not exist, oven he or sho laughs at you secretly for tho disappointment you aro feeling though not betraying.' Yet, after all, what is true 1 ,'rhd queetioh was asked . more than 'eighteen' hundred years ago,' and! tho. man who could satisfactorily answer it ..has not yet arisen. Still the, Barmecide feasts of human , life go on, and1 guests come crowding to empty tables where thoy had, fimdly hoped to have bepn fed and nourished ; still pretences^., niake .beiieves, false prpmis,os rule the world as'of old ; but. how we aro to close up- tho fatal:sluices, how fill tho blank dishes of the Barmecide hosts abounding, is a problem, to which no' answer has been, given so. far as we havo gone yet. And to which wo fear ono will conjio .only with th'tfirilllenhiutn.'1 ; ' ;
