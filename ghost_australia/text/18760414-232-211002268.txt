HAVE YOU SEEN THE GHOST A considerable sensation (says the Geelong Adver- tiser) prevails in the neighborhood of Macarthur. owing to the nocturnal presence of an apparition which has been seen by several persons on the estate of Mr Carmichael. at Harton Hills. It appears that four men, working at a job of fencing, were camped about two miles from the Lead station, when they were alarmed some three or four nights ago by seeing a figure, draped in white, stalking backwards and for wards in the moonlight. So frightened were they that they beat a retreat to the station, and communi cated the particulars to Mr Towart, the overseer, whilst a dog they had with them participated in alarm, and ran away howling piteously. Next night a party of eight, including a policeman from the township, bivouacked in the haunted spot, and five of them were rewarded by getting a sight of the ghost, The news began to spread, and we understand on Wednesday night a large party was to be made up from Mac Arthur, with a view to solve the mystery, if possible. Tradition states that the locality in ques- tion was, many years ago, the scene of a fatal affray between the early settlers and the aboriginals, and that in these encounters the blacks came off second best. Of course the supposition is that one of the natives so disposed of has a jumped up whitefellow. in fulfilment of the aboriginal belief, and hence the astonishment of the nerves of the fencing party by his "counterfeit presentment" It should be men tioned that the ghost has already one casualty to answer for. inasmuch as one of the intended inter- viewis, in his hurry to get a sight of the apparition, was thrown from his horse and broke his leg.
