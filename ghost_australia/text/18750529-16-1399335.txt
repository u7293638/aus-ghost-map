Fancy Dress Ball at Government House. The fancy dress ball given by His Excellency the Governor, and which has, for some little time, been the one theme of anticipation for Brisbane belles, took place last night at Government House. For some time before and after 10 o'clock, a continuous stream of carriages poured into the domain, each conveying its freight of beauty, tantalising a small crowd collected at the gates by glimpses of charms and costumes equally varied. Shortly after 10 o'clock the first quadrille was formed. His Excellency, in Windsor unifom, leading off with Lady O'Connell, having Lady Cockle and Sir Maurice O'Connell as vis-a-vis, her ladyship wearing the picturesque dress of a Bavarian peasant woman of the better class, and Sir Maurice having donned for the occasion the uniform of the Spanish service, under Queen Isabella, at the time when he fought to sustain her Crown. By the time this quadrille had concluded, the rooms were filled without inconvenient crowding. Quadrilles were pleasant, and round dances not only pos- sible without destruction to ladies dresses, but open enough to permit the full enjoyment of the movement and music By the time all the guests had arrived the scene was most picturesque, and the costumes were unquestionably most creditable to the taste of the wearers. There were, as usual on such occa- sions, the unavoidable duplication of characters, but on the whole independence in selection of costumes and characters had been the rule. The most striking figure to a person entering the room was unquestionably the towering height of Mr. Gardiner, in the character of Chang, the Chinese Giant, admirably dressed and got up — up nearly 7 feet. Once fairly entered, however, the eye and attention insensibly — nay sensibly — glided to the graceful and delicate forms flitting by or grouped with others around in a medley of costumes, none of which — or of the wearers — were without their peculiar charm. A most m iginfieent toilette vv is worn by Mrs George Hirns, who hid ulqiteil the Sjuan or ?«.rabian st}lo, in which the head dress and the mai gins of the lobes md sen vis alike glitter ind tinkle with coins Mis linns di ess we belnvo to liavo bun cutiiallv coiieet, as we happen 11 hive rcccutlj met with a disiriptu u of tin ¡35 n m t,ili di ess foi lulus in tho tiiivols of Ida l'fellei Gliding around, a gniciful Vi viudino assutcd the c1 nins of Turupe, and asseitid them most iluuontlv Among tho chiriitct-< with stud} m thuin, Miss On bildi ülilbuck, supported by Mrs J ihn Donólas, was paltieulnrly woithj of noti " Miss diiseldj,' says bir Wiltn Scott, " boiu upon hor head ii stiucture leseiubhug the fashion ni tho ' Lidies Memoi indian Book of 1770,' a superb pieie of uehiteetuie, not nmili less than a model u Gothic castle, au lutique flowered gown gi iced the porsou to whom belonged this unparalleled Ute Hir arms were terminated at the elbows with tupio lace mules, and, being folded ballin miva in flout, vvero decorated with long initiais of a blight ver million color, which ptesenhd no bid re semblance to a pair of gigantic lubstois ' However mcient this Gi lelilí might assume to be, she was leituuily iiiodiiu is comparnl with tin timo of tin Diuids, win bint i rcprmonta tivo in the pinion of Dr Cum in, vvhosi mjstic spells, however, would li no hid no chimo i0 mist tho nie intalions i f a most dein ling Witch, bioouihtick in h mil rupiosontid bj Miss Coutts l'owciful alike «vu limul und with the nivstic sisti rliuod, gold f und visible c\pnssi>ii in the liabihinentH of Mis D 0 Donovan, who wore a noll diesb of eloth of yild, with a How mg se u f, on w huh the names of the prim ip ii told mining disti irtH of Qiieenshnd wirowoiked in Hcirlit, the shots were oriiniiii itcd with gold, mil tho sto hing« wit'i (,'ild clocks, on hei lind wis a cn net of the sumo prieioiu metal, set off with ¡_,iuib and ni hu hand she bore tho divining i id of the ancient llliuhdn mniiceis Hie am lent A/tee rice had a ngil reviv li in the pirn li of Mr Maudsliiy, a» Mont« /mun, who hill iu-Mimcd fresh j until, and ni no wiso, wo should judgi ilntedtho magnificence of Ins linne nt Admit iti ni giv o way to risibility it the first g1 mco at a li iby of st irtling proper tions and ixrcptiotnl )nwcrH of speech and locouution, being ii) wards "' " ,l-c,t hij,h, of stalwirt build, ind an industrious «lancer This wis in fact, the humorous idei of Mr M'llvviaith, who, c1 id m long white garments, dul j furnished with coi al, rattle, AU., and with a licit cap n lim he id, aicipted the rcspniifcibilltics of his extremo youth with gi ive (liseiction As i sober Puritan, Mr Ho bert I title gio mild on the festivities from the rccesces of linn" bo its and sad garments of purple velvet In hvoly contrast was the htho figure of a l'nj,e of tho Court of the Pirst Napilcjii, adrnii ilily dicbsed by Mr 0 Miles A yung 1 idj, whoso name we did not lum, mule oin wish to be a fisher man, by her impersonation of i fish wife 1 he real (tilt) fish with which the basket on hei b ick vv as furnished vv eut ustrav in ?wicked h»iilB is tin evening advanced, and the bonn} li«h wife did not whow to least advan tagi glancing fi jm (.kamber to chamber m ho u eli of th r )11 ir 1 nungil, however, remained ni the " creel to have feilen home ernpl jyiuout to i vcrj competent lo iktiti, professional cook, W'Iiobo snovvv hibilmients weie in thcnihelve», creativi of ipj ititc fi r hiH masturpieces He ought to hive a giod figure - at least to bo good it figures-and when we mention thit Mr K It Drury wis tin military hero, we may be excused for believing that he never cooked anything—not even accounts. Mr. R. Darvall was admirably suited in a Greek dress, which brightened up every group which its wearer joined, and contrasted strikingly with the grim aspect and sombre habitments of Oliver Crom- well, whose ghost would have been mollified at the sight of his latest representative, Mr. E. J. Bennett. Mrs. Bennett was very correctly dressed as Mary of Lorraine, mother of Mary Queen of Scots. We have not, however, time to enlarge on such interesting histori- cal themes , a graceful Vu /« nine from Nor mandle flits across the scene, and puts mere coriectnessout of the quistinn Mdlle birnie Desgrands is piobibly to the manner born, and tho authenticity of hor neatlj coquettish cap and costume is beyond cntiiisui Miss Cortil, asi Chinese lady, showed another pictmes pie vination of the settings which maj asbist a pleu-mt picture Mrs \V Drury wis habited is Madam D Arbliy, niic Miss Burney, the authoress of " Lvelini Tho costume in of the time of (Jeorges II and III Mr Drury had Bought a chiricter to embody from tlie pages of Shakspcire, and gilt tcred ni metal and jewels, is Duke Vincentio, in Measure foi Meisurc I ho graver cituens of the world found exponents in Messrs O Donovan and L J Pjine The foimei, as Jacques Auguste de Thou, Itjyd Librarian tempi de Henri IV, wore in oflieml coït with silk gow n lace uibut rufHcs and wig, a cobtume which, though different fiom that in which the greit President of the Pithiaient of Pans is generally represented, is quite correct as that of the Bibliothécaire du Roi 'Hie latter, in the long fur lined garments which, too cumbrous foi the warrior, warmed the limbs of peaceful citizens in the 15th century, repio sented a greater celebity, William Clinton, the father of punting Mrs Bj rue, as a lady of the same penod, wore a white camlet robe and train, and a double turret head dress, with gos'amer veil Time was rolled still further bick by Mr K Min Dunne!!, who was very com pletely habited as a Knight Templar, elad m mail, but shielded from the fierce rays of a Pales tine sun by flow ingrobes and bw athed head dress, and from all assault« by a good swoi d and shield Sir \\.\ alter Raleigh, once more reviv ed, holds his blue andfei'ver iloak ready for not only a Queen, but any one of the pretty peasant guls, god dessea, and ladies of all epoch« who, with uni- formed officers, fox hunters, Jack tars, courtiers, knights, and jockeys, moke the whole suite hke tho ruins of a runbow Space*, time, and de scriptive power» would alike fail tis should wo endeavor furtlior descnption The materials and constiuction of ladies drtrsses we have alvva}8 considered a mystery too holy for man to approach The entire scene, wander where one liked, was bustling with animiteil uijovmciit, and glowing with conti istc-d colin Without li iv mg tho frtigue of i=eciiihiic; to thi» top if the Pyrninds the observe i looked down on man} centuries In tho garbs of ill these yeal s as îepieseutcd last nght there w is scarcely onu which did not show to iib nitigo is compared with the male habits of to ehv V, ith respect to the coutrosted periods of I ulies decoration a determination is moro diflicult The Indies of to day may yet supplv tin bit in colin windi the o}e-weary with the dingy nonti ii tints of ino Ieln gcutle nieii s dusses-nu mably beek» It appears from tlio coinpii launs c f last uie,ht, that charm in,; women lend y vee to any die.1» Dancing was kept up with the greatest vivacity till a late hour this morning. The costumes were, for a place with resources so restricted in that line Brisbane, wonderfully diversified, and were also exceedingly tasteful in almost every instance On the whole, however, novelty, antiquity and ingenuity had been racked for appropriate dresses and characters, and the result was probably a pleasing surprise to His Excel- lency the Governor. It is almost needless to add that all in the shape of physical comforts that could add to the enjoyment of those present was provided with lavish profusion. So far as spacious and well- ventilated rooms, bright lights, good music, and choice, varied, and abundant "creature comforts" could contribute to enjoyment, nothing could have been desired. By 3 o'clock the last of the bright throng of masqueraders had departed and brought to an end, perhaps the most brilliant and hospitable entertainment ever witnessed within the walls of Government House.
