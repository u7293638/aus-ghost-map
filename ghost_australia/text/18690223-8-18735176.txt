BOURKE. I am thankful to say that the weather is far cooler, though the moisture is still as badly needed ; the stock are in as fearful a state as can well be, trade is quietly giving up the ghost, and the old maxim " Aurora mentis arnica," with a good many would be useless, for there is little or nothing to be eaten. And yet we are better off than our neighbours. Walgett and Brewarrina, judging by their own scribes, are in a sad plight, while Willcania is retailing meat at sixpence, so I hear. Josephson's sheep are at large, and I dare say it is as well, but when mustering takes place (should ever such a thing be brought about) there will be found short tallies by all who have adopted this system. Dr. Roberts, accompanied by constable Laughnane, proceeded to the grave of Mrs. Gribble, (who, you will recollect, perished some time ago on the Ledanapper road), in order to disinter the body. Some tale or other about a sum of money the dead should have had in her possession, is, I believe, the cause of this move- ment. The result of the post mortem is not known. Mr. Becker has placed about his stores some huge iron tanks, to act in case of fire ; this is a wise proceeding. Joseph Lunn, at the police court, before Mr. J. Foot, chairman, and Mr. J. Becker, J.P., was fined Â£5 for illegally "using a horse. No other cases of note. The roads are lined with carriers unable to push down. The hospital is still doing well. Bourke, Saturday, Feb. 6th, 1869.
