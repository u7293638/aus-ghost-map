THE SOURCE OF SPIRITUALISM. " Spiritualism, Not of God, Nor of Man, ' was the subject of a lecture last evening by Mr James Allen at the Temperance hall Mr Andrew Murray occupied the chan Mr Allen admitted that thousands thought there must be something in what was called modern spirit manifestations, and who as ei e constantly asking, ' ' How we are to account for them A du cent answer could not be given in few words The subject must be viewed comprehensively Tosaj that this was an age of doubt and industry was no sufficient answer however true There were shells of men and women nowadays who had gone through all the forms of religious belief, religious doubt and religious unbelief, until they could no longer tell whether thcybehcAcd anything or nothing Nor Ainsit any sufficient answer treasurers to say that there was nothing new in modem spirit manifestations 01 m affirming as spiritualists did that all were everywhere surrounded by spirits They had been taught that from then childhood, and could not shake off this belief Milton had and " Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth Unseen, both when we wake in 1 when we sleep The sagacious Tolm Wesley had added As well give up the Bible. it once as our belief in apparitions ' But what persona wanted to lviioAV was how the spiritual creatures of a horn Milton spoke could throw off the Aeil and become apparitions John Wesley's sense On that point then appeal must be to the concurrent testimony of history, philosophy, and ieA station In common with other spiritualists, Mr Peebles used the great names of antiquity is his ages He talked of Sanchonnthes J'oioastei, Py flagons, Socrates, and Plato as though they were his Penates his household gods But it was merely the names of these persons that he used nothing else It was useless, however, to appeal farther back, on this or any other subject, than to the time at which the Hebrews and Greeks were brought into close contact, and their two forms of civilisation were blended together And when they came to that period, what Alias the state of the Greeks' They had adopted the cessation of other countries, which had risen and fallen, in some cases then gods, also, which were so unique and so like those by whom they were setup, as tohaAopioAoked, in later times, the cutting same e, 's The Ethiop a gods have Ltlilop s lips, Bronze cheeks, and woolly hair, The Grecian gods are like the Greeks, As seen cj c3, cold, and fair " The Giecmnahad at that time then heroes and then deities , their good and their bad spirits, then Elysian fields, and then shades for wandering and unquiet ghost, then Dionysius and then Eleusinian mysteries, then priests and their magic, their initiates and then oracles, all, in short, answering to the mediums and clan voyants of the present day, with not a few things bearing a close resemblance to modern spirit manifestations The Hebrews and Greeks had many things in common up to the commencement of the Chi strain era They both thought the return of spirits from the other world. possible They both bekeA ed in the eastern e of good and bad spirits, alike potent for good and CAll I key both had ocular demonstration of bad spirits being cast out by the an old of command Sacred history affirmed tins, and profane history attested it The spiritualists should therefore, take what was against them from both those sources as an evil as W.hat was for them Mr Peebles claimed letters Justin Martyr, Origen, Luther, John M Haley, and others as spiritualists, simply because of some expressions in their writings implying a belief in the existence of spirits But if the orthodox fathers and divines just mentioned were spiritualists, what had they in common with those at whose delight it was incessantly to denounce then orthodoxy' In his work on the philosophy of spirits in their relation to matter Di Burnett an eminent London physician, spoke of four kinds of created spirit the spirit of electricity, the spirit of life, the spirit of man, and the spirit of angels, assigning to each, in the light of philosophy and emulation, then several powers and functions The spirit of credulity was to be seen in every thing, even in inorganic and compounded substances The spirit of life and as only to be seen in building up organic structures, such as plants, animals and men, but how were they to reconcile that with what spiritualists said about spirits tying and untying hopes, 01 with what they said about sport forms being materialised ' Dr Dunn spoke of the hopes with which he was untied and tied up again at his public s√©ance here being done by Bpnit hands materialised by accretions and agglomerations of pay- tales from the bodies of those present to witness this feat But some might wish to know a little more about this piece of materialisation and the following from the Banner of Light of the 23rd of March last would throw some light on the subject. At a private seance in Boston, the medium ay. is asked - By what process do the invisibles materialise the hands, faces, and other forms that from time to time are shown at circles held for the demonstration of sport power The spirit guide of this medium mibAyered - ' 'headlined matter out of which these up directions are formed, or, at le lit, rendered cognisable by mortal senses, is gathered from the individuals composing the circle, each contributing to the supply The law material is then collected together in a miss, as the housewife having kneaded the dough for her bread prepares it to be rolled out in any form desired and a certain portion, sufficient for the manifestations about to be made, is divided from it This portion, by the subtle force of sport chemistry, is deposited in solution in a report or atmospheric both, over the heads of the circle just as copper is held in solution in the bath of the battery for election typing Immediately the spot hand, or other object, is plunged into this bath, the ear thy matter in solution becomes precipitated upon the surface of the spirit to be shown, and upon these being coated with this earthy material, it becomes tangible and visible to the physical senses." What a parody that on the functions of the spirit of life in building up organic structures by slow degrees, and accordingly fixed laws The peculiar language Avhick so called spirits often employ was then referred to, and a short description given of a private France's Melbourne, where Dr. Dunn was temporarily transformed into a negro sailor named Williams Di Dunn brought himself into London lions, and then sprang from a sofa with the exclamation-' Me Charles Williams, me Charles. Williams, me want Di Tigg Williamstown, Dr 1 iggsay mc sham , me no sham, me want tell Did lag him hair There was much more which would have been unbecoming many sport Williams was a negro seaman, who came out some time ago in the Atrato, and was reported on by Dr Figg for shamming illness, but died in the Melbourne Hospital. The behaviour of spirits which had the unhappy knack of murder ing the Queen's English justified the squib W.hich appeared long ago at the expense " If In join new estate you cannot rest, but must rem n, oh grant us this request, Come with a noble and celestial air, And pray c your titles to the names you wear, Olio somnolent token of your heavenly birth, Speak as good English as you spoke on earth, And what were once superfluous to advise, Don't tell, I pray you such c(,ro{,lous lies ' Spmtunlists did not stand alone in the belief that the spirit of man could return to eat til again But they were pretty unanimous in their belief that, although there were good angels, there were no bad ones and that was chiefly What was to be inquired into with a view to its bearing on modern sport main festations The sacred Scriptures spoke of bad as well as good angels, and they unit for only ascribed to Satan what as as done by any evil spirits, just as what was done by the subjects of armies of a country was ascribed to its mouth elm or commanders Satan worked by means, and had two special modes of attack, the one was to be seen in the super natural influence he exerted on the minds of men, the other in his taking possession of their bodies The soil coal gas and magicians of Egypt could never have thought the wonders. they did except overpower far above that of man It was moienAei.deseiv ingot a small., that allyvho practised sorcery or magic had recourse to electricity in some of its forms, or to poison one heiuS; dings, for a spoon] to assist them.

Absolute proof of the presence and mild case of evil spirits in these modem spirit manifestations outside the Scriptures was not producible Nor was there any semblance of a proof of the appearance of spots in these manifestations at all except to the alleged consciousness of the spiritualiSts themselves which was a very unsafe guide But they had to believe many things they could not understand gravitation for instance which Newton never regarded as unique and final but laboured hard to reduce to some higher law In a late lecture at St Georges Hall London Dr Carpenter had attributed the spread of spiritualism to the force of nervous sympathy But antipathy was quite as great a force and might have had quite as much to do with it as sympathy it would he very difficult task to show that the aversion of the minds of people nowadays to the doctrines pro- pounded by the early Reformers without regard to the advance of modern thought had driven them into the aims of spiritualism But spiritualism everywhere consol ted with infidelity and was on that account if on no other to be shunned At one of his lectures in Melbourne Mr Peebles first threatened to pull out a looking glass for the orthodox which he said he always earned about to confront them with and he then declared that he loved an infidel from his very heart Against those seeking such alliances caution would be superfluous
