Poetry. READER, WHAT HAST THOU THERE ? s i t is forming, forming, forming, In the vast realm unseen, God's awful exhibition, Of things that e'er have been ; The thoughts of the great Founder, The one august, I am, The doings of the Holv Ghost, The sufferings of the Lamb, The acts of all the angels Of every rank or state, The deeds of every child of earth, However small or great. And there are works of evil ones, God prant us ne'er to know The things that are exhibited 'in the dark courts of woe ! We are entering our exhibits Each day as it goes by ; Oh, think well, are they fitted For a long eternity 1 Are they wrought with patient, loving care, With self-devotion sweet, And offered in the name of Him Who makes our works complete ? But though we've sent in much that's bad, This grace to us is lent, Our contributions may be changed Before life's hour is spent. Oh, think well what thou gettest, Set down against thy name ; The issues are eternal, For glory or for shame.
