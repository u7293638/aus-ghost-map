GENERAL NEWS. IN THE COUNCIL. Seldom of late has the Legislative Coun- <*> cil been "by strangers honored," but on Tuesday the benches both above and below the clock were far from bare, and it is safe to assert that the attendance there has not been exceeded this session, except when the Governor performed the opening ceremony.
