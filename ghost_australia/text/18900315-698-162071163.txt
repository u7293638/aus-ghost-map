YGWTC FOLKS. The Sin of Omission. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undoing ^feich gives you a bit of a heart-ache At the setting of tbe sun. The tender word forgotten. The letter you did not write, Ttew fewer you might have sent, dear, 'A*re $r-ur haunting ghosts to-night. etone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way. The bit of hearteome counsel You were hurried too much to say, The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. j These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, Tfeese chances to be angeta Which even mortals find— THjey come in night and silence, ; %a&h; chill, reproachful wraith, Wten hops ts faint and flagging, And alight has dropped on faith. -'For ltfe is all too short, dear. j sorrow is all too great, buffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thine you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heart- ache At tbe Mttieg ®f tht sun. MaBGABET E. SaNGSTBU.
