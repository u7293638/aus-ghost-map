"The darkness" gave my recital of the iiicident the complexion it wanted; a tremor-passed through her hand into- my arm. It was enough to niake a very nightmare of the gloom, warm n's it . was . with: • the• dew-laden . southerly breathing, aiid delicate too witli the small fine light trembled into it by the stars, to think of a hail soundingoutof it from a phantasm as shapeless as,any • dye; of: gloom' ! ti]Wn' ; the-.cVihi>as ! -of: the night. 'Ten'mihutes passed :;'I.'theii, dis- . corned the figuresof Wilfrid and Finn coining aft. Sly cousin's deep breathing .lvas audible when he was still at a distance; "Well, what news ?

'"•-,-•'-' -.'•- "What T heard," said Wilfrid in his most raven note, "was this, ' The yacht is cwsed. Sail her home! Sail her home.!'" " "i'was as plain, Mr. Monson, as his. • honour's own voice," said Finn, in a profoundly despondent way. : .. ..; " D'ye think, Finn, said I,;".tli:ft it is a trick played off upon the crew by some skylarking son"of a gun forward?" His head wagged agamst the stars:-" I wish . I could believe it, sir. The woice was underfoot. There's nobody belonging to the ship there. ; There's no man amissing. 'Sides.'tain't a human woice. . Ifever could ha' believed it." He pulled out his pocket-handkerchief and polished . Ins brow. " Well,I cxclaimed, "so long as the thing, whatever it be, keepsforward—the deuce of it is, I've heard such sounds myself twice. It can't be fancy then.

" You may set us on fire,"said:Wilfrid;- " let the matter rost for to-niglit. Tomorrow, Finn, you can rummage the , yacht." He started violently: "What can it-. be though."
