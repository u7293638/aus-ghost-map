Trying to Please Everybody. One render cries, year strain a too grave. Too much morality you have, '■ f Too ranch about religion ; C5ivs me some witch and wisard tale* of slip-shod ghosts with fifis andgcales, Andfeather'd liken £ig6t|ju The man of dull scholastic lorfc .r Would like to see a little more Of first-rate scraps of Latin ; The grocer fain would learn the price Of tea and sugar, fruit and rice; The draper, silk and satin. Another cries, I want more fun, A witty anecdote or pun, A rebus or a riddle ; Some wish for Parliamentary news. And some, perhaps, of wiser views. Would rather have a fiddle. The cVitic, too. of classic skill, Must dip in gall his gander quill, And scrawl against the paper; Of all the literary fools, Bred in onr colleges or schools, He cuts the greatest caper. A nother cries, I want to see ,'A jumbled up variety Variety in all things; A miscellaneous hodge-podge print. Composed (I only give the hint) Of multifarious small things. 1 want some marriage news, says Miss It constitutes my highest bliss To hear of weddings plenty; For in a time of general rain None suffer from a drought, 'tis plain— At least not one in twenty. No, no, cries one, we've had enough Of such confounded love-sick staff, To erase the fair creation; €ivp us some recent foreign news, Of Russians, Turks, the Poles, the Jews, Or any other nation. I want to hear of deaths, says one— Of people totally undone By losses fire, or fever; Another answers, fall as wise, d'd rather have the fall and rise Of racoon skins and beaver. Or <#ave,or humourous, wild or tame, Lofty or low—'tis all the same, Too haughty or too humble ; So, brother Editors, pursue The path that seems the best to you. And let the grumblers grumble.
