The beautiful colored supplement is worthy of special notice. It is undoubtedly the finest «peciinen of art color printing -yes 'produced in the colonies. The drawing is perfect, the print ing gives evidence of special care, the coloring is most judicipus and effective, and the production reflects -the/highest credit upon MesBrai Georg'e Murray and Co., - Clarence-street, Sydney, who printedit to tbteorder of the proprietors -of the TOWX AXD Coy^fTRTjoTJKNil.. . . Of the illustratioiis printed in the Town and Country JouekaX itself, the first which claims attention is a charming picture ' Baby's first Christmas morning.' ' His letter' and ' Nature and Art' present two phases of ' the old old story.' Christmas in the Northern Hemisphere is illustrated by the ' Skaters in the Old Land,' 'Christmas Amusements' in ^Canada,' 'Christ- mas in Spain/'vand ' wetting the Christmas Carol Ready.' The Australian pictures are numerous. Holiday parties are shown ' Sketch ing in the Domain,' while ^'The Landing of Cook,' 'By the Sea,' '?Viola,' 'An Idyll of December,' and several other engravings are seasonable and appropriate. ' Holiday. Spo^in Australia' comprise ' A Mountain Top' in Tas-' niania, and, in New South. Wales, Peat's Ferry as it is and as it may be, other scenes on the Hawkes bury Piver, Berowra Creek, and other places. The Christmas edition of the Town and Oouktrt JouRNAi teems with tales, sketches, and ▼erses, which are appropriately illustrated, and will no doubt secure for it a hearty welcome in the town or the bush, on large squatters' stations or the smaller holdings of the seleetors.^and among the miners, the sailors, and all other classes of the community.
