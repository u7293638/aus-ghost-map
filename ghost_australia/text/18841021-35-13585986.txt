SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. > . I [Br TB-EGiiArH.l (FRoM our SPECIAL n.EroRTEn.1 FLEMINGTON TRAINING NOTES. MELBOURNE, MONDAY. There were very few persons at Flemington this morning, and the work done was not interesting. Fryingpan, Vergy, Lord Wilton, Hastings, and most of the others that raced at Caulfield on Saturday were restricted to cantering. Martini-Henry was not out, and it is thought that he is lame. Bargo and Tremando cantered, and ran a fast half-mile. Bargo is very well, but Treamndo dragged his off hind leg in a suspicious manner, and unless eased in his work will probably go wrong. Tempo, Iolanthe, Monto Christo, tend Despot were sent to slow work, but I did not toe Uralla. Fare, who looks well, did moderate work on the sand track. Plaueiblo went nicely on the tan. Buri Ida cantered and spurted; and after a long canter Warwick spun along for half a mile. Lamond sontPhaon, Burford, Magnifier, Toward, and Tremulous to useful exercise, and I like the two last named beat. Le Grand was treated to a good working gallop. Sir Modred performed an easy task, and Guefswork, who is in great form for the time, sweated and finished up smartly. Hurricane, The Broker, Leporello, Tasco, The . Pencil, Sir Garnet, Signor, and a lot of others did slow work. Anchorite is doing well at Queenscliff, and at Caulfield the most solid work is being done by Umbra, Mistake, Moeart, The Ghost, Melodious, Coriolanus, Norfolk, Ontario, and Violet A great deal of strong work is sure to be done at Flemington to-morrow.
