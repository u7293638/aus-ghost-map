VISIT TO CANTERBURY. ; On July 30 a largo party of colonists visited the .historio Cathedral town of Canterbury, in Kent. They were received with, an address of wei como, for whioh Sir - George ' Bowen, Governor of Hongkong, returned thanks ; and, after being taken in procession by way of the Dane John through the principal street of the town to the Cathedral, over whioh they were shown, they were entertained at lunoheon presided over by the Mayor of Canterbury, supported by tho Archbishop. We'eive a couple of illustrations of soenos connected with this visit. One shows the viaitors, preceded by the Mayor and Corporation of Canterbury, going to service at the Cathodral through " tho Dark Entry," a passage leading from the green court to the Cathedral, and celebrated b√©oauso supposed oven now by many poople to bo haunted by the ghost pf "Nell Cook." This super natural tale is ridiouled, it may be remembered, in " The Ingoldsby Legende." Another illustration shows the reception of tho visitors at Christchurch gate by the Archbishop and clorgy, and their introduction to the Dean. Christchurch gate, though of sufficiently venerable-age, is not nearly as old as many other parts of the Cathedral, having been ereotedA.D. 1467. Tt'iea' beautiful struoturo, and is a perfootly typical example of an old English building.
