A QUAKTITY of hay, about 100 tons, has, within the past few days, been pressed at list larat, and forwarded to Melbourne for shipment as fodder for horses on the passage to India. Mr Nicholl of Armstrong-street, sent sixty ton;, and Mr Laing, Cres wick-road, forty tons" The Star remarks that " the time for the execution of such an order was very opportune, and though without visible effect on the list of the prevailing low prices, the new demand had a favorable effect in relieving the market of an over-supply." THE trial of Howard's steam plough trill take place on land at tho rear of the Cumberland Hotel, Smeaton, on Thursday next, under the auspices of the Smeaton, Spring-hill, and Ballarook Agricultural Association. The trial ml] continue for several days, so that the district farmers will have an opportunity of fairly judging of the merits of the plough. A TBATHLLING musician, a dulcimer player, named Christopher ^Nelson, who had been errested^ at M'ivor on warrant, charged with deserting his family, was brought up at the City Police Court on Friday last. His wife, who had two very prepossessing children with her, said that for the last four years he had nerer contributed 'anything towards the support of the children, but afterwards corrected herself, and admitted that once during that time he had been seized with a fit of generosity and bought them some "lollies." She said she wanted nothing for herself, only for the children, as Eho could earn sufficient by her needle, as she had done during the past four years. The prisoner, who did not seem to consider he had done anything amiss, accused his wife of the very worst prefiigacy, and offered to substantiate his accusation if allowed time to bring forward witnesses. The magistrate granted a remand, but at the same time distinctly refused to accept the msn's om recognizance to appear, evidently expecting that the prisoner, i£ once out of the guardianship of the police, would rapidly make himself scute.

" . - I Eeceikss ocoukdeel.—A shocking accident, caused by the misbehaviour jjf a drunken [conndreli occurred on the Macquarie river at Jathurst, New Ssuth Wales, lastweek. It was it six o'clock and dark, when the boat iuilt by Cobb and Co. was engaged in conveying the nails and parcels brought by. the coach across the lira. There were a number ofpersons waiting (o be ferried over from the Kelso side, and ^linstthewish of the person inchareeof the boat, seTen or eight of these persons jumped in, aid amongst them a drunken ruffian who, seeing a female in the boat, stood on the gunwale nd commenced rocking from side-to side, destpHe all entreaties. The boat was very deep in the water, the sides being not more than a few itches abore its level. When the centre of the ctream was reached, an extra lurch given by the fellow turned the boat completely over, and the passengers were precipitated into the river. All were sared but two—Mr Caples and Mrs Croft —who were drowned, and though the river was . Hugged all nest day, their bodies were not retorered. The Sydney Eaipire remarks had such ia act been perpetrated in America, it is more to probable the delinquent would have been himg on the £rst tree available for the purpose; aid ifever Lynch-law could be justified, it would bin been in this instance.
