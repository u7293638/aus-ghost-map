NEW ENGLAND. (Walcha Witness,'Sept, 26.) Another skeleton has been found at Yarrowitch, and appears to be the remains of a woman. Mr. W. Nivison has reported the matter to the police. The skull was found by a boy who was looking for nests among rushes in the creek, and near the spot where timid folks have seen the river mist rise, which to them looked like a ghost. On Sunday morning Messrs. Perry and Hollander (chemists) were standing near the surgery door when a flash of lightning passed down tbe telephone wire and struck Mr. Perry on the leg, partially paralysing that member, and giving our worthy chemist a wholesome dread of electricity. A most unnatural scene has been witnessed at the Villa, Walcha, recently, A cat which had been deprived of its young took to two newly-born pigs, and attended and nurtured them as though they were her own. The cat experienced difficulty in lifting the "suckers " by the neck, as each time' she attempted to do so the animals naturally squeaked. One pig was killed by accident a few days ago, and now the foster-mother has but one porker to guard and suckle. On Sunday last a violent hail storm broke over Walcha shortly before noon, the ground being covered with the large white stones. Travellers and live stock who were unfortunate enongh to be caught in the storm had by no means a pleasant time.
