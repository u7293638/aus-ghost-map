Sally sat up prim, as if she were pinned to the clair burgher hands crossed genteely upon her lap, and her eyes, * looking straight into the fire Mammy Jones tried to strangle tt%p'l?^iSelf too, and laid her hands across in her lap ; but they would not lay still.

The drops of sweat began to 'crawl all over me. I got my eye upon my bat hanging on a peg, on the road to the door, and then I eyed the door. At ''this n orient the old Captain nil at once song out, "Johnny Bi edge !" It sounded like a clap of thunder, and I started right us on unless.

Poor Sally made but one jump, and landed in the middle of the kitchen ; and then she skulked in the dark corner, till the old man, after laughing himself into a whooping-cough, was put to bed. Then came apples and cider , and the ice being broke, I had plenty of chat with Mammy Jones, about the Minister and to the " Barrosa." I agreed with her to a nicety upon all the points of doctrine ; hut I had forgot the text and the heads of the discourse', but six. Then she teased and tormented me to tell wits I accounted the best singer in the gallery that day, But, mum there was no getting that out of me. Praise to the face is often disgrace," says I, throwing a sly squint at Sally. At last, Mrs. Jones lighted another candle; and, after charging Sally to look well to the fire, she led the way to Mya, and the Squire gathered up his shoes and stockings, and followed. I . Sally i and I were left sitting a good yard apart, honest measure. For fear of getting tongue-tied again I straight in With a Steady stream of talk.

',. . . ><",'? ?? ; ;..-:; one's v.*.>,»"*f'.;/: In Taylor's Mystery of Ghosts, a very en- tertaining work, and full of interest to the lovers of the mar- vellous, is a collection of stories that have been handed from grandam to child, from time immemorial, and among which is the following :-'' The bridge over the River Usk, near Caerleon, a small town in Wales, is made of wood, and is very curiously constructed ; the tide rising occasionally to the almost incredible height of fifty or sixty feet. The boards which compose the flooring of this bridge being de- signedly loose, in order to float with the tide, when it ex- ceeds a certain height, are prevented from escaping only by little pegs at the end of them-- a mode of fastening which does not afford a very safe footing for the travellers, and hence some awkward accidents have been known to arise. Among other Singular accidents that have occurred, the following happened to a Mrs. Williams, who had been spending a com- fortable winters evening with a friend on the opposite side of the river to her own house and was returning rather late at night. It being extremely dark she provided herself with a lantern and candle, by the assistance of which she found her way to the bridge, and had already passed some of the pre- carious structure, when she unfortunately trod upon plank that had by some accident lost the tenous originally fixed to the end of it, and had slipped from its proper situation. The faitless board yielded at once to the weight of the good lady, who was rather corpulent, and carried her through the flooring, with her candle and lantern to the river. Fortu- nately, at the moment of falling she was standing in such a position, as gave her a seat on the plank similar to that of a horseman on his nag. It may be easily imagined that Mrs. Williams must have been dreadfully alarmed at this change of position, as well as difference of element. Blessed, how - ever, with great presence of mind, and a patient en- durance of evil, the good lady was not overwhelmed by her fall, but steadily maintained her seat on the board ; taking care, at the same time, to preserve her candle lighted, right- ly supposing it would serve as a guide to any one who might be willing to assist her. Thus bestriding the plank, our heroine was hurried down the river towards Newport, the bridge of which she trusted would stop her progress ; or that she might alarm the inhabitants by her cries. In both her hopes, however, she was disappointed ; the raipdity of a spring tide sent her through the arch, with the velocity of an arrow discharged by a bow, and when the good people of the town had long been wrapped in slumber. Thus situated, her pros- pect became each moment more desperate : her candle was nearly extinguished, and every, limb so benumbed with cold, that she had the greatest difficulty in keeping the saddle. Already had she reached the mouth of the Usk, and was on the point of encountering the turbulent waters of the channel, when the master of a fishing boat, who was returning from his nightly toils, discovered the gleaming of her taper, and thinking her a witch, was. endeavouring to avoid her ; but hearing her calls for assistance, at length ventured ap- proach the floating wonder, and happily succeeded in rescuing the sufferer from a watery grave, by bringing her in safety to the shore in his boat A short time before the publication of the memoirs of John Evelyn, which made so much noise in the literary world a few years ago, Mr. Upcott, of the London Institution, was at Wotton, 10 Surry, the residence of the Evelyn , family, and sitting after supper chatting with LadY *%ely^äod Mrs. M ' tippet made of feathers, on which the latter was employed. "All, Mrs. Moly near x, we have all of us our. bobbies," said Mr. Upcott. ." Very true, Mr. Upcott," rejoined Lady; Evelyn, "and may I take the liberty of enquiring what your's issues Wiry mine, Madam," replied Mr. Upcott, has been from an early age the collecting of the hand-writing of men of eminence." " What, I suppose then," said Mrs. Molyneux, 3 you would care for Such things as these," unfolding' one of her thread cases; which was formed of a letter written by Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. " " Indeed, I should very, much,'' replied Mr. Upcott; " Oh, if that be your taste," said Lady Evelyn, " weeds easily satisfy you; This house is full of such matters there is a whole washing basket fall of letters and other papers of: old Mr. Evelyn's'in the garret, which I was, so tired of seeing, that I ordered the housemaid the other day to light the fire with, but probably she. may not have yet done it." The bell was rung the basket was yet untouched, and the result of this accidental conversation was the publication of the memoirs of John Evelyn. . i ; It has been generally remarked, that all new settled countries exhibit most wretched specimens of-taste in their nomenclature of places. We have in our own Colony, many instances of this, such as the " Fat-doe. Ewes," .
