' : 'In spite of this, however,' went on Vol taire without heeding Miss Staggles' qaery, 'she has a great jleal of romance in 'her na ture; has a-sttdng-io.ye'Yor mystery, sff:muen so that she is in some things a trine super stitious.' . v -- - ..??.?? -? ? rt. 'I can't say as to that, but I should think you are correct.' : j 'Then she's a young lady of very strong likes and dislikes; but at bottom is of. a very affectionate nature.' 'Affectionate to nearly every one but me,' muttered Miss Staggles. -- 'She is intensely proud—' . --?? 'As Lueifer!' interrupted Bfiss Staggles. 'This is her great weakness,', went on Vol taire. 'Her pride will overcome her judg ment, and because of it she will do things for which she will afterwards be sorry. Is this true?' ? . - , 'True to the letter: Tou must be a wizard, Herod Voltaire, or you couldn't have sum med up her disposition so correctly.' 'Her sense of honor is very great. She would sacrifice her happiness to do what was thought to be honorable.' 'I believe she would.' '.'Then my path Js marked out,' said he, savagely. . From that time I eould-vcatch nothing of what. was eaid, although' -they conversed for five minutes at least. But it was In whis pers, bo low that! couldnot -catch a word. Presently they: got upancl'went away, while I, with aching head and. fast-beating heart, tried to think what to do. Every thing was mystery. I- could not 6ee a step before me. Why should Miss Staggles be eo willing to help Herod Voltaire, and what were the de Signs in his mind? .What was his purpose in getting at a correct estimate of Miss For rest's character? I went to the house pondering these things in my mind, and, arriving there, ' beard the hall clock strike the quarter, from which I knew it was a' quarter 'past six. We were to dine at seven 'that day, and, as 1 did not usually make an elaborate toilette, I knew I had plenty of time. I felt I could not go in for a few minutes; my brain eeemed on fire. I turned to take a walk' towards the park gates, 'when I heard a footstep, and turning, saw Simon Slowden. : 'Can you give me ten minutes before din ner, sur?' he said. \ 'I dare. say,' I said. - .„ - : ..? ? He led me into the room in which We had spoken together before. 'There's something wrong, yer honor,' he said in a low voice. 'How do you know?' ? 'Why, that 'ere JUgyptiajr hev bin doggin' me all day. He's got a hinklin' as how we're tryin' to match 'em; and ..reckons as hpw I'm yer friend. Besides, to-^ay when I feee you ride hoff with the young lady, I thinks to myself, 'There's no knowjn' what time he'll be back.' I knows what 'tis, yer honor; hi've bin in the arms o', Wenus myself, and knows^as'ow a hour slips la way like a min nit. So as there wur no teUin' if you would get to the summer-house to-night at five o'clock, I thought I'd just toddle up myself. But 'twas no go. I sees they two willaina a-talkin' together, and when that 'ere Wol taire went off by himself; :the other took it 'pon hhn to keep wi' me. I tried to git 'im off, but 'twas no use; he stuck to me like a; limpet to a rock.' 'Perhaps it was all fancy, Simon.' 'No 'fancy. in me, but .a:.; lot o' judgment. Fact, sur, I've begun to -think for the fust time as 'ow some things in the Bible ain't true. In the Psalms of Solomon it reads, ?Resist the devil and he'll go away howlinV Well, ' I've resisted that 'ere devil, and he wouldn't go away till, he'd knowed as how he'd played his little game;' and Simon look ed very solemn indeed. ; 'Is that all. Simon?' : 'All, yer honor. 'Tisn'txmuch, you think; but to me it looks mighty suspicious, as I eaid to my sweetheart 'when I see her a huggin' and kissin'.the -coachman.' I went away 'laughing, but my heart was still heavy- Try as 1 would, I could nof dis pel the fancy that soon something terrible would happen. - During dinner Kaffar made himself very disagreeable. This was somewhat unusual, as he was generally very bland and polite, but to-night he was eo cantankerous that I fancied he must have been drinking. To me he was especially insulting, and went so far as to hint that I, unlike other English men, was a coward;' thaf-i hadn't courage to resist a man manfully, but would act to wards an enemy -in- a cunning,- serpent-like way. This was -not. the' first occasion on which he had sought to pick a quarrel with me, and I felt like resenting It. I desisted, however, as there were jfadles present, and went on quietly talking to iriy neighbor as if he hadn't spoken. This -roused his ire more, while I saw that Voltaire watched me Tvith Jiis light guttering eye, as If expecting a scene. ? ' : ' - - After dinner, this being isew year's l-ay, we passed a more than usually merry time. Stories were told, old ballads were sung, while Roger deCoverley- was danced hi down right earnest by most of. those who were pre sent. By midnight; however, the old hall was silent; each of us had repaired to his room,. and most, I expect, were quietly asleep, when a terrible «eream was. heard, after which there were ebonis for help and hys terical cries. The sounds seemed to come from the direction of the servants' hall, and, quickly putting on some clothes, I hurried thither. I soon found; that the noise had roused the whole household, and. so, when I arrived, I found a number of the guests had gathered together. On looking Into the room, I saw that the housekeeper was. lying, in a swoon, one of fh'e servants wajs in hysterics, while Simon Slowden, 'wnp ? was Jh the ioom, and the page boy looked as white as sheets, and were trembling evidently with fear. 'What does this mean?' asked Tom Tem »le. a little angrily. ? At this the housekeeper became conscious and said in a. ^hoarse whisper, 'Is ehe gone?' 'What? Who do you mean?' asked Tom. 'Tihe hall iady,' she said fearfully. ; , : \--? 'We are=alL*riendB here^' «aid Soni, and I . thought ; I detected ah amouiit of 'anxiety'in his voice. :..-,.-_ ? ... This appeared to sssure the housekeeper, who got up and tried to collect her thoughts. We all waited anxiously -for her to speak. ? 'I have, stayed up late, Mr. Temple,' ;She eaid to ^Tom, L'in order to '-^rrangie. somewhat for the party ^ou propose giying on; Thursday.

'And what did you think' ehe was like?' 'Like the hall ghost, as I've heard so much i about,' said Simon. ''.'?/'??' '.''',- 'The hall ghost!' cried the ladies, hysteric ally. 'What does that mean, Mr.ijTemple?' I do not think 'Tom should'ha^* encouraged their superstition by telling them, but he did. He was excited, and scarcely knew. what was best to do. 'They say that,- like other 'old houses, Tem^ pie Hall Bias its ghost,' he said; 'that she usually appears on New Tear's night. If the year is to be good to those within at the time, j she comes with flowers and dressed in gay j attire; if bad, she is clothed ha black; if j there's to be death for any one, she wears a j shroud.^ But it's all nonsense, you know,' j said Tom, uneasily. i 'And she's come in a shroud,' said the ser- j vant who had been in hysterics, ''and there i were epots of blood upon it, and that means that the one who dies will be murdered; and there was a knife in her hand, And that means that 'twill be done by a knife.'. It would be impossible to describe the ef fect this girl's words made. She made the ghost very real to many, and the calamity i which she was supposed to foretell seemed certain to come to pass. I looked at Ger trude Forrest and Ethel Gray, who, wrapped in their dressing- gowns, stood side by side, and I saw that both of them were terribly, moved, Voltaire arid Kaffar were both there, but they -uttered no word. They, too, seemed to believe in the reality of the apparition. After a great deal of questioning on the part of the lady guests, and many soothing replies on the part of the men, something like quietness was at length restored, and many of the# braver ones began to return to their rooms, until Tom and I were left alone in the servants' hall. We again questioned the servant^ but .with the same result, and then we went quietly upstairs. Arriving at the landing, we saw Miss Forrest and Miss Gray leaving Mrs. Temple at the. door of her. room. Tom hurried to Miss Gray, and took her by the hand, while I, nothing loth, spoke to Miss Forrest. - 'There's surely .some trick in this,' I said to her. . . ...... 1 felt her hand tremble in mine as she | spoKe. i ao not. Know. it seems lernmyM real, arid I have heard of such strange1 things.' ''?„?. 'But you are not afraid? ; If you are, 1 shall be up all night, and will be so happy to help you.' . ? I thought I felt a gentle pressure of her hand, but I was not sure; but I know that her look made me veTy happy as she, together with Edith Gray, entered her room a few j minutes after. j When they had gone, . I said to Tom, 'I am j not going to bed to- night' 'No?' said Tom. 'Well, I'll, stay up with you.' \ ' 'This ghost affair Is nonsense, Tom. I hope you will not find any valuables gone to morrow.' i 'Real or not,' said Tom, gaily, 'I'm glad it came.' * 'How's that?' 'It gave me nerve to pop the question,' hfc replied. 'I told my little girl Just now— for ] she is mine now— that she wanted a strong : man to protect such a weak .little darling.' ! 'And she?' ?:.'?? 1 'She said that she knew of no one, whom she liked, that eared enough for her to protect her. So I told her I did, and then— well, what followed was perfectly satisfactory.' I congratulated frim on his audacity, and ] then we spent the night ha wandering about ! the first floor of the house, trying to find the ] ghost, but in vain; and4 when the morning j came, and we all tried to laugh at the ghost, j I felt that there was a deep, sinister meaning | in it all, and wondered what the end would be. CHAPTER X. Directly after breakfast I went away alone. I wanted to get rid of an awful : weight which oppressed me. I walked Tapidly, for the morning was cold. I had scarcely reached the park gates, however, . when a hand touch ed me. I turned and saw Kaffar. 'I hope your solitary walk Is pleasant,' he said, revealing his white teeth. 'Thank you,' I replied, coljlly. I thought he was going to leave me, but he kept close by my eide, as if he wanted to say something. I did not encourage him to speak, however; I walked rapidly on in si lence. 'Temple Hall is a eurions place,' he said. 'Very,' I replied. 'So different from Egypt— ah, . so different There the skies are bright, the trees are al ways green. There the golden sandhills stretch away, the palm trees wave, the Nile sweeps majestic. There . the cold winds scarcely ever blow, and the people's hearts are warm.' 'I suppose so.*' ?'??* ' : '? 'There are mysteries there,' as jn Temple Hall, Mr. Blake; but mysteries are sometimes of human origin.' . . : : '.'?: As he said this ib.e leered up; into my face, as if to read my thoughts; 5-ut t governed my features pretty well, and thus, I thinly deceiv ed him. , .. ' _.;,,/'? ' .? '' 'Perhaps you 'know this?' he. said, . .'. 'No,' I replied. '? 'I ain connected with no 'mysteries.' /. . ,.

I looked at him m astonishment The In sinuation was so far .from true that for the moment I was too surprised' to speak. .?'... : He gave a fierce, savage laugh, and clapped his hands close against my face. 'I kiaew' I was right' he said; and then',: before I had time to reply, he turned on Ms heel and walk ed away. . . -/ . . ' '::' ?.'. . Things were indeed taking curious' turns, and I wondered what would ^happen next . What motive, I asked,* could Kaffar- have Jn -connecting me, with the ghost^ and what was the .plot which wag being concocted? Thei-e in the broad daylight the apparition seemed very unreal. The servants,, alone in the hall at midnight, perhaps talking, about the tra ditional ghost, could easSyVl&ave; ^Tightened themselves into the belief that ihey had seen it - Or perhaps one '^of - their leUowrservants sought to play them: a' trick, and ran away when- heeaw -what he had done.

At first he did^nothing but stare vacantly, but presently a' Ibok'of 'mtelligence flashed into his. .ejjeB... iThen he gave a shrug^-as, if he !mos .riaisgusted with himself, whicti was followed by jurexpr^ssion of grim determma tion.. 'Master Blake,' he said solemnly, 'it's that waccinatin' process as hev done it. Simon Slowden couldn't hev bin sich a nincompoop if he hadn't bin waceinated 'gainst whoopin' cough, measles, and emall-pox. r Ter hpffor,*, ' he continued, 'after I wur waccinated Ibroke; out in a kind of rash all over^ and. that .'ere~ rash niust have robbed me of my senses; but I'm blowed— — There, I can't say fairer nor that.' 'Why, what do you ,thmk?' 'I daren't tell you, yer honor, for fear Til make another mistake. I thowt, sur, as it would take a hangel with black wings to nick me like this 'ere, and now -I've bin done by somebody; but it's the waccinatin', yer honor — it's the waeeination. In* the Proverbs of Job we read, 'Fool and his money soon part^ ed,' and so we can see 'ow true the teachitf is to-day.' 'But what is to. be done, Simon?' ! Simon shook his head, and then said solemn ly, 'I'm away from my bearin's, sur. I thought when, I. wur done the last time it should be the last time. It wur in this way; sur. I was In the doctor's service as wac cinated me. Says he, when he'd done, 'Si mon, you'll never have small-pox now.' 'Think not?' says I. . 'Never,' says he; and when Susan the 'ousemaid heard on it, she says, 'I am so glad, Simon.' Then, says I, 'Susan, when people are married they're con verted into one flesh. That's scripter. You get married to me,' says I, 'and you'll be ke.pt free from small-pox, without this yer willifyin' process.' Wi' that she looks at me, andishe says, 'You are purty, and I'll try you for three months; if you don't get small pox in that time, why then— we'll talk about it' So I says, 'Say yes at once, Susan. The doctor says I can't get it, so there's no sort o' fear.' I wur young and simple then, and thowt doctors never made a mistake. Well, sur, in two months more I were down wi' smallrpox, and when I got up again I wur a sight to behold. As soon as I wur fit to be seen I went to Susan to git a mite o* comfort, and then I see 'er a-eourtin' wi' the coach man. And I says to myself, 'Simon Slow den,' I says, 'this yer -is the last tune you must be ever taken in;' and now I'm right mad that I should 'a bin licked in this ver .way.' . . . . 1 could not help laughing at Simons story, in spite of my heavy heart, and so I asked him what the doctor said when he found vac cination a failure. . ? ?- ? 'Sent me off without a character, sur,' he replied grimly. ? 'Said he couldn't keep a servant as would be a liyin' advertisement as ow his pet 'obby.wer a failure. And so I allays say as 'ow waccination Is my ruin. It's ruined my blood and weakened my brain. Still,' continued Simon, with a sly look 'I reckon as 'ow I'll. be a match for that 'ere doubly waceinated ghost as frightened me 60. (To be continued.)
