At 1 «.r.i. oo Mond ay Abe comtricQccd dug ging hcr anchors, tnd lit 4 she is tuppoeed to have parud one of hcr chains, as, in half an hour afur, tbc snip struck heavily a'oaft, tbc sea making a cleun Vtcach over bcr. At 6 iO she canned troad^iric to ibe t-urf and commezicid breaking up. Until day light, a period of about two hours from the time of the vc»4tl going uhbmr, tbc crew were in a very uncomfortable und pre canous pfititi» n ; but ihty were tben bjfely landed thro»j»b tbc turf, chiefly Oirougb the aiHiKtance of natives, -wbo sifeintUd in gio«t number a:.d rendered every help in their power.

It was a fortunate circumstance that the c^rgoof tbCfbip bad been all but discharged, if we except tbc coula at Ihe bottom of the hold— forpinaic not m^relv aa respects tbe Toluc of ibe goods, but as rendering the ship so light thai she vur drives well upoc tbe b-aclf ; tfaub giving the crcw a chance to fate their lives. In tbe courBCof Monday the wind was still Tcry hipb, and it was feared that ihe wieck would completely hrtbk up. A curvey waa immediately beld ; end, for the bcnclit of tbo^e concerned, an immediate sale of the wreck was deemed advisable. Accordingly, at four o'clock, the *I.kIc wa* put up by Mr. Jani*ch Tbo bull, spar--, sails, rjyging, realised £35— tbe purchaser being Mr. U, 12, O.

Tbc loss of tfcie hoc sbip haa thrown a gioom over tho mcrcancilccommunuy. Apart from ibe eerioos destruction of property, it Is not impro bable that tbc character of the poit may suffer in tbc estimation or Engliab tfalpowiicrs and underwriters, We mav remark, how ever, tbat tbe suddenness as well as strength of tEc gale were all tint unprecedented ; and that, even ln the be*t harbour* of which tbe colony can boatt, wc read of vessels in heavy weather drag ging IfceJr anchors and getting ashore. It w much to bo regretted that the heavy moorings for tlie roadstead, so mo titnc sinuo sunt for by tbe Provincial Government, had not arrived ; at, bv their mcunv, the ship might possibly have held on until tbc gale abated, Thcj eio esiiK-ctfd to reach Napier iu November neat ; as well as a life bout built for tbis port and one of Manby's mortars for tbe primer ration of life from ti-rccUed vef«ls.
