? GHOST ILLUSION. There is at present'on view in Hindleystreet, Cyclorama Buildings, a cleverly conceived ghost illusion. Although the title suggests something ghastly a visit to the illusion would turn fear to merriment. It is the idea of Professor A. Bousmard, who has travelled with it in South Africa and Australia with great success. The Professor first gives an ex. ceedingly clevet musical imitation of a storm at sea on a piano. He also reproduces on the instrument—which, by-the-way, is a very superior one—the chime of bells as pealed in the old Canterbury Cathedral, England. The visitor is then ushered into Ghostland, and while he is wondering whether he is to be transported to some out-of-the-way place an exceedingly animated and kindly looking skeleton appears on the scene. All fear, if there is any, is then dispersed, for in time to MNBIC the ghost dances a Highland fling or an Irish jig, and his antics provoke mu;h laughter. He then proceeds to disconnect binwelf. Fust b'S legs dance out of sight, then his body departs, and finally bis head. The show is well worth a visit, for it is genuine, no glass or phosphorus being used in the production of the illusion, while to the Children visiting the entertainment useful gifts are presented. Professor Bousmard will stay in Adelaide for a season, and during that time flhould receive liberal patronage.
