IPoetrp For tlioscwlio Fail, •< All honor to hini who shall win the prize," The world has cried for a thousand years; But to him who tries, and who.failB, and .dies, . _-. • '.' I give great honor, and glory, and tears. Give glory, and honor, and pitiful tears To «U who fatt in their deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were 'torn with Time in advance of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a' name, ' Bat greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who retrains from wine; But the man who fails and yet still fights on, Lo, he Is the twin-horn brother of mine.
