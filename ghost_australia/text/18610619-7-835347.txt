SOUTH AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. TUESDAY, JUNE 18. The PRESIDENT took the chair at 2 o'clock. STEAM POSTAL SERVICE. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE wished to ask a question of the Hon. the Chief Secretary, it* lie would allow him todo so; it was as to whether the Government intended to take any action in reference to the steam postal service from King George's Sound? The Hon. the CHIEF SECRETARY replied that it was not intended to take any action at present, but the Govern- ment would take the sense of the House of Assembly to ascertain whether the House desired that any change should le made before the end of tho next, liuaiicial year. TheHon.G. 51. WATERHOUSE would express the hope that the sense of the Council would be taken by the Govern- ment, ns well as that of the House of Assembly, as it was during last session. COURT OF APPEAL. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE did not wish to proceed with the motion standing in his name (for the production of correspondence), as Hie papers asked for were alreadv made public. The Hon. the CHIEF SECRETARY said he had obtained the Governor's consent to lay on the table the papers asked for, and which he had receivad from His Excellency before coming to the House. Ile would move that the papers be printed. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE seconded. Carried. The Hon. the PRESIDENT, looking at the papers, said they were not exactly what the motion of the lion, member asked for, as the whole correspondence was not given, but only a portion of it. REAL ESTATE DESCENT BILL. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE, in moving the second reading of the Real Estate Descent Hill, said that in intro- ducing the Bill he had fully explained his reasons tor so doing ; it was therefore unnecessary to go over the same ground again. He did not Intend to proceed further at pre- sent than to move the second reading of the Bill, for since he Introduced it, he had received some kind suggestions lor its improvement from the Attorney-General, and he would endeavour to have those improvements introduced into the Bill, iu readiness for its consideration in committee in a fortnight hence. He trusted there would be no objection on the part of lion, members to tliat course. He would move the second reading of the Bill. The Hon. H. AYERS said that, but for the observations just made by the hon. mover, he would have felt it Ins dut y to oppose the second reading of the Bill, on account of its containing no information on the face of it as to what the intended alteration ol the law really was to be; but as the hon. member had promised to have certain improvements in the Bill prepared within the next fortnight, he would not oppose it. The Bill contained a reference to Act 27 of Henry VIII., and to chattels ami chattels real; if the lion, member would be prepared to explain all that was intended hy those term?, he would support the second reading. The Hon. G. HALL said when the lion, member intro- duced the Bill he gave a long and lucid explanation of what it sought to do. After that statement he certainly expected something more than the Bill now before the Houna ; its only recommendation was its brevity, but even brevity mfght be carried to too great a length. It referred to Henry VIII. ; well, they all knew that monarch was a great reformer, but he was also a great brute-(laughter)-and why should they copy into their statute book any Act from Henry VIII.? His Acts generally smelt of blood and pecula- tion. (Laughter.) Why should the bon. member go back to the dark ages? As to "chattels real," he had consulted books on the subject, and he found that chattels real meant leasehold property, or an estate inferior to the fee simple. He liad an objection to the Bill on account of its referring to a statute ol' Henry VI11. ; the altered state of Â»ociety at the present time showed that lew laws made so long ago could be applicable in the nineteenth century. Ile did not intend to oppose the second reading of the Bill, but he heped for further light during the ensuing fortnight. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE scarcely felt it his duty to stand forward as the advocate of his sacred Majesty Henry VIII-(laughter)-uor to defend all the actiuns of that monarch. (Laughter.) Still, although his character might not be defensible, some ol' the Acts of his reign might be beneficial and worthy to be copied. H not, the lion. member should move for leave to bring in a Hill to sweep away every vestige of Henry Vlll.'s legislation from the Statute Book. (LaughterJ He would not refer to other matters noticed by the lion, member, 3Ir. Hall, as he would have occa- sion to speak more particularly about them in Committee. The object of the Bill, as he stated when he lirst introduced it, was to render more equitable the division of intestate estates Chattels real were correctly stated; by the lion, member; they were considered as of less value than fee-simple ; but it was not. always so: even a lease might be for 99 years, or for 909 years. A measure of that kind had been seven or eight years ago introduced into Par- liament by the then Attorney-General, 3Ir. Hanson ; but nothing was done with it, he believed, beauseof the expected change in the Constitution. No action having been taken since he determined to take the matter up. Since he gave notice and introduced the Bill, he had found reason to believe that alterations were desirable, and he therefore now pro- posed a postponement for a fortnight before the Bill was taken into Committee. The Supreme Court now sitting occupied so much of the time of the Attorney- General that he could not obtain his assistance to perfect the Bill sooner than the time he mentioned. The Hon. the PRESIDENT said, before putting the ques- tion, that he thought it his duty to make an observation, which, but for the peculiar circumstances of the case, he would not have felt entitled to do. The title of the Bill stated it to be an Act to regulate the descent of real estate ; but it did nothing of the kind ; its intention seemed to be to con vei t all real property into personal property, whether per- sons died intestate or not ; the Bill said nothing about per- sons dying intestate. The Hon. .1. 31. SOLO SION said, from the expressions which had fallen from the bon. President, and which had great force iu his opinion, he hoped the lion, member would see the desirability of withdrawing the Bill with a view to amend it. The Bid did not do what its title implied, and he thought it should be withdrawn in order that it might be amended. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE rose to ask, as he had already availed himself of his right to reply, whether, he eould again reply to the lion, member? The lion. J. .31. SOL03IOX did not understand the lion. member to have replied ; he thought he was merely makinga few remarks in explanation. He had supported the Bill, on its first reading, on the understanding ol' the explanation given of its object by the lion, meunier, but he regretted to be unable to support the second reading, as the Bill should be consistent with its title. Ile therefore hoped the lion, member would withdraw it in the meantime ; he did not wish to shelve the Bill as he thought the lion, member might reintroduce it iu an amended form as soon as he chose. The Hon. J. II. BARROW said, if the question went to a division, he would vote for the second reading of the Bill, by which, however, lie should be simply committing himself to the title of the Bill, and not to the clauses. The clauses might be amended in Committee. It was, however, for the hon. member to decide, since it was alleged that the clauses would not carry out the title. He felt, however, no difficulty In voting for a Bill to regulate the Descent of Real Estate, and if the clauses were not adapted to carry out the object, they must amend those clauses. (II ear. ) The Hon. the PRESIDENT said such a course would establish an inconvenieut precedent, and if it were carried, .ny other Bill might be brought into the House difleriug from its title. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE said there certainly were no words in the clauses ot the Bill to express exactly the purpose of it, but the effect of tho clauses would be to produce a change in the law referring to the descent of real estate. The lion, members who immediately preceded him seemed to have misapprehended tile object of the Bill. He would ask what would be the effect of real estate being regarded as personal, but to provide for the division of real property as ii it were personal property : so that in the case of persons dying intestate all their property should be fairly and equally divided amongst their children. The Hon. the PRESIDENT said if the Bill were carried in its present form the Crown would have no lreehold estates to grant. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE said, in order to contine the action of the Bill to the purpose for which he intended it, he would introduce a clause to provide against its aflecting real property in any other way. He was free to confess that circumstances had recently come to his knowledge, as one of the Real Property Commissioners, which showed him tile importance of the proposed alterations, li' the Council would consent to pass the second reading of the Bill he would pledge himself to alter the clauses before the Bill was taken into Committee, so that they should correspond with the title of the Bill. The motion was then put and carried. The Bill was read a second time, and ils consideration in Committee made an Order of the Day for Tuesday, .1 uly 2. The non. the PRESIDENT said the lion, member would, perhaps, excuse him for making one other remark. If that Bill were passed there could be uo Real Property Act. (Laughter.) DRAFT STANDING, ORDERS. In Committee. Clauses G1 and C2 passed as printed. Clause 63, referring to contempt. The Hon. J. II. BARROW said, with reference to that and the two following clauses, the whole question involved seemed to be dealt with in clauses 101 to 19G, which therefore rendered the present clause unnecessary. He would move that that clause be struck out. Struck out. Clauses 61 and 65 were also struck out. Clauses 66 to 74 passed as priuted. Clause 75, members and olhsrs guilty of contempt to bs committed to custody. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE asked if the Council had power to carry out that clause. The Hon. O. G. EVERARD asked if others than members could be committed. The CHAIRMAN said special powers were provided in the Privilege Act. Clause 76, fees payable on commitment. The lion. J. II. BARROW said, the pains and penalties were tremendous, and he thought could hardly be carried out : 50i. for arrest, 50/. lor commitment, and 51. 5s. tor each day's sustenance, and no bill of fare attached. (Laughter.) Such penalties struck one with terror ; clause 18G seemed also to refer to the same question as 70. The Hon. H. AYEItS would suggest the insertion of the words " not exceeding so/. ;" he thought 70 and 19Â« referred to two different cases, but agreed with the lion, member that the penalties were too heavy and should be reduced. The Hon. G. 31. WATERHOUSE thought one guinea a day would be enough for sustenance, and he knew of only one sale place of confinement, the gaol; and he thought the dietary scale there would not warrant a higher charge. t laufhter. ) The Hon J II BARROW Â«ni when Smith O Brien was arrested he was committed to the cell ir of th Tou^e, that was a far better place th m the gaol ( Laugh tir ) He would propose that 5/ J" be struck out ant il H be umrtiJ Carried Clause 77, "adjournment waa passed, with a vet bal amendment Clauses 78 to 80 paÂ»sed as printed Clause st pissed with a verbal imuidment Clauses 82 an I 83 passed ns printed Clause 84, passed with a Mrbalameiidtnet t Clause 85, passed aÂ» printed Clauses 86 to 89 parsed as punted Claases The Council then ieÂ«umed the CH VlifWAN reported progress, and obt mid lewi to iit agun on the following luesday STEVM POS 1 AL SERVICE The Hon tin < HlLr SICRLlAltl sud with reference to the wish or the lion G 31 Witerli0u*e, tint the Govern- ment should get an ixpri^ion of opinion ii oin the Council on the subject ol ate mi portal communication , he would, with the p rmisÂ«ion of tin House gue nona ot motion on the sulject The standing Orders oeing sii"pÂ«nded, the Hon the Chief Secretary gave notice accordingly ADJOLRNHI M On the motion of the lion thcCHIEr SECRET YR\, the Council adjourned at 10 minutes past 3 until 2 o'clock on Tuesday, June 25 HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.

A. BLYTH, pursuant to notice, asked the lion, the Trea- surer, whether the .Government intend to propose a vote for 2,000/. this year, or for any less sum, towards defraying the expense of the survey of the coast of South Australia ; and also, what steps the Government, intend to take to provide for a similar vote each year until such survey is completed ? He had taken it for granted that, a sum of money would have been placed on the Estimates for the purpose. It had been understood that the Governments of the several colonies would give something towards the object, and ;he wished now to know what action the Government intended to take in the matter. The TREASURER said he was unable, at present, to give any definite information on the subject ; but he might state that it was the intention of the Government to place a sum of money on the Estimates for the purpose. (Hear.) TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY OF THE EASTERN PLAINS. Mr. DUFFIELD, pursuant to notice, moved - "That this House will on Wednesday, June 19, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole for the purpose of con - sideriug the motion-'That an Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, praying His Excellency to cause immediate steps to be taken for the trigonometrical survey of the country known as the Eastern PlaÃ±Ã­s.' " He did not apprehend that any opposition would be offered to the motion; and he would not, therefore, trouble the House with any remarks on that occasion. The motion was agreed to. GOLDSWORTHY'3 .MINERAL LEASE. j 3!r. DUTTON asked the lion. Commissioner of Crown Lands-l. Whether the Government have included in Golds worthy's Mineral Lease, claim No. 2u t, the Goverment road (loo feet wide) between the eastern boundary of sections Nos. 1 and 2. at Black Point, and the sea-beach ? Aud 2. Will the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigra- tion lay on the table of this House a copy of the Land Grant issued to the purchasers of sections Nos. 1 and 2? He said that in explanation of the two questions, he would refer lion, members to the map marked Xo. 42. lion, members would perceive that no road was marked on the map; and as the omission was one of considerable importance to the landholders in the district, he had placed these questions on the notice paper. (Ilear.) The COMMISSIONER OF CROWN LANDS said that if the lion, member wished to take the sense of the House on the policy adopted by the Government in this matter, every facility should be afforded him to do so. The lion, member har, referred to the map 3Ir. DUTTON rose to order. Ile had asked the lion. Com- missioner of Crown Lauds two plain qucstious, and lie apprehended that he was entitled to direct answers. The lion. Commissioner was, however, evidently about to enter luto the question of the policy of granting Crown leases. (Hear, hear.) The COMMISSIONER OF CROWN LANDS said, as the lion, member objected to hear the explanation he had intended to offer, he would at once answer the questions. To the first he would say no lease of the land in question has been issued to Mr. Goldsworthy-fhear, hear)-and to the second he must reply that ho would be unable to lay a capy of the Crown grant on the table, as there was no copy of the grant in the Survey Office. 3IERCANTILE LAW A31ENDMENT BILL. On the Order ol' the Day for the second reading of the 3It-rcantile baw Amendment Bill, The TREASURER said, that in consequence of the recent ruling of the lion, the Speaker willi reference to that Bill, he was convinced that some oilier course must be adopted. He would therefore move that the order be then read and discharged. The order was read and discharged accordingly. ESTIMATES. The TREASURER moved that the Speaker do leave the chair. The motion was carried, and the House went into Com- mittee of the whole for the further consideration of Ways and Means. I Jlr. 3IAGAREY wished to offer some remarks Â«non the j financial policy of the Government. He would in the first ! place allude to the question of allowing newspapers to be transmitted by post without charge. That was in his opinion a subject of considerable importance. There was no doubt but that in determining the establishment of post oftiees in the country districts, the Government were in- fluenced by the fact that, such offices were or were not self supporting. To a certain extent their being not self-sup- porting, arose from the free transmission of newspapers, and it was therefore a matter of consideration whether, so long as they continued to carry the newspapers for nothing, tiley were not in effect depriving some of the country districts of thcprivileges of direct postal communication. Ile contended that there was no reason why such should be I he case, or why the newspapers should not be charged with the cost of transmission. Hon. members had no'doubt read au ni- tii-le on this subject which had appeared iu the Advertiser, in which particular allusion was made to the views enunciated by the lion, member for East Torrens (3Ir. N. Blyth). It was said the lion, member wished to impose a new tax on knowledge, but he (Sir. 3Iagarey) had not so understood the lion, member. If a stamp duty was imposed upon news- papers lor postal purposes, he should not, and he appre- hended the lion, member for East Torrens would not, regard it as a tax at all, but simply as a fair charge for transmission by post. It was impossible to foretell what would be the ultimate expense to the colony of this free transmission when, as two or three years hence would probublv be the case, the circulation ol' the newspapers was greatly extended, and ho contended it was not just to the public to subject the reveuue to such ii serious burden as this might become. It was stated in the article he had alluded I to that the tax, if imposed, would fall upon those who re- ceived the newspapers, and not upon the proprietors. That declaration reduced the matter from a question affecting in- dividuals only to one allecfing the public generally-, but as such he would oppose the continual Â¡on of the present sys- tem. It was said that the newspaper press was a great organ of education. (Hear, hear.) Well, he would admit that it was, but it had been already established in that House that the Government of the day, so long as they subsidized education, could control it. (Loud laughter.) if, then, the Government, were to sub- sidise the press, by allowing free postal transmission, ought they nat also have control tlierc-(oh)-and to determine which newspaper should be eutille I to the privilege, and whichshould not. What, then, would become of the boasted liberty of the press'/ (Laughter.) Auothar argument in favour of the present system was, that the uewspapars inserted the Government advertisements without charge. It had becu asserted on a former occasion (he believed by the lion, member, 3Ir. Hanson; that the existing system was the result of a compromise between tha Government and the press, by which the Government were to give free postal transmission to the newspapers, and the newspapers in return were to insert the Government advertisements without charge. That, in his opinion, was decidedly wrong. (Hear.) The newspapers should pay, and the Government should pay. (Hear, hear. But, he observed, that the compact was already departed from, if compact it was, inasmuch as the Government had placed on the present Estimates the sum of 350/. for advertising Crown lands for sale, ile hailed that resolve as a wise one, and he would heartily support the Government in their proposition to pay for the advertisements it was lound necessary to publish. All such advertisements ought tobe paid for-(hear)-and the free transmission of newspapers should be at once dis- continued. Then it would be possible to ascertain the exact utility and prout of the post-oflice as an institution of the State ; the country post-ofÃ®ices would be placed on a more equitable basis, and justice would be done to all classes, instead as at present of a favor being extended to one class of the communitv at the expense of another that; could least afford it. He would now pass to the question of ad valorem duties. He regretted to lind the lion. Treasurer was not prepared to bring down u re-adjusted scheme for the imposition of these duties. (Hear, hear.j He hoped the lion, member who said "hear, hear" would continue to raise his voice against that change in the fiscal policy of the colony by which the ad valorem duties had been abolished-a change which had not been desired by the public, which had not been desired by that House, which had not been desired by any poition of the community, and which had not even been desired by the Go- vernment of which the lion. Treasurer was a member. (Cries of "no, no.") The lion. Treasurer had told them that the change was generally accepted as a wise and beneficial one; but he, Mr. Magarey, was compelled to assert that lie had not yet met with a single convert to it. (Oh, oh.) Well, perhaps, hu might make an execution in favor of the Eastern District. ' He believed the people of that district were willing enough lo get their tea as cheap as possible, although they were extremely averse to paying any increased charges upou their spirits and tobacco. (Laughter.) The lion Treasurer had, however, confessed that the mercan- tile community were opposed to this change. The TREASURER was sorry to interrupt the lion, mem- ber, but. he did so only to correct him on the point. His statement waa that the iuioorters-not the mercantile com- munity-were opposed to the change. Mr MAGAREY had imagined he was correct in speaking of the Ã­nipoiters as the metcaulile eominnmty (Hear ) The lieaaurer hid stated m lui opening speech as au argument in favor of Ins sy-tem, that no smuggling was being carried on although it hld been anticipated the abolition of the ad valorem d ities vould encourage tint practice Non, he would like to know upon what authority *he Treasurer a'hrmed that no smuggling was bÃ¡ing earned on Of course, the Collector of Customs would not confess to a knowledge ot the practice, and in the absence of any suras ol' conscience money being pji>l into the Treasury, he supposed the I reasuier had arrived at the coneluÂ«ion"he had so confidently stated (Laughter) Locking, ho>vever, to the increa e01 population m some districts ot the colony, and to the fact that the duties pud on spii.ts and tobacco had not propor- tionately increased, he could not escape the conviction th it smugging w is being eirned on to a lar^e extent, and therefore that it would be well if the lrtasmer would prepue to reduce at least the duties on tobacco He fully agree 1 with the rcniuks that ha 1 been made on i pre\ Ã­ous occ iÂ«ion bv the lion member tor Last loriens respecting the city police He thought that one half of the cost of mintmning thecitypol.ee might be fairly charged to the country, and the other half to the city As to the question of c h cation he thought its bene tits should be extended, anl that what it waa propo ed to do in the c.ty Â»hould bÂ«done also in the country df-tncts ile trusted the treasurer would gue Ins ittention to the subjeet, aiid see it it was not possible to eilend more of the ulv tntages ot education to the country distuctÂ« (Hear, hen ) Before sitting dowu he wished to say i lew woids respecting the question ol immigration Ho saw no necessity for the lonawai ot the giaut lor the puipo->c of bunging free immigrants to the colony Ile Ird seen no Â«uch neces-uty lui many years pist and he thought aui li u eccs*itj would not ai iÂ«,- Â«ig un in tue lutine history of this coÂ¡< iiy Even now the colon/ was not deriving any advantagefrom the mo"ey alieady expended tor assisted immigration He foi one doubted w hethei, e\ en if no monty had been cvci voted for the puipo-e the ti lo <1 lmmigialion to this colony would no., have flowed as fast Hie Gerin in popula'ion well knowing the) coul I receive no .iÂ«3Â¡Â«tanec lro ii the btate had continued to bring out their lrienls to tho colony uni others he doubted not v.ould do the same Why, lit the Government boldly declare that no more money would be expended to piomote assisted itnini I gration, uid he wrs couviuetu that as miiiy immigrants would come here a=sisted by their friends us would be other Hl^eaSaHed by tuebtite.

If lion, members would examine the speech of the lion, member, they would find that the revenue during the first two quarters of the year had been really in a painful positon (olij- andthattheGovernnieui. had actually been bound to force large quantities ol' land into the market in order to enable the Treasurer t ) meet the House, and 74,ooo/. it was expected would be obtained from land sales tiiis quarter in consequence of forcing the land into the market in this most indiscreet manner. And now about the Esti- mates. He found that the lion, member never had sepa- rated the land lund from the general revenue in making up his Estimates. (Hear, hear.) This would, he imagined, be a icaiarkably simple mutter, as it only involved the prepara- tion of two returns of revenue instead of one. (Hear.) It had been a plan which was adopted previously in the old Parliament, when the Treasurer of the day always used to place on the table of the II. use a return showing the revenue derived from Crown lands alone. And here he might remark, that he had listened to the speech of the hon. member for Onkaparinga (Mr. Milne) with a great deal ol' pleasure, and that he agreed with every ligure which had been brought forward by the lion, member, and with every statement made by him. The Treasurer had said that the land lund was not enough to pay the expenses, but all that the Treasurer had taken into account was the 1/50,000/. which he derived from the sale of lands ; but then, as the bon. member for Onkaparinga had very clearly shown, there were the amounts from rents, assessments, and other sources, to be added to this, winch brought up the total revenue derived from the lands to pretty nearly 310,000/. [Hear, hear.] Ile agreed with the revenue estimated by the'treasurer in many points. [Hear, hear.] He believed that the Government would receive,:Â« anticipated, 150,00 /. from the lands, although it was pro- bable that the recent fall in wool might in some respects act against them, as preventing the squatters trom eomingso freely info the markct~[laughttr]- but seeing the extraordi- nary character of the events vv Inch had transpired, he was in- clined to believe it posr-ible even that more might be realised from leases and assessments, and also from Crown lands, than was anticipated. [Hear, hear.] A reaction would, however, inevitably take place as regarded the first item, and. although a great many of these sections might be taken up at -t /. >i piece, at present there was little hope of their being similarly taken up next year. (Laughter and hear.,) He had said last year that the Treasurer would not derive Â¿30,ooo/. from customs. He had prognosticated this much, and for these reasons. Ile was trying to roalisi his customs from entirely the wrong class of articles. He was trying to get his duties from the very class of articles which the best patriot among them would wish that they should be reduced. Had the 'Treasurer kept up the ad valorem duties he would, no doubt, have realised the amount anticipated, but he had not done so. (Hear, hear.) What would Hie lion, gentleman do if he went to one of his teetotal meetings and told them he was anxious to raise his revenue from the articles he was now trying to raise that revenue upon? Why, they would pooh pooh the bon. member "off the plat form if he attempted to do so. (Laughter. The lion, member had stated that the average customs revenue during the last three years had been l-.is.oooZ., but it they would take the average of the past year they would lind that the revenue only amounted to llt.ooj. per annum. The lion, member had then observed that although double duties had been imposed upon these articles, the revenue had not decreased. He thought that a particulaiiv happy state- ment to come from the Treasurer, especially when the increase in population was also considered. The lion, member had also referred to the fact of his revenue from this source being reduced in consequence of the repa) ment of the ad va'orem duties. 5,ono/. certainly bad been paid back on account of these duties, but the Treasurer could not take credit, for the whole of that amount, inasmuch as lie was receiving the double duties for the first 17 days at all events Ot the financial yeir (Heir
