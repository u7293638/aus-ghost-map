THE MELBOURNE GHOST SCARE. WIDESPREAD TERROR. [From the Melbourne Age of July 31.] Of course so one believe in ghosts. In Australian surroundings the suggestion of such phenomena seems absurd, because with- out the assistance of old graveyards or romantic ruins with associations of mysterious crime, a disembodied spirit finds itself too much alone in the world to impress the public with a due sense of awe. yet, in spite of uncon- genial circumstances, there is no gainsaying the fact that the existence of ghosts is nightly suddenly revealed to unsuspecting wayfarers in dark quarters of the metropolis and as rapidly withdrawn. The intangibility of these apparitions alone assists the notion that they might be supernatural. If they loitered for a moment they could be tested at the throat, on the nose, in the eye, at the point of the jaw, below the belt, or a posteriori, and their mortality instantly determined upon beyond a doubt. As they pursue the Fabian policy of judicious retreat, however, their victims "shy" and failing to find anything to investigate on recovery are quite nonplussed. Talk eventuates. The tale of the three black crows applies to ghost stories, and then any suburb without a wraith is held to be behind the times. Very soon after the South Melbourne "spook"- a commonplace electric light illusion- had been exploded there were rumours of the appearance at South Yarra of an uncanny looking goblin man dressed in a soft black hat and a huge overcoat of the same colour who hung about sombre parts of unfrequented streets, and had the Christian-like habit of following young ladies home. One of the victims said after leaving some friends one evening she noticed this figure on the other side of the street, but could not see its face. It walked if she walked. If she stopped, it stopped. Having occasion to use her handkerchief, it did likewise. Finally it ran in front of her, threw open the great coat it wore, and exhibited the words, "Prepare to Meet Thy Doom" in luminous paint. She screamed, and it disappeared. A week or so later, about half past 1, on a bleak, dark morning, Constable 3594, on duty near the Sarah Sands Hotel, Brunswick, met the town lamplighter careering towards him in a breathless condition, pale and perspiring. This man, a tall, strong young fellow about 25 years of age, named Bate, explained that he had "seen a ghost." Bate lives at West Brunswick, where the settlement is merging into the open country. His story is that on his way along Fleming-street, which practically runs between two fenced paddocks, pursuing his nocturnal duty of turning out the lights, when nearing the corner of Park street, "a black cloud suddenly presented itself in front of him and whisked past his side with a swish. He turned to look behind, feeling a little startled, and saw it rapidly receding in his wake. Although it seemed shapeless, he concluded it must be a bicyclist, without a light, and yelled after him, "All right Spider, good night." Then he tramped on with his lamp stick, thinking idly of good ness knows what-the love or the ambition of a lamplighter- and keeping close to a fence. a^B^B^B^B^^B^BM^C^lV''M^B? ?l^klv^B^^^B^B^Ba?^B^B^ft^tfl^l^B^B^BA. b^b^l^b^b^bU'^b? >^^bS i!b2s^s J^\a^^^2 Ai aTaTaTaWtJto .aTafe arf a^B^B^a^b^Bt^^B^aA fa?^B^^MaV A^bW bVA. ?Ss^cj9?x^tr???ti?m?
