ALIVE IN A DEAD-HOUSE. The San Francisco Alta California gives an account of the experience of a German who was supposed to have died in that city, and whose body was immediately removed and placed in the dead-house attached to the hospital in which he had been under treatment : â€” " The body was deposited in a ca-e where two other bodies had already been placed, and between them. The cover was pat on, and the keeper of the dead- house retired for the night. Abhut midnight a loud screaming and yelling of the most unearthly character was heard in the dead- house. The keeper of the dead-house was sought after,, but being aware of what he was required to do, he sought concealment, preferring to let the ghosts fight it out amongst themselves rather than attempt to become a peacemaker. When, at last, he was prevailed upon to proceed to the dead-house and open the door, the ghoBtly form . of the German, whose life had been, a few hours previously, pronounced extinct, and who had been dressed in the robes of the dead, stood before him. The keeper fainted outright, while the terrified Q-erman rushed headlong through the long halls and corridors of the building, spreading dismay and terror as he went." Some, more courageous than the rest, caught and arrested him in his frantic career, but, the next instant, the poor German fell on the floor in a fit. The physician was sent for, and restoratives UBed, by which, he was restored to consciousness.
