I remember one .ex- ceptional i week when the1 mercury never went down to lOOdeg., even at night; and we had three days which were almost unbearable. The wind resembled a blast from a furnace. That was . a number of years back. Lately we have been blessed with comparatively cool summers. It will be cooler ? presently ; there is a storm coming. Where is your uncle ?" ' He is in the hammock, in a state of collapse.

On : the east, lay. .an-< angry looking bank of black clouds, through which; every now: i and ¡ then . vivid : streaks of lightningf;- flashed.! ÍÜ ; A peculiar stillness . reigned,: broken only by the rumble of . the thunder.! ¡ " Allan," called a feeble voice from the hammock, " how do you liko an Australian summer day ?'; ¡> ¡ . . n . "J have ' felt hoarse," ! I' replied laughing.' -::<;i a , -,,;:r\¡. vu .' ; >.. "Better too, I hope." ..<; . -. nr. " Oh, decidedly-aunt ! come i andi watch the storm, it is just breaking.',' ' Aunt joined me, and I could not but realise, how close we were to the tropics. , An hour ago tho sky was clear. Now it was almost covered by clouds, and the sun, which had been so powerful, was quite obscured. ' In ten minutes the rain poured down gave place to a severe hailstorm Í)oure.d again in torrents,:whilst the ightning » flashed and the thunder roared,, and . at the end of - another hour, the only remaining evidencesbf the warring, elements, were a sheet of water in the , garden, and a cora iplete change in, the temperature, which was now beautifully cool and refreshing. ¡ " Allan, said my aunt, ," I wish you would set up a practice in Graf- ton. - Ever since you decided to come to the colonies, I have, been in hope you would settle near us." ¡ ? ¡"There aro already more; medical men. than are required. I am afraid I could not be contented with a ; fifth share in such a remarkable i healthy locality, aunt," I replied laughing. " They all-seem to do well, Allan." : "¡Yes?

'.

" No, except from a social point of view, I prefer living here. We have nice neighbours, and are expecting quite a gay time during the holidays. First ot all, on Christmas eve there is to be a party at Mrs. Morris's. On Boxing day our picnic to the Pin- nacle ; on New Year's day a regatta, and several other picnics and parties following, so you are not going tb bo ', allowed to grow melancholy for lack of amusement." After dinner my uncle, with re- newed energy, took up his pet argu- ment, and I was a listener until bed- time. He talked well on political subjects, his freetrade utterances being most convincing to one who had never studied the pros and cons of either question. For several days the weather was cool, and I thoroughly enjoyed the excursions we took here and there,' and liking the district, the idea of settling on the Clarence recurrèd to me more than once. Mrs. Morris's party was a great success, and there I made several agreeable friends, among others an especial favorite of my Aunt's, Miss Merton being quite unlike the girls' I had known at home ; nevertheless equally charming and womanly. I think it was her half saucy indepen- dence that struck me. In mention- ing her to my Aunt next morning^,' I remarked that she was anticipating a good time on the day of the picnic. " To-morrow," said my aunt, " you will also like her cousin Amy, but I shall not venture to say you will admiro Percy. He is one of my pet aversions. They were not at Mrs. Morris's last night. Amy has been at Yamba for a month, and only came up the river yesterday.". '- . We spent Christmas afternoon' on the river, going back in imagination .to tliei days when I was a little lad, remiriiscens-| ing over' many little mishaps "which oc- curred upon different occasions1 in the clear stream of dear old Devon: ' ' . 'How long ago it seems,' said ' Aunt, with a sigh.- " ' ''' ' ' ' '* ""y ? ' L.et us change the subject,' said Uncle.; ,' I'm getting home sick.' ' ; ; ! , ' ''^ : . ' Home, home, sweet, sweet' home,' I sang unconsciously. ?'? ¡I . . You are not beginning to wish for home yet, are you, Allan .?*?? asked Aunt." . > ; «I? Indeed,no.; I came out here with the intention of remaining,' I replied; 1 ' > j i .' The shadows are getting long,'remarked Aunt. .' It must be time we.turned home-: ward.' .. ,,.?!.?;;.;,;.'. The next morning rose < bright and fair, and soon after 9 o'clock buggy .after buggy, crowded with happy looking .people, bent upon ah : enjoyable ¡day, drove; up. i; Al- though an early start was made, . the ; sun, was very hot. before.we reached the Pin- nacle, and everybody was glad to get into the shade. , .. . . ¡ ; ,, ; .?<, \ i 'Dr. Lester,' cried Miss Merton, gaily, ,' In case of snake-bite, I hope, you did not neglect.. bringing. a plentiful supply* ¡of strychnine.' ... . ¡' ; J .Do you anticipate that it will .be re- quired, Miss Merton ?' I replied.,i . ,: .'Well, you know it maybe, and it is wise to be prepared for an emergency.' !1 Her cousin, Amy Merton, was a .tall,, fair-girl, with beautiful. blue eyes, and a calmly dignified manner. . She was not a great talker, : but I found she could; be deeply in,earnest when the subject inter-, rested her. , In Percy Merton I met with1 an ? antagonistic spirit; From our intro- duction I disliked him, and his languidly insolent ¡ manner showed- that he did not , entertain any ; kindlier feel- ing, for me.: There was a great deal, of chatter : over the unpacking of hampers, and, listening, I could not but be amused at the sharp retorts of a rather masculine girl named Minnie Hordern, ' a brunette with very dark eyebrows and dazzlingly white teeth. . She was decidedly original, in her remarks, but evidently not altogether a favourite on account of her plain speak- ing. , Miss Epsom ; was the beauty of our party. , Seldom had I seen so expressive a; face. She reminded me of a picture I had once seen of Queen Esther. ; Aside from her personal appearance, there was nothing, I remarkable about her. ! After , luncheon the picnickers amused themselves in various manners, whilst I, feeling tired ? of the heat and laughter, strolled off in a most unsociable mood, and, finding an. invitingly cool retreat, threw myself down and almost fell, asleep. I must have been there quite three quarters of an hour; when I heard my, uncle's voice calling : . ?' Allan I Cooee ! Allan, ? where are ¡you ?. . . . . . Springing up quickly, I hurried in his direction. ' What has happened ?' I asked in alarm. ' Miss Amy. Merton has hurt her foot,'' he answered, . Come and do what you can for her now, and we shall, be obliged to take her back to;our house immediately. She is suffering a good deal of pain, and her ankle1 is very much swollen already.' . > . How did she hurt it ?' I asked as we hastened back to the camping, place. ' Slipped on one of the rocks.' ! After bandaging the injured member which was severely sprained, I .offered to drive the buggy back to Mountain View. Percy Merton standing by with an ag- grieved expression, curtly informed me that his cousin was quite able to return to Grafton, and he was waiting, to attend her..:- .. . . . ' . i .. .' ' I . beg . your pardon 1' I said . firmly, ' Miss Merton is suffering more pain than you imagine, and would not be equal to such a long drive' He was about to reply when Miss Amy interrupted him.. ' Be kind. enough. to let me decide, Percy. Mrs. Lester, could I not return to Mountain View with my cousin without troubling any one else ?' i ' I should prefer returning with you, j dear, and it - will be necessary for my nephew to come also, as your foot will I require ' attention, immediately. Mrs. Morris will take my place, and now Mr. Merton', will you bring your buggy; there is room for. all four of us.'? : Percy Merton complied with an' ill grace,'murmuring to my surprise and-Miss Amy's evident annoyance,' ' something which'sounded very like 'What an un- necessary fuss I' " ; By the' time we reached home ? Miss Amy's endurance was severely tried, and it was in a half-unconscious condition that she', was borne into the house. Her cousin ' very sympathetically remarked that ? * Amy always managed to ' get into difficulties.' ' I thought cold applications were ? the proper means of restoring circulation,' said Percy Merton. ? - ' They appear to me improper and in- jurious,' I returned shortly. Before the pic-nickers returned Miss Amy was easier, and by io o'clock she was sleeping peacefully. For several days the-ankle was-ex- tremely painful, but it sooa began to im prove, and,' by New,, Year's day bur patient was anxious to test' its strength. > She was obliged to be contented by a promise ' that she should walk in the gardent-in another week... Mr. Merton and . other friends, came every few days to see her, and we all conspired to make the time pass as agreeably as possible. ?.' '."?'- ?i ! '? ' . I do not remember hearing of . her meeting with an accident in all the time?' I: have known her,' said'my aunt,' coldly j - ^ « ' This is the second time she has' sprained her foot,'he complained." . ' It is probably still weak then,' I re- . marked. ' Aunt, have you any.laudanum ?'¡ And whilst I removed the bandages we i had improvised, she went in search of it.;' The joint had become so > inflamed that'' leeches were required, but we were obliged [. to do ¡without, them, and, had no other*' recourse but the application of volatile ' liniment, mixed with laudanum. I also: administered a dose of 'the latter; û-u ¡ni. ; Much to my secret'satisfaction it rained ! on New Year's Day. I had been ex- pected to attend the regatta with ' my uncle, and had anticipated a long, tire-'' some day, instead pf which I ' was: re- quired by my áunt to amuse Miss- Amy,,' while she helped uncle in the library to unpack and arrange a case of new books. After a long discussion upon the merits pf " different new publications, we drifted into a conversation of a more personal natur,a\ I found that Miss Amy was ân orphan. > her widowed mother having died-little more than a year previously ; since which' time she' had lived with her aunt''and'; cousins at Grafton. Her father had been'-' ,a squatter in Queensland, where her life,''', up to the time of her mother's death, had ; 'been ' passed. : Her ' cousin ? Percy, who1 '? was yet another aunt's child, still managed'1 the stations in her interest, being now on a three . months visit ?' with his relatives. ??'

A long ; outbreak;a of;a: . fever kept me busy from -, morning ¡¡ tilhit night. One evening, after a busy day, as.ir I sat in my study window in the dusk Torie a few. minutes rest, the loneliness of. my n life came painfully to my mind, and I could not -but recognise with what a small amount of interest ..I; went, through my; day's work. After all, I thought per haps.I have mistaken my vocation. Surely there are other walks in life which are less dreary, , I have half a mind, to throw up my practice and return to.dear old Devon. Looking out of the window I caught a flicher of dusky red, the merest ghost ol a sunset/ which has room to spread, and be beautiful to its last lingering afterglow. Around-me the dusty roofs shut out the air, and. I , felt stifling. . A bell., rang, and . soon, a servant appeared, carrying on a tray 'a card. Absently I took it from him, and read my.uncle's name. 'Hurrah!' I shouted, and in less, than a minute I was shaking him bj' the hand, with the liveliest feeling of pleasure I hád known for many a day. .. \- ? '..You 'are not looking .well, Allan !' he said, after answering a dozen questions. _". '. Overworked,'. I replied, trenchantly.
