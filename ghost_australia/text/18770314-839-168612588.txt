A gala night. m tho dear, old rectory, far, far away ; tho' schoolfellows thnt he has been permitted to invite are all there ; tho mistlotoo hangs in the. ivy-covered porch ; he placed it there, and conceals , himself so as to ake advantage of tho first who oomes beneath, if alovoly girl with long rippling golden hair, laughing merrily, (how distinctly Mio can hear, it) ° comes tripping ir1. -,With pager , oye^.he watohos her ; ? n rcimito more she is .beneath the mistlotoo— ono spring,; his arm; is. around her waist and tho merry Christmas, .tribute .paid.
