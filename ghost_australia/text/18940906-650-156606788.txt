About fifty-five couples attended, a largo ' percentage of them being in costumes of rl 1 fFoVrtn f A Â» 1 A ? t Miss Maude Twiss looked perfection. Miss Baker, as 'Queen of Hearts,' was greatly admired. Miss L. Edwards was nicely dressed as ' Nancy Lee.' Miss - Delaney also looked well as a ' Red Cross Nurse.'

Miss Reimer, as ' Spring,' wore a pretty costume, and there were several others whose names I could not got. Amongst the gentlemen Mr. P. O'Meara in a Spanish costume looked immense ; Mr. Harry Sullivan, ss tho ' Count de Breton,' and Mr. M. Murray as ' King Charles ' were, perhaps, tho most extraordinary male costumes in the room ; Mr. J.
