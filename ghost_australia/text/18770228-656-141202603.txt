. UNDER THE SEA. / Thet were Borambling down the rocks, a gay, , ohatteririg; procession— pretty .. Kate with her captain ; Dr. Gray supporting his invalid wife ; Helen, Isabel, Tom, arid their midshipman cousin; last o( all, Esther Vane- Calorie. . It , seemed to/ her morbid, fancy' right that it should be so. . Hence forth' Bhe tnust be alone — always. j ' The'little guide trotted on, in advanoe— his round, tea-year-old face, wearing , the .vacant look so, strangely . common , to ? that part of the Main coaat, with its . glorious aoenery., .There the. ocean is . considered siiri'ply a yaat depit of herringa and porgy oil, arid the mountains -aa/ untoward obstacles., in -the ..way of. a primitive husbandry;; : ' Blast the'rn, I: wish they was flat,' the ' natives say, as their, ploughs encounter the boulders at the base ; . and, if they look, aloft : at all, it is to calculate the parches of the medder-land ' which might be made i to r occupy the same area, if :the heights were out of the way. . i1' . : : . Our party felt on the eve of great things. . Having arrived' only the day before, ? Mount Newport, ? with its 'wonderful -«aoh' !of sapphire sea; the bluffs,- the lakes iri their aettings of dark blue hill, were Btill to them imageB of things not eeen. This, their first axoursion,' they ' had 'dedicated to ' the 'Grotto,' or '.Devil's Oven,' as the; const people call it; a sort of submarine ' ca,vo, unveiled and acoessable at - low tide only, ?and a great wonder in' its way.' The path grew steeper. ' Carefully/they follo'wea its windings, step by step,' sure-footed Eat* aco^iting tho, help she didn't need/for that :pIeasuro'iri being guided and watched. Arid no w the little guide pausos/ arid with' a freckled forefinger ,'poirits rourid a projec 'tion'of r66k/l;-AU!bro^d to', the qibt. ' ' AH 1 ,th«ra it is— th« caro of the mermaids, . i; A shriek of mingled surprise and enchant-; ment burst from ? tho party at tbe sight/ Beneath the low-browed arch the rocky; floor roso,. terrace above terrace, till in its highest recess it met the roof above. A' floor for the nereids to dance npon ; a floor of pink coral-line, gleaming here and there through pools of emerald water left by the retreating: tide.' : And caoh of these tiny lakelets seemed briming with flowers — the flowers of: tho ocean — green whorls, like chestnut burrs ; anemones with their dahlia bloom; brown and rosy mosses, among whose , tendrils bright fish darted and played, and snails ot vivid orange .' colour clustered; .broad -leaves o! brilliant dye swaying and undulating with the 'motion . of the pool-f-minute specks of life bathing every irridescent hue '; earthly garden was . never so ? gorgeouB. Tho : rocky .shelves were dimplfid with hollows — softly, exqui sitely carved. '. No. fancy of the old classic days seemed too fantastic or too. fair for the spot. : The . imagination instinctively kindled 'into pictures, and saw .the se$ nymphs sporting in.the foam'; bold tritons winding, their shellB; mermaids , playing at hide-and-seek; nixies and mocking water sprites peeping from tbe baaino-r-all dream land and wonderland opening, and thb common earth put aside ajid far away, v j : With cries of delight the' party -made their way. down, and: scattered through the cave. . There waB room for an army. It was hard to realise that with the returning tide the apace must fill, the gateway close, and leave no resting-place for human foot.

'Then we' can Btayas long asiwe like; : Oh! : do some body, come here and see this,' : ' j She , was : lying with her face' almost touohing the anemones. .Nobody responded to- her call, eaob had found some 'other point of interest. Tom had fished* up ,a; eea- urchin,' and was exhibiting it. . Kate arid the captain; in a niche of their own, at a safe whispering distarice, were absorbed in eaoh other. ;- Esther had climbed to the topmost ledge, and was sitting there alone. For the first time in six weary months, !a' sensation of pleasure had come to her ; she was conscious of but one longing—that they j .would all-go away and leave.her .to realise it;; :;With- some .vague hope she got out her : colour-box ' arid : : portfolio, andi began : to' sketch.' Sketching;! she - had i discovered, had kept people off, and furnished an excuse for silence.: 'And so an hour or. Bo passed by;. She heard, as in a dream, 'the: chatter of ' thp others, their questions' to the little' guide, his short,, jerky replies. ''. The. pools were all explored; the urchins andanemosss' had been tickled, with' parasols, and made to shut and open arid shut again ; : the : young people began to sigh for future , worlds- to conquer; and Mrs. Gray: to consider it very, damp.

There waa some thing in the very nature of her trial which, .made, it necessary to veil her grief,, with: reserve. A black dress, aha nugnt wear—. Paul was a cousin, ?. and some show of mourning ia allowed foraecond couainhood, even,! ana for . intimate, friendship suoh as: theirs had been. ; But no one knew of the unavowed engagement , whioh , bound therii since that hurried farewell letter in which love - found utteranoe, and . which .only reached her aftar ho sailed— the : sailing from which there, was; no. return'. .

It would not bear talking about, :sp she. kept ailence, and tried to wear a bravo faoe. . \- Left alone,' Bhe found with oomo surpriie that ahe didn't want to cry. i J All the morn ing she had felt that to: creep 'away Borne where and weep, arid weep; her heart 'out, would be so -good ; but tears are contrary .things.! : She sat there dulled'into a oalm that was almost content. : She was thinking of the time !wheri Paul visited the island and olimbed about that very cave; - On tho vefy rook-shelf where'she aat;' he :riiight perhaps have rested, ahe liked to think so. It brought him hearer. - ' ' ? ' A little. later, ahe'put her sketch away, . and oropt do wn to V broad '' ledge/ where , 1 through th'e'ar-ih, the piqriislte al^-lirio was. ' Tiiible, Th« aurf tumbled aqdohimed lik« distant bells. She lay aa if fascinated, her eyes fixed upon this ahining horizon. Some where far beyond it was the spot which the good ship which held her all went dowri. Down where? Her imagination ran riot. Cleaving the liquid depths to the inmost sanctuary of ocean, she saw the golden aands, the shadowy grean light percolating through miles of water — the everlasting repose which reigned there beyond th« reach of atorm, wind, or hurricane. Sha tried tb fix the wandering images, and to think of it as a haven no lesa tranquil than the quiet mounds under which are pillowed beloved heads on earth. But it would riot stay .Thoughts of tempest and fury, ot ohill piping winds whipping the foaaa froaa the waves, or roar and tumult, and a heav ing wilderness 'of dark' waters, came over her'; arid through all the refrain of Jean Ingelow's pathetic strain mixed'and bland edt i And I shall see thee no more) : , Till the sea gives up its dead.' Great drops forcod themielves beneath the closed eyelids, and she sobbed s ' Oh, Paul, Paul 1 how can I bear it 1' . , And then she thought, aa ahe had thought before, how glad ahe would be to die! Life didn't seem desirable any longer, and it would be blessed to be with Paul, even at the.bottom of the ocean.: And thinking thus, the long eyelashes drooped more and more heavily; -peace fell upon, tho brow and. lips;., she was asleep— asleep. and dreaming a sweet, joyful dreain. How -long sho slept she never knew. She woke with , a sensation of intense cold. The apell o£ slumber was. so Btrong upon her that for a moirient she did not realise what had taken place. . The cave was half full of water. Her feet 'and the hem of her dress were already .wet;. - and .the roar of tho waves beneath the. hardly distinguishable arch way/told that the tide had . surprised another victim, and already the avenue' of escape was. barred. . , . , . Was thia the answer to some unspoken prayer? /''.. . ,- .- ... The/thought flashed. over her. ? Had ahe really prayed for death ? . Here it was, close at hand, and she was conscious of no gladness— only an instinctive desire for life. lt .was too dreadful to be drowned in that hole, and be washed away like.a weed. Life was worth living, after all., , . Hod somebody said, or waa she dreaming, ; that a portion of the cave was left uncovered by! the water ? .. She. could not '-remember, but how she searched about for. some indi cation.., Ah/ surely, this, is' one^-a cork, a scrap of paper, , lodged on, the higher shelf, fragile 'things ; which a .tide must inevitably have washed aw;ay. With that instinot of property which snrvivea shipwreck and fire, 'she . collected .her drawing materials and other little belongings, and retreated with them /to .'.this possible place , of refuge, wrapped her. cloak about her, and : with' folded hands/ sat down to await her fate. ' The cave was.full of pale green light. . It was beautiful tb see, aa the advancing flow rosei ledge over ledge, and flooded the fairy .pools, how! each star:flower and sea-urchin, each crimsori and golden , weed, trembled arid quivered as with 'delight at itsiefresh irig touch. Each anemone throw wide ita potals and ' expanded into full blossom to meet the' apray, baptiam. ; No mortal eye ever looked upon sight more charming ; but ita beauty -was lost to the ahivering and terrified girl. . The doorway had quite, disappeared. Starp spray dashed against her dress. : The drops' stznek. her face. She shrank, and olung more tightly tb. a rock, a prayer rose to her lips'; , and through the .tremulous light' of the sribmerged archway, a strange shadow began to go and come, to ' move and pause, and move again. Was it fish or . was it weed, or some mysterious presence ? i Did it 'come accompanied by life or death ?' ?' ' ' 1 ? , Meantime, on the rocka above, a dis tracted group were collected. The party had come 'gaily back from: the 'Heada.' Dr. Gray, ignorant landsman as he was, had grown uneasy 'arid hurried them away. Arrived at the ' Grotto,' the full extent of the calamity was at once evident. .The boy had miatakeri the tide— flow for ebb— and the only hope was that Esther, discovering her- danger in time, had taken refuge at the pottage near by. / Thither thoy flow ; buti'iis we know, in vain. . . .. ... / ' The sobbing girls hung distractedly over tho'cliff, 'listening to. the hollow boom. with which' tho' waves sijung. in the , cavern beneath^sickeriirig to , think of tha awful something /whioh / mght V any .moment wash outward 'on ! the^^ 'returning billow.

'So they 'waited. !. ' 'A rattle of wheela cairie from the road. They all turned to look, and someone said, 'Perhaps ifa 'a doctor!' Though what earthly uae a doctor could have been, would bo'hardtoBay! ', A figure was coming rapidly up the path — ^a young man. Nobody recognised nim, till'Dr. Gray Btarted forward with tho face of One' who Bees a' ghost. ...... : 'Paul! Good God! It is impossible!' ''Yea, dootor,' with a hasty hand-shake. 'No other. I don't wonder you stare.'. ' But, in ' heaven's . name, how has it come about ? . ; Where have you been since ?we gave 'you up for lost?' 'It's a long story. You. shall hear it soriip day.

Dr;' Gray * spoke : ' ' ' ' Paul, my dear fellow, how can I tell you ! 'Esther is below there.' . ? .' In the Grotto ?' 'In; the Grotto. Can anything bo done?' ' ' The' yourigt man staggered.' The glow faded from his face, leaving him ashy pale. For a moment; he stood irresolute ; then he rouaed himself, and his voice though husky, ;Was firm: ' .V . , . ?

Then to Mr. Gray : 'I shall row out there; opposite tha entrance, and » make a dive for it. , If .1 oome up inside, it's all right, and Pll sae that no harm happens to Esther till the water falls, anA wo. can got her out.'
