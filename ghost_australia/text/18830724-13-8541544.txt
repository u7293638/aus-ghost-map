THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-As an Episcopal conference held at Calcutta in January last, the following letter was addressed in love and humility to all of every race and religion therein The letter is a remarkable one, and is a bold attempt to bring about that "unity " that the church transform her services in the hope that the voice of the Indian bishops may extend beyond India's shores, and find a listening car in these southern lands, I venture to request you kindly to find a place for their letter in your columns. I am, etc., July 13. (Letter of the Indian Bishops ) "We, the Metropolitan and undersigned bishops of the Church of England in this province, address these words to all people, of whatever race, in India and Ceylon " To our own flock, the members of the Church of England, we Bend words of greeting in the Lord, and we bless them in the name of the father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, we assure them of our unceasing prayers for them, and of our desire to minister to them the grace of God, and to labour for their eternal good, and we earnestly entreat them to walk worthy of their calling, that so our Lord may be honoured in their lives, and this purpose accomplished in their salvation, and also that by their example the blessed gospel may be visibly set forth and commended to all, till all be one flock under the One Shepherd "To all who name the name of Christ, though not in the Church of England, we send loving greeting, and pray that grace and peace may be with them, longing exceedingly to extend to them the right hand of fellow- ship, on the basis of Catholic, that is, of primitive and apostolic order "To all those our dear brethren, in the great human family, bound to us by that cup tie which knits man to man, where each may recognise in his brother mar the image of likenesS, however obscured, of the one Almighty and loving Rather, we would address words of warmest love and greeting in Ills name, beseeching them to listen to the message which we bear to them from Him " For we have a message for all Through- out the great scene of 1 admit society, native and European, all is full of interest and inquiry and movement in spiritual things Christians, lovers of Jcsus.andotbersdesiroUB to be loyal to His truth, yet finding themselves divided among a distracting variety of rich gious organisations are looking for a basis of union, and a standard under which they may (other Among the non Christian peoples, the popular superstitions, as they have been held by the uninstructed, ore being displaced, and in movements more or less national the leaders of native thought are seeking to replace what has been outgrown by revival of the ancient spirit or by new speculations "Meanwhile all, whether Christians or not, are children of the One Father, who has but one truth, if only they may learn it and one salvation, if only they may attain it, for all the souls that He has made V he is responsible to Him and to His children here for carrying to them His gift and gathering them round His feet' We thankfully acknowledge the great works of love and power which have been, and are being, carried on in every part of the land by bodies of Christians not of our communion Yet we seem to perceive among these what we ourselves keenly feel, a sense of the loss which all sustained through Separation And we believe that the inheritance of catholic truth and organisation which has come down to our times by means of the Church of England has come down in His providence to our times for the good of all and is especially fitted to meet His purposes for this land " Holding, therefore that inheritance not for ourselves but for all, we accept in the name of the Church of l_i|_!and this great responsibility We offer, in His name a rallying point to Christians and we offer to non Christians access to those gifts of truth and grace, and of the means of cherishing these, with which God has entrusted us for India's state. We do not speak of our selves As persons we are nothing but we humbly dare to speak thus of the great gifts which we are stewards, and which through all the ministrations of the church over which were Bet, is dispensed to Christians "Alike in Calcutta, and in Lahore, in Bombay, Travancore, Ceylon, in Madras, Iib nev elly, and Burmah, we proclaim one body of truth, as we have received it, with the Divine scriptures from which it is derived, handed down through generation after generation of men whose lives it has sanctified And along with this truth, as the divinely appointed security for its con- tinuing unchanged, we hand on, as we have received, the one framework of apostolic organisation which has preserved the truth to our times And we claim therewith to transmit, by the laying on of hands, the authority to preach this one truth and administer the sacraments by which it is applied , as we ourselves have received that authority by laying on of the hands of those before us to whom it had come down from the apostles of Jesus Christ " This truth, thus preserved, administered with this authority, is God's gift to India by by the English church "And we speak, in offerings, withnofaltcr invoices There are differences among the members of our church, as there must be amongst earnest men, but they lie-and this ls why they are so ( easily seen upon the surface, and are insignificant in view of the essential body of truth, which we proclaim with one voice to that unity this, our present utterance, bears witness " The church to which we invite all is one church for European and for Indian , where there are differences of nice and country there may of necessity be differences in minor points of organisation, but the privileges and the essential principles of the church are the same for all In her government and in her charities there is place for all The truth and the order of which we speak are no exclusive possession of 3 englishman, nor are they to be purchased only by conformity to English ways We do not aim at imposing upon on Indian church anything which is distinctively English, or even ] European The Word, the sacraments, and the episcopal ministry tlieBonro unchangeable they belong to no age or country, as they met the needs of Europe or of Asia many centuries ago they will meet the needs of the India of to day But in regard to the conditions under which these are presented the church adapts her self, and we desire to see her adapt herself more and more, to the circumstances and the property of every race of men and from these, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, her forms of service, her customs, and rules, and institutions will take an impress We trust that God has given this mission to the Church of England, to give to India that pure truth, and that divinely appointed order, in possession of which India shall work out her own spiritual life, bear spiritual fruit of her own, contribute her own spiritual gifts to the wealth of the universal Church of God We trust that we, for our part, with our clergy and laity, Bhull lime-green' to be faithful to this trust, neither selfishly eager to impose anything of our own on those who join us, nor weakly ready, for the sake of winning adherents, to keep back anything that is an essential part of what we are commissioned to convey. ' ' We speak not as men who wish to collect followers, but as ambassadors who desire to be loyal to the King who sent them, and to commend His message to those whom He addresses We speak also in the love we bear, for His sake, to those whom he loves It is he who says, by our lips, and by every ministration which is performed among us, ' Come unto me ' "The Church of England has been qualified by Him to bear this message For it may be truly said of that church that she holds entire and uncorrupt the inspired Word of God, which is read and exhibited in con tinuous and systematic instruction to all her members, that she retains and uses the three creeds which she has inherited from the earliest times, and appeals to the testimony of the councils and fathers of the undivided church that she has in the works of her own famous teachers a rich store of accurate and philosophical divinity, not as well as excess of scripture as in the ceremonies of religion, and the doctrine and proof of the personalty and attributes of the Creator, so precious in view of tbePontheisni Which Is deep rooted in Indian thought that she has ever been among the foremost in her witnessing the cardinal truths of the incar- nation ; and sacrifice of the Son of God, truths winch permeate, like life blood, every sentence other authoritative teaching, that by her insistence on the life giving presence in all her ordinances of the Holy Spirit, an insistence conspicuous in the importance she attaches to confirmation, she presents in its full proportion a side of truth which especially meets the needs of the present time, that as will in her less formal ministrations, where man carries direct to man the comfort with which he has himself been comforted by God, as in her offices, and; these capable of in (Illunie adaptation and increase, for every occasion of man's life from the cradle to the grave, her religion is a religion of the home and of the funds) Charged with these blessings which we hold in trust, we invite in earnest love the confidence of India. We invite this confidence in the sole ground that God, in his provi- dence, has put these things in our hands and charged us to offer them to all alike. We know of nothing that should weaken the force of this our invitation and appeal except our own shortcomings and those of our people. For those, as we continually seek forgiveness from Almighty God, so we ask ? pardon from all those to whom our message haSitliewby.been rendered less distinct and we pray that the name of Almighty God may be glorified both in theme and in us. 1 -"Finally, we commend all into whose hands this letter' rarely come to the guidance and grace officer who is ready to lead them into,all.tru.h, and bring them through a life of righteousness to everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
