' - some government land near Collarandi, .:iwhere he proposed to winter his .'-' thousand odd yearlings. He engaged me at j£6 a month to help him look after them. It was:. agreed that we should start-at .five o'clock the next morning and make an old sheep route six miles distant, the next night. After a hasty breakfast we started on our road, taking with us on a pack-horse ' '? our blankets, frying pan, etc., and last but not least, a gallon of good Scotch - fsM It was raining hard when we let \- the sheep out of the 1 yard, and it kept up all the livelongrday, :, ! tell you it was no fun tramping -overtha^country * witb fifty pounds of mud on -.each boot, under-a soaking rain, and I was heartily glad when evening came and we sighted an old deserted sheep camp. It took us a little time to patch up the tumble down concern and to collcct enough wood .to start a fire in the hut fire-place.' The hut -was a fair-sized one and'eontained two bunks and a big open fire-place,, in which we soon had a. blazing fire. 'Aftera hearty mealof canned meat, damper aud tea, .we lit our pipes and attacked the demijohn. ' As I said before, boys, Arthur Meredith was a gentlemanly-looking young fellow, so I was quite ready to believe ihe history of himself which lie . offered to give me by way of filling up tbe time till we turned in, and as it somehow to my mind — though I don't blow exactly how — seems to belong to 1 what happened afterwards, I will try as far as I can in his own words to re late it to you. He said : I am the son of a gentleman in North Wales — old country — and received a good educa tion at College. Being intended for the army, and very proud of the pros pect before me of one day becomir^ a General, I was anxious to pass all the examinations necessary for getting a commission. This I succeeded in doing, and being, like most Welshmen,, very proud of my country and descent, J was prouder still at being gazetted^ second lieutenant in a Welsh regiment. Our headquarters -were at that time in |p^-mW6reWeltb- i'lpn; including (he ^riettd ;. - o f tny ?year|i/l^|^^t^ passedover very quicklyandagre£ ably.

' 4 My bbi^de was a cheerful but quiet young iBtijglirfim an, and not at all given to practical jokes, so Iknew he bad nothing to -do with what 111 now tell you. One night I was very hot and restless and half dozing when some, trifling noise caused me to sit up and look at the door. Some slight gust from the hole in the wall had blown it to. A gleam of moonshine was half lighting up the door and table, while the bed and I were . in a complete shadow. As 1 looked I saw the door open very slowly and an arm — naked to the shoulder — came gradually in, crept noiselessly on to the table, lifted some thing, and like lightning disappeared. 1 leaped out of bed, gave a loud shout, which awoke Archie Sinclair, my chum, and we both rushed out into the open. Not a sound but the sentry was astir, and he declared no one had ap proached our but. In the morning I found my mon invaluable possession — the brooch, with its much prized reminder of my beloved! was gone. At mess that evening I informed the colonel of my loss, who advised me to keep a sharp look-out that night, as it was probable the thief would come again for something else. I was also unmercifully chaffed by my comrades as being one who thought so little of a sweetheart as to consign .her all niqht to a table instead of pressing her image always, night and day to my heart. 'That night I watched carefully, making sure that the door was in the same position, and lying awake all night, but the early tropical sun arose, and morning, or rather day, came without the thief. 1 1 was for putting up with the loss, however grievous, as the act of some extra clever native rascal, but my comrade Archie begged of me to try one more night — to sit on a chair for two or three hours behind the door with my sword handy and await events. I followed this plan out. I felt awfully drowsy after a while, but near mid night I thought I heard a faint whisper. I arose, grasping my sword firmly. The door slowly opened as before — the hand stretched out grimly, and seizing something which it appeared to fix somewhere, was gradually with drawing, when coming down on the shoulder — bare as it was— with a terrible stroke, my sword brought the 'aim clean off, and -it-droppeddn to the floor without .making thi' slightest noise. ^^^P^Sithjthe door fast^it would slbwir^B^Pid the mnt naked arm appe*np||||£-gth I grew so'.nervous and ill mtnwant ot rest that' I was forced to resign my commission, and my father fmdingtne the money, I am now out here for colonial experience and to see if sheep-breeding will pay. I may say that since j left Englaqd 1 have not been haunted by the 'Ghost of the Naked Arm.' Wallace, we'll turn in.' ' We did SO,''fasiterfing the rickety door as well as we could, and blocking up the larger cracks in tile hut with clothes and newspapers. . - 'It was Christmas Eve, and Arthur Meredith declared, that he would rest over Christmas Day in tbe hut and give the sheep a chance to rest and feed on the young grass that was abundant on the plain near tbe camp. It did not take. us long to get to sleep, and we had probably slept for three hour* when both of us were awakened - by a fierce growl from Scotty, my collie dog, who bad coiled himself up in front of the.now dying embers. '' Instinctively I grabbed my six-shooter and litrthe lantern we liad witb. us. Tbere stood Scotty, all the bristles on his back erect as the quill6 of an angry porcupine ? He was growling and sniffing althedOOT. Presently there came three loud riips on the door, which fairly shook the whole hut Simultaneously myself and Meredith shouted; ' Who's£here?' ' Breathlessly we awaited a rppiy — none came. I got up, took the lantern in one hand and my revolver in the other ani't^WiS# the door. Scotty rushed put, and, barking furi ously, chased some object which looked like a thin streak, of light about a man's height around the camp. 1 lollowed, but the object vanished in the darkness, and 1 was soon busy quieting the frightened sheep, vdiich had bunched together in a corner and threatened to break down the flimsy, fence. - On returning I met Meredith.. Heif too, had seen the spectral apparition, and entering the hut we gazed at each other for a minute, in silence, when he said: ? If I believed in ghosts I would take my oath that was one.' ' It,.must have been a pretty healthy one,' 1 answered, ' to knock as hard as it did, but I'll be hanged if I don't believe it was a ghost all the same.' We put fresh wood on the fire, and after a pipe and two or three drinks, turned in again. I could not sleep, how ever, for I must own though not superstitious I was somewhat scared and perplexed. I was half asleep and half awake when 1 heard Scotty utter a low, angry growl, anrj looking towards the door, saw, in the fire light, a long,, bony, bluish-looking arm push through an opening in the door and try to turn the latch.: ' I reached over and touched Meredith, who woke at once, and 1 pointed to the arm and hand. ' Get oui and grab it,' he whispered, and I quietly slid out of my bunk, pistol in hand, and seized the skeleton wrist. ? An unearthly yell came from the outside, but my hand held only a handful of dust. Banging open the door I gazed into the I'darkness, and skippui£. rapidly over | the plain again! \uvv ^hat 'Sireak of bluish light . Scotty, (jive VAase and was gone some fifteen minutes when ',B- SBEfl THE ARM AGAIN.' he came back with his tail between his legs, shivering like a man with' the ague. Neither of us wanted any more sleep, and so we sat up and talked over the odd. apparition until daylight, which, 1 tell you, we both hailed with delight. 1 tell- you, although it was Christmas Day, and the rain was pouring down, we didn't stay in that hut another night, but drove on some five miles to a road-side inn wliete. there was a well fenced paddock, and took our Qbrist mas turkey there..'
