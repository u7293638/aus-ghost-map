THE EVIDENCE OF A GHOST. Murderers have in many instances been convicted and executed by evidence that was elicited through the agency of a dream or some vague ghost story. It is not generally known, however, that two men were executed in the North of England, a little more than two hundred years ago, by the testimony of a ghost. In 1631, a woman named Annie Miller was murdered at Chester-le-Street. Her ghost, according to the local records, appeared to a miller who resided in the neighborhood, and told him the story of her murder. He informed the magistrates, who issued warrants for the arrest of John Walk- er and Mark Sharp. These two men were tried, before Judge Dapenport, at the next Durham Assizes, found guilty, and executed upon no other evidence than the story of the miller.-Newcastle Courant.
