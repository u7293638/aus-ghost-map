A Tory. " He is a poor creature that the march of events has left behind ; he is like a short legged drummer who cannot keep up with the movement of the regiment; he is a bung of a by-gone age, singing an old song, telling a forgotten tale; his mind is hung with cobwebs; he is the preter-pluperfect tense of politics; he is an extract from the lumber room, where we have thrown our ghosts, witches, .alehymists. We may laugh at Tories—there is no harm in that—inasmuch as no man is morally culpable for doing what he cannot help. But I would not persecute the poor creatures. I would let them live if it were only for antiquity's sake.' —Tail's Magazine.
