The Sisters of Nazareth are doing a great work in our midst in a quiet and unostentatious manner. They have to provide food and clothing for 140 orphans, besides sixty old and infirm men and women, and, in addition, to educate and provide the children with books. The number of their charges is daily increasing, but their inoome is not doing so in proportion. As the sisters receive no aid whatever from the Government, their home being entirely dependent on voluntary contributions for its support, it is to be hoped that those whom Providence has blessed with an abundance of this world's goods will not forget the orphan and the aged poor who find a efuge in this noble institution.
