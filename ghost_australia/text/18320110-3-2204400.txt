THE ROYAL CORONATION. (From the Courier, Sept. 8 ) This being the day appointed for the Coronation of their Majesties, the metropolis had an animated appearance almost from the commencement of day break. The artillery commended firing at five in the morning, and at an early hour numbers of persons were seen pouring in different directions towards the great focus of attraction;-Westminster Abbey ; and much interest was excited in the neighbourhood of Partiament-street, where numbers of seats had been erected for the accommodation of the public. A great number of persons, notwithstanding the coldness of the morning, were seated so early as five o'clock. At six o'clock a party of the Royal Artillery Corps of Volunteers arrived at St James's Palace, and took their station opposite. Shortly after eight, the barriers on the Surry side of West- minster-bridge were closed. At twenty minutes before eleven o'clock a dis- charge of artillery announced that his Majesty had quitted the Palace. The yard of the Palace was surrounded by elegantly dressed females. The Royal carriage was preceded by several others. His Ma jesty sat bare-headed, with a high ruff round his neck, and appeared remarkably well. Her Majesty sat by his side, but rather higher, and wore a crown of pearls. As the carriages passed, the bands which had been previously stationed in the line of the pro- cession played " God save the King." Six beau- tiful cream-coloured horses splendidly caparisoned, attended by grooms in their state liveries, followed the retinue. As his Majesty passed the Park he was received by a salute from the guns placed there for that purpose. As the procession proceeded, the King and Queen were loudly greeted by the assem- bled populace, who mingled their voices with the in- struments of the military in crying " God save the King." The Lord Chancellor came in the state car- riage, which is of very ancient appearance, having been in use more than a century, and it created con- siderable amusement among the mob. As soon as the procession had passed, the dense masses of peo- ple began to separate, and the throngs which before were anxiously hurrying towards tho point of at- traction were met moving in the opposite direction, and proceeding in perfect good humour to their homes.

Their Majesties, and the Princes and Princesses, then proceeded out of the choir, and to the west door of the Abbey, attended as before ; their Majesties wearing their Crowns ; the King bearing, in his right hand, the sceptre with the cross, and, in his left, the orb ; and the Queen bearing, in her right hand, her sceptre with the cross, and, in her left, the ivory rod wlth the dove : their Royal Highnesses the Princes and Princesses wearing their coronets ; and the Princes, who are Field-Marshals, carrving their batons. The four swords were horne before the King, in the samo order as before. The Dean and Prebendaries, and the Bishops, who had carried the Bible, the chalice, and theo patina, remained in the choir. The noblemen who had severally carried the crowns, the orb, the sceptre with the dove, the spurs, and St. Edward's staff, walked in the same places as before ; those who have staves and batons carrying the same : all Peers wearing their coro- nets; and the Archbishops, and the Bishops sup- porting their Majesties, wearing their caps ; and the Kings of Arras their crowns. On arriving at the west door of the Abbey, Garter proclaimed the King's style. The swords and the regalia were received, near the west door, by the officers of the Jewel-office, ap- pointed for that purpose. Their Majesties, and the Princes and Princesses of the Blood Royal, returned to St. James's Palace with the same state as in their proceeding to the Abbey.
