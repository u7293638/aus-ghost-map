Iti was a quiet, iiee kind' of chap, Idid aut know hiot at all well. Ito was up ii these parts learning bnuking, wasn't be ? i remeulubetr him chiefly on t groat friend of oll tVaterllold, the Wtiker. Iuroly he was in Waterfeldo' bnuk i " " That's the nman. ' e was a great frisend of mine, blid he was a great friend of Kitty WYVterfield'n-ho used to talk to me about her." " I know a girl would be hlound to come ito the story soon., What is she like P Attractive i J don't know her even by sight." " Not the least ittractive. Good eyes and o white fare. Nobody knows anything about her. She never talks to anybody. She's either too shy or too reserved. I're known her all her life, and taken her in to dinner aboutthirty times. I once extracted frontm her a confeaussoa that she disliked tomatoes, Ibat that is thie only ecnlld' nce shbo, bas over hlonourel melo with. Still, Fergusos, I fancy, get a bit furthbe with hier tClina tiat. Indeed, he was desperately keen aon her. I can't for the life of ome imagine why, except for the fact that she I didn't ecro two straws about him. She used tC he rude to him, Ihoogh, rind that was all ad. vacne on the distantly polite attitude she adopted towards everybody else. " Well, at the last Bachelor's BDll but one, Ferguson and Miss Watorlield danced togetllhe morq than onre, I can vouch for that, atid they sat out together pretty often too. Sho was never ill much demand as a partner, though lie was pouolarenough ; but he never looked at anybody else that ingbht. Ills eyes followed her, like a dog's eyes all over the room ; and she went about, either with him, or without him, e pale, inscrutable sphinux, looking neither happy nor nhoasppy, bht absolutely unconcerned. HIhe looeked rather pretty thCt light, but whether she enjoyed herself or not I have not the least idle. Old Ferguson had promised to come it and have a smoke with me after the dance: and as he we was utlting his coaton in the cloak-room, I ssid Yeu're coming ronul for a pipe, oh P' lie said t ' Nt t.oight, I bthik. I'm a bil doe up somehoaw.'' I thought hI seemed rathIel low-spirited and tiredl,ald he shook behands with me, which was rather a rum thing to do. Well, that was four years ago, and I have never set eyem on the man since. Mind the clock, tFrank, your right foot as dangerously near it." " Yot ought not to y such startling things, then. Go on." "Thu next day Ferguson left Littleborough withouta word to anybody. His letters wore to be forwarded to him at some club in London, I forget which. Maost Ioplu wondered at his going, nod etiOol biio not a little ; but the only ?emson who could throw any light on it was Miss Wateorfcld, and nobody in his senses ever dreamed of puwning her. She weat on just as usual ntt Inooking eithler mcluecholy eor relieved, but simply expresaionless. I spoke to hlier once abouutInm, but shoenever anorsreld, and I chanlged the subject to Itome, whiere she had just brin. She, was not exactly garrulous on that topio either; tut that is neither here nora hier. " We had just issued the invitations for tihe next Btchelor's Ball year after, til Charlie Dasridon, wht wmso engaped to It manrried at tle time hbtad eignnliased bhis farewell alilearller as Secretary ly msahin even bigger mnea of the ball tbau usual..

I knew at onl ? he had sent )tetr.Perguson a card for ltie ball, and fdr once I felt rather sorry, for him, an he looked very milch upiet. " Ytaung llaliburto:, however, began to crack his customary jokes at Charlie's exrailensu 1f1 observed tlhat we should have a cheerfll ball if pverrrbody or retary eour sr'ta ilnviten turned Iup, nnd was further anxious to discover if Quenu Alnnte hal lleen nakel, aipyilng he thought Shlu utight Ihe tifelnded at the omiosion.
