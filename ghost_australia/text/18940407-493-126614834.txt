When tablecloths are found to begin to wear out in the middle or at other folds, a few inches cut off at one end and one side will alter the place of all the folds completely, and give a new lease of life. The same may be done to napkins, if large enough to allow it, as well as to towels, and the house- linen will thus wear longer and look tidy to the last. An interesting anecdote is being told of the late Mr. Aynsley Cook's appearance in an American law court as a basso. He was, it is said, in his early career engaged for an American tour. After a few weeks the ' ghost ' censed to walk, and the manager was sued by an irate creditor, who pleaded that the manager was to blame for having engaged so poor a company. This the manager denied, and asked leave to send for the ' least known member ' of the company, that he^miglit sing to the court. Mr. Aynsley Cook was selected, and sang ' The i Village Blacksmith ' in a way that took the court by storm. The judge dismissed the suit, making a jocular remark about the creditors musical edu cation having been sadly neglected. j Some two hundred and fifty thousand canarie, are trained each year in the Har a region of Gemanys and oE these 200,000 are sent to the United StateB, 27,000 are sent to England, 10,000 aw sent to Russia, 'and other European countries, and 10,000 tomain in Germany.
