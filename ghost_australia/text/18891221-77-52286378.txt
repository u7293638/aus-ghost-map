J Mrs. Milbanke waa seated at a pretty tea table, lighted with a pretty copper {amp. Dolly was half buried io an easy chair with the last new book in her lap. Swyntord hoped she waa enjoying her literature. She looked ap with a mUchievooa emile and «aid ehe «aa, though she must confess it WSB (nil of sadness, not to say horrors. Stepnisk'e " Bnssia under the Czars," she continued, this time turning her blue eyes towards Philip, «rho, of course, became immediately Inter- ested. Her sisters had suggested the book as a desirable ooo to have lying about since they had seen the sketch on Philip's easel, and they had driven down to Mudie'a for it before going borne after they had left the studio that very afternoon. It had not taken Dolly half an hour, the half hour after dinner, to get at the tone of the work, and to know just enough to let Philip see that she was interested is the subjects wbiob interested bim. "Tes," he replied, sitting down by her side, " it a painful subject, though one might be forgiven for expecting to find something noble Tn pages inscribed with snob a title -but there is in the record of its martydoma." There was something fateful in Philip's appearance and manner; he was pale, his blaok bair was dishevelled, it fell in a great shook over his forehead, his long bands were particularly white, and there was apoetio melancholy io the expression ofilia sallow face that suggested much thought and work. All this made bim interesting in Dolly's estimation, and she was also taken by the air of distinction which seemed to belong to those student-like characteristics whioh were so opposite to the happy professional air of her brother-in-law, and to the smug city cheer- fulness of Samuel Swynford, of Lombard street. " I have always been deeply conoerned in regard to the fate of political prisoners in Russia," continued Philip, " and just now I am thinking of little else. I suppose there is a touch of selfishness in this inoresBed devotion, becauae I am putting my feeling« and my imagination into commission as it were j I hope they will asiist me to carry off the Gold Medal." " Oh, that is the seoret of tbe sketch we saw this afternoon V said Mrs. Milbanke. " Ton forgot to tell us ; or perhaps it is a secret." "Forsyth thought he would not spoil a good subjeotfor conversation this evening," chimed in tbe hoBt. " Yes, my dear, I will have a cup of tea ; don't approve of tea as a rule, ' but to-night we'll merry be' as the song says, eb, Swynford I" Walter did not quite know what he was saying ; cot that he had had too much wine, but his wife had been making signs at bim, and be tried to hide bis non- understanding of them under a ripple of talk, " A good ola song," be went on ; "I remember my father sieging it when I waa a boy at a birthday yea, my dear, Mr. Swyoford will take a cup of tea, and by the way, Swynford, you are a judge of water oolonrs. I would like to show you a little portfolio I bought last week- a collection of landscapes and figures-two little Turners, half a dozen David Cox's, a Caloott, and a couple ot sketches by Landseer ; here it is, my boy." 'And Walter, having suddenly caught the, meaning of his wife's nod, had led Sam to the furthest end of the room, away from Philip and Dolly, and was soon deep in tbe mysteries of tbe portfolio in question, getting Barn's ideas of ito value, not only artistically but financially, together with bis views of the present inflated state of the money market and other matters of current interest. Meanwhile Philip responded to Dolly's sympathetic inquires about prison life in Russia, the high-handed character of what was termed administrative arrest, and what he intended to convey in that sketch, in which the woman's faoe WAS BO remarkable as to have set Jenny talking of nothing else ever axloce they bad seen it, Philip rode nie hobby gracefully, with eloquence and with know- ledge, and paused more than once to note bow beautiful Dolly was, and what a contrast were her red lips, ber bright genial eyes and «arm healthful flesh, oompared with the «roman of the opera, " the ghost of Madame Lapukln," as Dick Chetwynd had styled her. Presently Jenny bad drawn her chair near the two young people, to hear Philip's story of this woman at the opera and MB desire to have her aa a model for the face in his medal picture ; and by and by she led their con- versation up to their trip to Italy and the poetic loveliness of Venice, where she assured him he would find a model in every woman of the people whom he met. She bad only been to Venice once, and then only for a week, and she thought she bad seen more beautiful women during those seven days than ever she had aeen in her like before. Philip in reply could not resist the suggestion that it was not necessary to go to Venice to look for beauty ; and if he accompanied them be should ask the favour of putting Dolly into a Venetian picture, for so far as be was any judge of the peculiarities of the Venetian face he thought Dolly herself possessed that curl of the lip and that sun- shine in the hair wbicb was auppoBed to be thoroughly Venetian. Without aeemiog to say lt, the olever little matohmaker let Philip also understand that Dolly was also blessed with a certain golden snnabine in the Three per cents, which his mother. Lady Forsyth, thought an important item in the charms of marriageable young ladies. It is difficult to fathom the thoughts of man, and to Bay whether the best of God's oreatures is mercenary or not, whether the most virtuous may not be influenced now and then by the worst passions. So far as the narrator of this history is conoerned, he is inclined to think Philip did not note the worldly hint of Mrs. Milbanke, or, if he did, that it bad no influence with him, though the hostess more than once made some paBsiog reference to the responsibilities of marriage being so greatly lessened if there was money on both sides ; or if there waa money on one side and genius on the other, quite in a more or less inconsequential way, getting in a reference to au artist whom they both knew who was very clever but still could not sell his pictures, and what an important thing it was in art for a man to be more or lees independent of dealers, so that be could afford to follow the bent of his genius or his inclina- tion, and do the work he liked best ; and so on-an eloquent rush of worldly wisdom, most ueefnl in regard to young people about to contract a marriage, and especially to a couple of young people, the bride pretty, with money and social position, and the bridegroom an artist also with social position, a little money, perhaps, and no end of genius and ability, if he could only paint what he wished and be Independent of the Academy and of dealers ; andsomebow Philipfouod himself, be- fore be quite knew where be was, discussing these delicate matters, as if be or Dolly, or both, were personally concerned in them. And once. Dolly's band being near Philip's he laid his upon hers, and she not with- drawing it, he pressed the fair hand, and was very sensible of its soft pliability. The gentle pressure thst responded to his, when he ventured a little further and took Dolly's hand fairly within bia own, set hit heart beating, and he forgot everything exoept Dolly and his mother's praises of her. It came into his miad that lt wonld please tab mother very ranon if he married Dolly, and that abe «aa vary beautiful, had golden hair, a a weet voice, and cheerful mannen, and that aometimea Fate met one half way, aa it were, and aome- timea clapped one on the aboulder unawares, and that after all it would be a pleasant Fate to be entitled to take Dolly to one's arms, and have her for a lifelong companion. While Walter Milbanke was fooling Samuel Swynford, it was as good aa settled that his hopes were to be utterly crushed. Wby, therefore, prolong the description of this evening one moment more than is necessary to acquaint the reader with the malu incident of the night T Swyuford felt uncomfortable, and said be must go earlier than he bad intended ; he spoke of some important business be had in the city the next morning at ten, sud took a cheerful leave of Weatbnry Lodge two boors before Philip ; and long before that favoured young gentleman said " Good-night," he had been alone with Dolly for three parts of that time, both Walter and bis wife having business in another corner of their pretty bonse ; Mrs. Milbanke to see the children put to bed (though they bad been in bed for hours), and Walter to auswar a couple of letters which had come in by the lsst post. It was a blissful time for Philip while it lasted ; a dream of a new and unexpected kind of happiness ; a dream in which hands clasped hands, and lips touched lips ; a dream in which a soft, sweet, blushing girl confessed that she loved hun; a dream in which be believed he loved her better than anything or anybody in all the world. And eo it was settlrJS that a fortnight later Philip Forsyth should aeootnpany the MU bankes on a tour through France, Italy and Switzerland, with a long vacation in Ventee, and that during their wanderings they should settle the month in which Philip should make Dolly his wife. " Man proposes," CHAPTER VI.-" WHAT FATES IMPOSE, THAT MEN MUST MEEDS ABIDE." They awoke to a new life the next day, several persons in tbis history. The old order of things had changed in a night. Dolly held a new position in tbe eyes of her- self, ber relations and friends; she was " engaged." Mrs. Milbanke entered upon a freah phase of existence; her sister had "accepted" Mr. Philip Forsyth; Lady Forsyth would be Dolly's mother-in-law. Mr. Samuel twynford might no longer feel that in his city operations be was working for a future iu whioh Dolly Norcott would have the leading part. Dick Chetwynd believed that the oareer of his friend Philip Forsyth bad now become secure. Hitherto his pro- spects had needed the ballast of responsible j duties. Married to Dolly, bis ambition would be fostered by an absence of what the young fellow had considered the absolute necessity of earning bis own living ; for although Lady Forsyth bsd a fair iucome, abe spent every penny of it and did not keep cut of debt, and I the possibility ot her death and bis inheritance of the property left by his father did not for a moment enter into Philip's calculations. ! Lady Forsyth felt something like a sense of triumph in the engagement ot Philip and Dorothy, for many reasons; it scoured her son's independence, it relieved her of a kind of a responsibility aa to bis f ature, she liked Dolly, thought the Milbsnkes pleasant successful people, and the excitement of the wedding and getting ready for it would be an agreeable break in ber life, which lively as it was in a general way, the tune of it was all on one string. Philip went to his studio on that memorable next day, unhitched his bell, wrote "Out" on his wicket, locked the door, put the key in his pocket, and entered upon a reflective solitude. The Regent's Park studios were a pretty, redbrick duster of buildings north of Prim- rose Bill, designed and erected for art work, and for personal comfort, byan enterprising architect who recognised the progressive movement of the times, and in the right spirit provided a calm retreat for workers who could afford to pay a fair rent for their accommodation. Tbe studios bad a general portal, io which rssided the Parter and his wife, who kept a small staff of sw raja ta for tbe purpose ol attending to the domestic and culinary requirements of the tenants. Passing through this general portal, wblob had its gates and boura on th» principle of an old fashioned college or inn, you came into a courtyard, around whioh the studios were ranged, eaoh with its individual retiring rooms and offices. Some of tbe men lived there altogether ; one occupant, after some protests and difficulties with the landlord, had been permitted to bring borne bis wife there; another house wss oooupied by a lady artist, and thus the humanising influence of woman had entered through the general portal and given a pleasant tone to the place, From the moment that Hymen had come in there, Bathetic blinds, red-raddled flower pott, out- side mats, birds in cages, and gay flower-beds had appeared ; while the harmless, neoessary oat baa bad a ribbon tied around ita neok, and the colony bad made itself look just as fay and marry aa it undoubtedly was, There ad been little luncheons and an occasional reception prior to the entrance of Hymen with bis torah ; but they were es nothing compared with the gatherings whioh had made the place musical and floral in these latter days, when the Regent's Park Studios have become famous not only for the work they turn ont, but for their Bocial gaieties. Nobody would ever be able to work and play as well in the same place, it wsrfeared, when Hymen waa permitted tc light his torch with- in tbs sacred precincts ; but " Out" made any studio safe from interruption. " Out," com- municated to the Porter's Lodge, was as powerful a talisman of protection from callers as if the painter who exhibited the legend on hut wioket bad been leagues away ; and so the opportunity for serious work wss scoured. It was e tribute to the earnestness and industry of tbe region, during the weeks immediately preceding the Spring Exhibitions, that, as a rule, the entire colony was " out" from early morn till dewy eve ; and Philip's " out" was therefore not singular on this bright and breezy April morning. There was a cheerful fire in bis stove. The sou was streaming in at his western window. Having promptly drawn a blind down against the radiant light, Philip took off his black morning coat and waistcoat, and put on bis brown velvet working jacket, removed bisboots in favour of a pair ot white tennis shoes, and took up a position of observation with his back to the'stove, which waa a handsome terra cotta oonstructiou, German in Appear- ance, but with the advantage of an open grate, makiog it a compromise between England and the foreigner so much as to retain the national prejudice io favour of an open fire, while it secured the German and Russian practicability of a real heating stove. Philip stood with bis back to the fire and surveyed the room ; not that he saw anything in it, but be surveyed it all the same, looked round it, np at the roof, and down at the floor, the couch with ita tiger skin, bis low easy chairs with their fluffy cushions, bis parquette floor, with its rugs, bis screen full of rough sketches, his throne for sitters, his two great easele, his cabinet crowned with papers of all kinds-drawings, old engravings and new sketches-sud bb wardrobe full of costume», the sketch on bis easel covered with a piece of silk, the door opeoiog ioto one of his retiring rooms, with its cartoons in the little passage way, bis small collection ol plastio ware scattered here and there, and bis statuettes of a Russian peasant, aod a baked clay model cf a Polish patriot. AI/ these things he looked at but did not see ; bis mind was occupied with other images, with other thoughts; it was not altogether, absent from the studio, but it was making curious and strange journeys outside tbe porter's lodge, and busy with thoughts thal went out far away, and with strange day- dreams. Did be love tbe girl to whom last night fae had engaged himself in a lifelong bond 7 Or in what he bad said vu Ce pledged ti that serious compact of marriage t If love was that absorbing passion he hat dreamed ot, waa he in love with Dolly ! Waa not hit last night's engagement i sudden impulse, in wbiob there was a gow deal of passion and Tory little lore* Waa Dolly the ideal of womanhood he had dreamt of aa an artist, and read of in the poete T Waa abe not rather a pretty, clever, little woman of the world, her heart in the atedio of the milliner rather than in the studio of the painter ? Did ehe really care for Art 7 Was Beauty without the refining grace of oultare and sentiment really Beauty t Would any man have been happy with the most perfect goddess of tte Grecian sculptors ! Did Providence for that matter ever combine true physical beauty with intellectual graceT Had not Dolly and her sister, and even Walter, eeemed last night to enter into a oharming conspiracy to get bim to ask Dolly to be his wife? Had uot Walter's genial wine, the eweet incense of admiration, the soft, oozy, healthful charms of Dolly, been sensuous, as opposed to the »piritwUe tempta- tions whioh should guide the choice of a lover who looked for a wife superior to the wiles of Society and to the frivolous attractions of dress? s These questions, not exactly in definite shape, but shadowy, passed before bim, with- out answers, Thsy seemed to have the accompaniment of aome strains of music from Carmen, and his thoughts wandered away to the Opera, and to the beautiful, sad face in the curtains of Lady Marohmount's box. He listened, and could hear faintly tbs strains of a street band, which was playing a passage from the very scene which bad for him been interrupted by that strangely fascinating presence which he bad endeavoured to suggest io his medal picture. His eyes wandered to the easel, and as they did so, the remuant of grey silk whioh bad covered his sketch gradually Blipped down upon the floor, and there was the face looking at bim, through its deep red halo and its accompanying figures of misery and suffer- ing. There was nothing supernatural in this, though it exercised an uncanny kind of influence upon Philip. The truth ia, the drapery had been gradually slipping away for hours, influenced by the increasing gravitation ? of tue heaviest part to the floor and the entrance of Philip, the abutting of the door, and his moving about, so that it fell away just at a critical moment in Philip's re- flections, and his imaginative nature found in the incident a shadow of a protest against the chief event of the previous night. If Dolly's face only gave you the idea that there was something behind it, be went on mentally saying to himself, an intellectuality beyond mere worldliness, how much more beautiful it would be I But he could lead her into the direotion of the studieB he liked ; he could give ber an ambition higher than that of shining in Society ; be could bring her sympathies within bis own control. Could he? There was the rub. And there, still before him, was his idea of the face which of all others be had ever seen possessed intellectual fire, poetic sentiment, but had withal a something fearful in its great ejes, and ^something thrillingly mysterious in its sudden appearance and in its no less startling disappearance. He walked to the easel, picked np the silk remnant, and glanced roana the room as if he expected to eee some one ; then mechanically wrapping np the piece of silk, placed it carefully away in his wardrobe, took up his palette, wiped it, and oommenced to squeeze a series of colour tubes upon it. While he is thus engaged, let us glance at him critically, lt is a promjamg youth, not quite rugged enough perhapstor the making of a man of action, but at the same time betokening firmness, good health, ambition, checked, however, by one physiognomical drawbaus, a somewhat weak chin, and with eyebrows that aa a rule rarely accom- pany a happy disposition. Lavater bas some notante views opon the meeting eyebrows held by the Arabs to be so beau- tiful, and by old physiognomists to be the mark of oratt, but regarded by the master as neither beautiful nor betokening craft, but rather, giving the face a somewhat gloomy appearance denoting trouble of mind and heart. Similarly with the pointed chin; many people believetft to be the accompaniment of acuteness and craft, but Lavater knew many honourable persons with snob ohius, and he noted that their craft is the craft of the best dramatic poetry. Philip Forsyth had the melancholy eye- brows and the flaw of weakness in the chin, not as to the pointed ohln, but to the want of angularity, and the suggestion of retreat, coupled with a something negative in both its form and size ; but for these drawbacks, Philip's face was the face of an artist, aud a man of nobility of mind and ambition. The oompaot forehead, the thick blaok hair, the perfect nose-suggestive of the keystone to the Gothic arch, as Lavater regarded it-the ' dark, steadfast eyes, the strong hands with their long dexterous fingers, the well proportioned limbs, moderate breadth of shoulder wlfb narrow hips and easy graceful movements, all belonging to masculine beauty, and to a nature of keen sensibilities. Meeting Philip for the first time, you would have regarded him ss a young man out of the common ; but yeu might have oredited him with nursing an ambition be could not realise, or with a melancholy tum of disposition qualities which are not without attraction io the young, who are just beginning to realise the responsibilities of existence. . There was perhaps a further touch of weasV ness in Philip's individual characteristics namely, in his gait and manner. He did not walk straight and direct to anything : there was a something akin to feline grace- fulness in bis movements. He approached an objeot with a certain swerve of motion, as if be, more or less, walked in corves, as grace- ful actors do ; and this als* was charac- teristic of his mode of thought. It was to the line of retreat io the chin, its slight undersize, that physiognomists would credit this peculiarity, combined with a strong Imagination not under the full control of the logical or executive faculties. But these very weaknesses helped in many respects to add to the attractiveness of Philip's work and conversation. They made, for instance, Dick Chetwynd feel perfeotly safe in gu'iog bim advice, and added to Dick's satisfaction with the youug fellow's matri- monial engagement to a pretty, sensible girl not likely to bc led away by will-o'-the-wisps, and with sufficient money in the three per cents to give stability to bis social and domestic position. Philip, having laid his palette and brushes ] down by the easel, took fwm his pocket a cigar case, selected a cigar, lighted it, dragged a chair in front of his sketch, sat cross legged upon it and looked at the canvas steadfastly, Smoking all the time, and occasionally looking upwards, watching the blue wreaths break upon the cross beam, from which swung specimens of old flint guns, speers, bows and arrows, and a Roman corslet, With the eye of imaginât inn be saw bis pic- ture grow into what it might be, what he hoped it would be, not only a great work of art, but an everlasting rebuke to Russian tyranny, not simply the study to which the Academy had awarded the Gold Modal, but the study which had perhaps brought trie awful political disabilities of the KuBsisns home to the sufferers, helping the campions of the people to break the chains that kept Liberty in prison, galled its Seul), and wore its brain to madness. He had once seen a band of political prisoners nod crimioals start on their weary way to Siberia, and be had never forgotten it, nor would, though he was not more than nioe years old at the time. It was during the years his mother and father had lived in Moscow. Wherever they are condemned to Siberian exile by order of the Czar-everything is by order of the Cz»r in that vast, despotically-governed empira they proceed first to Moscow, where, after a brief sojourn in thc great oonvict priBon there, they start on their awful journey. The prison is some distance from the city, and Phillp remembered that he and bis father ross very early to see the exiles leave, his father having some mission of benevolence to one of them, which he waa allowed to undertake by order ol the Czar.
