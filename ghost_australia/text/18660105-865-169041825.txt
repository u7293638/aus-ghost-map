THE OLD CATHEDRAL ORGANIST. (From ‘Chambers’) Journal.’} •Ti, frrly years ago since first' I climbed these dusty, winding stairs -To play the Dean in: how I spurned Beneath my feet all meaner cares, When first Heant my cheek on fire. And looked down blushing a t the choir. Handel and Haydn and Mozart— I thought they watched me as I played, While Palestrina’s stern, sad face Seemed in the twilight to upbraid; Pale fingers moved upon tbe keys— The ghost-hands of past centuries. Behind my oaken battlement Above tbe door I used to lean. And watch, in puffing crimson hood, Come stately sailing in the Deau; On this the organ breathing low. Began to murmur soft and slow. I used to shut my eyef, and hear The solemn prophecy nnd psnlm Rise up like i license; and I loved Before the prayer the lull and calm. T ill, like a stream that bursts its batiks, Broke forth travc Purcell’s “ O give TbankB.” I know those thirteen hundred pipes And thirty stops, as blind meu do The voiceB of the friends they love. The bird’s song, and the thunder too; And the fierce diopason’s roar, lake stotms upon a rocky shore. And now to day I yield me up The dusky seat, my loved throne, Unto another, and no more Shall come here in the dusk alone, Or in an early matin hour, To hear my old friend’s voice of power. And yet, melhinks, that centuries lienee, Lying beneatli the chancel floor, In that dark nook I shall duliglst To hear the anthem swell once more, And to myself shall quietly smile. When music floods the vaulted aisle.
