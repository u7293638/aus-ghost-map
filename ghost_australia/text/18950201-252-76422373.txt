T fi E GHOST UPON THE STAIR. J. GERTRWDE MENARD. SÄie pauseth midway on the stair, Her step is like a breath. Pleasant was her wand»mg Adown the slopes of death. A»d pleasant was her journeying Across the dim divide, O'er bridges which »he day threw out, Unto the eventide. She is no spirit dark and dread, No soul of peace denied ; Within her calm eyes shines the light Of great love satisöad. And ye*, white-robed and innocent, At eve she loves to stray Unto the path she trod in youth : Thfc dear, familiar way. ~" She doth but come unto her own ; Dear duties to fulfil, What once was her inheritance, Doth need her presence still. For aH unbroken are the ties Tint bot*td her tender heart ; Her soul still guards what it held d«ar, Though silent and apart. And so she waiteth white and stMI, Yet fair, so passing fair ( Content for evermore to be, A wraith apon the stair.
