WEST SYDNEY ELECTION. THE NOMINATION. THR nomination of candidates preliminary to the election of a member for West Suluov to serve in the Legislative Assembly in place of Mr S A Joscph^rgsifenod, took place J3_J>Jüttl4m____u___at noonifisjerdij^-lho hustings was erected within the inclosures and the dry ingredients made were far better than they usually are upon such scenes as When the proceedings commenced their, were two or three hundred persons in front of the hunting, hut before they terminated there were several thousand Mr Jon> WHIIAMI the Returning officer, appeared at it feelings "l 12 ° clock' "" ' stated that the "TOLLing was called for the purpose of nominating and electing a member of the Legislative Assembly for West Sydney in half of one of the former representatives, Mr Joseph Mr \\\1ll1aniB then read the Speakers vi if, the authority by which the meeting had been convened, and expressed a hope that the persons present would give a fair and impartial hearing to proposers, seconders, and candidates and thus sustain the character which the electors of West Sydney had hitherto borne as that of most orderly and peaciblo«ti7ens He concluded by calling upon the pro- poser of the first candidate in the hold-Mr Dransfield Mr SHERIDAN Mooan Bud he came before the doctors at a few moments notice, in the absence of a distinguished barrister and scholar, to propose for their acceptance a man well qualified to represent them in the Parliament of this country a working man, but at the same time a man of education, one who had risen from the ranks, but in the hardest school of discipline, commerce, and speculation, and as an employer of labour hid well qualified himself to represent the electors of West Sydney Although he differed from Mr Dransfiold on one essential question, the question of free trade and protection, he was glad to say that his political sentiments who gravitating to the same conclusion as his own, and he believed that before Mr Dransfiold had been in P irlwmunt many years he would be prepared to abolish that temple of iniquity, the Custom-house (Laughter ) But he proposed honest Dick Dransfield on other groundsel proposed him because he had given (Mr Moore) a pledge that one of the first acts of his political life would be to get a working man's college He would exert himself to got employment for those who required it but upon economical principles, and would have them profitably employed instead of lounging about the streets Another reason why he proposed Mr Dransfiold was because he was not the representative of the yellow lily faction on the one hand, nor the tool of any broken down politician on the other The probabilities were that we should have a fearfully hot summer, and drought and famine may be the result With such a prospect before them, it was high time that those miserable factions should terminate It was high time that the Montagues and the C ipulots of that House in Macquarie street should be put down, and that " the war of the Roses, and the " Yellow Lily, ' or of any other vegetable product, should cease Let them strike a blow at once at these fictions which caused so much religious animosity in the community He hoped on some future day to express his political sentiments to them at greater length, but he would now conclude by proposing honest Dick Dnmsflold as a fit and proper person to represent them in Parliament Mr JAMES COX LMAN came forward to second the nomination of Mr Dransfield He should not, he said, have appeared before them that day as the second of the nomination of a candidate only that he did not want to see Protection go to the dogs [A voice " No fear of that ] If he had not been a protectionist, he should not have come here to day (Cries of " Cut it short ") He should not cut it short He should take his time in accordance with the provisions made by the returning officer Dr Lane once said, " When the brains are out the man will die" (Loud laughter) There was not much talk in him (Mr Coleman), and therefore he would not keep them long (Renewed laughter) He had no quarrel with Mr Campbell nor with Mr Wearne , his quarrel was with the protectionists There were members now in the House who had bamboozled the protectionists, who had got them to hold public meetings and afterwards played into the hands of the Government, and said their principles for bigotry They would now understand what had brought him here He was not the tool of any party, but he came there to protest against those abominable hypocrites The time was coming when the working men's eyes would be opened, although he might be in a minority today He found that their worthy secretary, who thrust himself upon them when the Industrial League was formed, went to that best of gentlemen (Mr Macleay) and got him to promise to become president of the League It took him (Mr Coleman) a long time to find this worthy secretary out, but he had found him out at last in the first place, he went to the Exchange and signed a free trade petition Then he called a meeting in the name of the colonists to protest against the borrowing of £3 000 000, which the Government proposed to borrow , but he intended it to be a failure with a view of strengthening the late Government, but the protectionists turned out well, and the meeting proved a success His next move was to become editor of what was called a protectionist newspaper, started by a poor honest tradesman, who came from the country to get an honest living but the editor became a trimmer to the late Government, no one would buy the paper, so it died (Cries of time ). He should take his time His next ground of complaint was that while the secretary of the Industrial League, be, without Consulting his party, went into the country to oppose the return of one of the new Ministers Whether the picture of Mr Martin behind a tree Hardingham a purse of money represented a true state of things, he could not Bill He (Mr Coleman had come here to-day to denounce him Then there was their old alderman, Mr Murphy in whom they had so much confidence at one time When he saw him at Mr Barry s lecture clapping his hands, he thought it was an improper thing for a magistrate to do a Tho RETLRNrsr-orricPtt expressed a hope that the spa alter would keep more closely to the question Mr COLEMAN said he was denouncing Mr Murphy as a protectionist He lost faith in men when they handed themselves together to uphold bigotry It did not profit him to come here to day to fall out with people, but he liked to deal with honest men Too many of those who had called themselves protectionists had played into the hands of the Government and had been looking after office, sinecures, and pensions With respect to the candidate whose nomination he rose to second, he was sincere in his acts, his motives, and his conduct There were some shopkeepers here who opposed protectionists now but when they had to pay for a license to trade they would come and work with the poor protectionists He was very much obliged to them for the healing they had given him and he would conclude by saying that Mr Dransfield was actuated by pure and proper motives, and he would be approved of by them all (Cheers and laughter.) Mr PHIKES was received with an outburst of cheers and groans and, for some time, was unable to obtain a hearing He persisted, however, in asserting his right to be heard, and in pointing out that before others Could speak, the electors must hear what he had to say He came here he said, because he was an elector, and the candidate he had to propose, he believed, would be returned to-morrow (Cheers) The two or three score persons who were making the noise now would only induce honest and independent electors to vote for the gentleman he had the satisfaction to nominate as a fit and proper person to represent West Sydney in the Legislative Assembly (Cheers ) The electors would be swayed, not by the noise made here, but by reason and justice There were three candidates from which the electors had to choose, One was Mr Dransfield, of whom he know nothing, but he should think, by the speeches of the gentlemen who proposed and seconded his nomination, that they undertook to support a Protectionist candidate merely to enable them to denounce Protection for certainly they had uttered no single word in support of Mr. Dransfiold s principles Then we had the other candidate, Mr Campbell and he wished to say of that gentleman very little indeed He was put forward because he was the son of one of the most honourable men who ever lived amongst us But there was another side of this argument If Mr Campbell was submitted because his father was an honourable man, and because he possessed a splendid fortune, surely we had a right to reverse the question, and ask what he would be if he were not the son of Robert Campbell, and did not possess this splendid fortune (Cheers ) Suppose he came before the electors on his own merits alone, as did Mr Wearne, would there be any hesitation shown in making a choice between the two candidates .? (Cries of "No, no") This was a time when every tub should stand on its own bottom (Cheers ) Let every man stand on his own ments Were we to be told in this free country that its greatest constituency was to be made a family borough p That day was gone by, and it was not because any man happened to be connected with honourable and influential members of society and possessed a splendid for- time that he was to be foisted upon the electors as their representative (Cheers ) He now would refer to the gentleman he was about to nominate and who, he was sure, the electors would return to morrow at the head of the poll (Loud cheers ) That gentleman was Mr Joseph Wearne (Continued cheers ) This goal Hellion came before them as a respectable member of society (Cheers ) He was known to the electors as a manufacturer as an active citizen as a man who relying upon his own strength of character, his own ability, his own energy, had passed through the world without reproach, and made good his claim to the great honour he now sought (Cheers ) Mr. Wearne had expressed his sentiments on the great questions that now occupied public attention, and was sound on all of them. He was sound on the land question, and would go in for enlarging the legislative enactments of the country so as to afford ample opportunities for every industrious man to have a home of his own He was in favour of a system of education which would secure to every child in the country that instruction which would enable him to perform properly the duties of citizenship Mr Wearne was opposed to State-aid The other candidate was brought forward by a gentleman the most prominent opponent of the Public Schools Act, supported by the men who now under all kinds of specious pretences were endeavouring to strike a foul blow at the liberties of the country We had fallen upon 11 singular time in the history of the country when there was a class of politicians who did not tell the electors what they wanted, but got young gentlemen of unsteady principles, no purpose in life, and no object set before them, and obtained from them previous pledges as to a course of conduct, and then came before the public and supported them on entirely different grounds The electors must resist this uncertain kind of influence, and insist upon every candidate nailing his colours to the mast speaking out what he meant Mr Wearne had done this, and he (Mr. ' Parkes) was perfectly sure the result of this election would be that the electors would be morrow show their approval of his conduct by voting him a seat in the Legislative Assembly All that we wanted in this country was a fair field and no favour We all stood on a ground of equal), and the electors ought never to sanction the doctrine that-ray man's son was better than theirs Our s was a field for advancement open to the son of the poorest man as will as to the son of the richest and he counselled the electors never to give their votes for any man merely be cause some one else had rendered services to The country He Knew the electors of Sydney well, and he know that is a rule they would return the best man , therefore he relied upon the result of the poll to-morrow as entitling Mr W came to a seat in the Assembly He now proposed Mr Joseph AVearno as a fit and proper person to represent the electorates West Sydney in the Legislative Assembly (Loud cheers ) Mr II Cr uiKV seconded Mr Wearne's nomination He said he had known that gentleman longer than Mr Parkes, as an honest tradesman who had worked himself up by industry and energy) to his present position of indo prudence It was a good one when a man did well in his pi is late affairs by honest, honourable, and independent actions that he would make a good representative in the Legislative Assembly Mr AVearno had at his several meetings explained his views to the electors, who had received them with general approbation Mr AVearno was sound on the question of State aid, and was in favour of a still more liberal land bill than that of Mr Robert- son He would try to improve the measure by giving facilities that would place more settlers on the land than at present existed He did not come forward under the wings of any gentleman (cheers and uproarious on his own merits He (Mr Clarke) had no acquaintance with Mr Campbell or Mr Dransfield The father of the former was a very estimable man but the son was scarcely known and did not come forward on his own merits, but was brought forward by people it was scarcely necessary to name Mr AVearno, on the contrary, rested his claim to thosnfiiagcs of the electors on his own merits, and would vote for measures, not men, and, no doubt, tomorrow would be found at the head of the poll Mr Cow i ii, who was warmly cheered, said he was not so great a man as the proposer of Mr AVearno, and he therefore hoped that the electors would deal gently with him in consequence (I daughter ) He appeared before them to day not to ask any thing for himself, because he had nothing to ask He had no political object in view beyond a simple desire to see them well represented He hoped the desire of the electors would be to return a number who would act honestly towards them, and not disgrace the confidence they reposed in him He regretted that elements of disc rd and bitterness had been introduced into this contest, not by the candidates but by the plan sible and deep designing parties who had addressed public Hireling on their behalf Mr Campbell had no contest with Mr AVearno beyond that of an honourable man He desired to represent West Sydney and so did Mr Wearne Mr Wearne, he believed, was everything that his proposer had said of him He believed him to be an irreproachable and highly exemplary colonist They had no quarrel with him, and, at the electors preferred him, Mr. Campbell, and his friends would bow to their decision (Cheers) He had, however, a few words to say about the candidate he had the honour to propose It had been stated that Mr Campbell's fam ii) were opposed to his candidature He (Mr Cowper) could now say that Mr Campbell s uncle (Mr John Campbell) was here to give that assertion the ho (Cheers.) He had listened with something like surprise to some of the state ments which had been made on this occasion Was it to be a charge brought against a gentleman that he was the son of one of the most worth) colonists we ever had' Were. the electors, because Mr Campbell happened to be descended from the Campbells of the Wharf, to be put on their guard against him as a person not proper to represent them ' (Cheers ) He should think if there was one thing which recommended a gentleman to them more than other things, it would be that he had good antecedents But they were asked to throw all these overboard and accept some statement from somebody to the effect that there was a possibility that Mr Campbell might not turn out to be as good a man as Mr A came. He hoped the electors would judge for themselves, taking all matters into consideration, and not decide that because Mr Campbell happened to be the son of Mr Campbell of the fact that therefore he ought not to be accepted' He asked them not to reject Mr Camp- I bell, but to give him an opportunity of doing what no desired (Cheers) He was actuated by a land able limbs- I tion to give his talents, whatever they may be, to the service of the country. He was anxious to support in the Parliament of the country liberal measures the electors were indebted to his father as much as chair) man then alive, for the right they possessed this day to vote for any man she) pleased The late Robert Campbell was one of the most zealous and ardent co-operators in endeavouring j to obtain the Electoral Act (Applause ) He was one of those who assisted to carry the bill to oppose State aid The electors were indebted to the father of the candidate he now proposed for that great measure which they valued and which was now almost universally approved The late Mr Campbell was one of the most liberal members of the Legislature with regard to the Land Act Many years ago he voted for the reduction of the price of land, which was now considered a most desirable measure Had that land Act which was supported by Mr Campbell been carried, we should have had that which it was necessary not to fight for-a reduct n in the price of land But the electors and been told with a confidence almost claiming, that Mr AVearno was of necessity to be at the head of the poll (Cries of Soho will," and "No fear ) If Mr Wearne should be there as the deliberate choice of the electors, the friends of Mr Campbell would submit to the decision, but he hoped they would not reject Mr Campbell on the grounds that had been stated On the contain, he hoped they would support him They might do this to a great extent on the ground of his father s services, which they had no right to ignore what induce- ment was there for a man to sacrifice his life to their service if they said to the sons of those who had served them "we will reject you To take suckacour»o would be to show that we had no feeling of gratitude no desire to reward public service But was that the language the electorate of West Sydney was expected to hold to young gentlemen after their fathers had brought them up, and qualified them for good positions J Were they to be told that that very circumstance was to be taken as a ground for excluding them from the Legislature ' He hoped they would take Mr Campbell, and give him a fair trial If he proved to be not deserving of their confidence they would soon have an opportunity of recon- sidering their decision Mr Campbollhadtoldthemhewasin favour of every kind of liberal measure that had been before the House, that he would not disturb them that he was, if possible, in favour of giving even a more liberal construction to the Land law He would support the Public Schools Act in the fair and impartial administration! i of it. He was favourable to free trade, and had told the that he was disposed to consider measures calculated to give employment to the youth of the colony, which was a matter of great importance If Mr Campbell professed all those principles and Mr AVearno followed much in the same line, they had to choose between two gentlemen offer- ing very much the same principles, and perhaps it might come to be a matter of consideration on personal grounds It had been suggested that Mr. Campbell was brought forward by some persons who wished to have a tool He (Mr Cowper) at any rate did not wish for an) tool He had no work of the kind to do. The gentleman who proposed Mr AVearno had much more need for a tool He (Mr Cowper), in times past, had served them faithfully, but had now retired from the business of politics He came forward to day to perform an act of gratitude to the memory of discovered friend and their honoured servant, the late Robert Campbell (Continued cheering ) He now proposed the son of that gentleman William Robert Campbell, as a fit and proper person to represent the elec stocks of West Sydney (Cheers ) chair W B DALI Ex came forward, amid much cheering, to second the nomination of Mr Campbell He said, thirteen years ago-a space of time so short and of one that embraces our whole history of Responsible Government with its countless changes-its heart-aches-its failures and its successes thirteen years ago there was one man representing this city in Parliament, whose character was a combination of every quality that goes to make up what all men agree to designate by the word gentleman (Applause) Truthful, honourable, courageous, careful of the sensibilities of others, most generous having given man) things, health, fortune, and many wordly advantages, he at last gave his life to his fellow countrymen (Cheers) Such (continued Mr, Dalke)) was he whose friendship I was privileged to enjoy from the first moment I know him, until he was laid in the grave-such a man was Robert Campbell (Applause) The candidate whose nomination he had the honour to second was the son of the man whose name he had mentioned B) that circumstance alone he had a loft) title to their support for the services of patriots should be remembered in behalf of their children, and the debt of honour to the parent, which death prevented them from discharging, should be paid to the sea (Cheers, and some tokens of disapprobation ) He might say with a great man of our own times in proposing the son of an illustrious patriot,-" His father s mjago walks before him, and when a moan idea could enter his bent the must be possessed of a boldness in infamy beyond the share of moderate degeneracy). If then it be asked what security exists for his parliamentary conduct, I will answer his name ' (Cheers ) Mr Campbell came before them with two guarantees for his future He had the obligation of his father's history to bind him to an honourable course, and he was proposed for your acceptance by his ("Mr Dalley) a) friend Charles Cowper-the most unselfish, the ablest, and, he believed in his soul, the honest public servant who over hope (Applause ) "*JMr~-DitAi, si BELL said he was waited upon by a deputation some time ago to stand for Canterbury, but as the general election was so near, and such an old and highly respected colonist as Mr Richard Hill was in the field, he thought it was not advisable to have a contest He stated, however, that whenever an election for West Sydney took place he would be a candidate, and in accordance with that premise he now appeared before them. He did not appear before them with a flourish of trumpets and with the support of ex-Colonial Secretaries and Premiers, but he stood here, as Mr Folkes said, a tub on his own bottom (laughter) and he asked them to vote for the best man. The ballot was given them to put a stop to bribery and corruption Under the Electoral Act, moreover, it was not necessary for any man to have a property qualification, although he possessed a qualification if it were required There was another thing he had complain of, and that was the Press of this colony. The Press appeared to take sides He had not been reported as he ought to have been rry 01 ted at length (Loud laughter ) And he had no hesitation in saying that the Press did not do its duty He should therefore take up much longer time than be otherwise should, as he was determined that his opinions should go forth to the world There was no doubt of Um rcfpcclollhty of the other cumulates Mr G Campbell came from one of the most respectable families in the land, and it was shocked at a remark made by Mr Parkes, in the MOFOUIC Hall, on last 1 Friday night, Mr Parkes said he liked a man, who, if he married a wife, would stick to her A\ hat right had he, for a political purpose, to drag the domestic and social life of a young man before the public, and try by innuendo to injure another candidate i Mr Parkes himself married a wife the Formosans his servants wore his workmen, and did he stick to them ' (No) , Again, Mr Parkes on Friday night, said he did not like to see the landmarks of party destroyed, but he was followed by Mr Speer and Mr Wearne, both of whom said they were not party men, but Mr Parkes supported Mr Wearne nevertheless there must be inconsistency somewhere A\ hat had been the conduct of the late Ministry ? One body in the community the Catholics had been treated shame fully by the late M ministry, and as lintons they ought not to have suffered it It was thought there were some 1 enians, but had they found any í Had Mr Parkes found the myth the ghost that he raised (a laugh ) But the papers had been abstracted The Catholics here had home the slain, but they would not have suffered it in Manchester or Birmingham, in Leeds or London He must say one word about O Burrell, who was launched into eternity very quickly One man near Goulburn committed the murders, and was allowed to live several months, but this unfortunate madman, O 1 arrell-(tho remainder of the sentence was lost in a storm of groans and hisses) He (Mr Drans- field was not a Roman Catholic, he was a member of St Barnabas Church, but he liked fair play [The speaker gave some particulars of O Farrell s family, and stated that they were highly respectable] He now came to the Protestant Politic in Association, which was got up by Davis, at the instigation of Tiger Co of the rules of the Association was that no Roman Catholic should hold Municipal or Legislative honours A\ as that fair and just (No) There were seven Roman Catholics in the Legislature, and three in the Municipal Chi nil r, it the body was not represented fairly Svhnt privileges, then, had been given to them by 1 Protestants He thought these associations for breeding dissensions for pe litical purposes were doing a great deal of harm (Cries of time) There was time enough He was master of the position, and he meant to keep it till he had said all he wanted to At the last general election, when Mr. Edgar was defeated, Mr Parkes gave us a little doggie, and it was as follows " Good electors pity me My body's bent and measure, | I'm in the Australian Olmlntouc now, But simply Betsy Eagar " (Laughter) This was the doggrel composed by this great and talented 2 men, Mr Parkes Since that they had been in the same Cabinet together, and certain cheques had passed between them It appeared that on the 25th of April, 1866, he received £150 from the lroaBury,and promised to give vouchers within two or three months. On the 21st May he received another £100, which was placed to the credit of his private account in the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank Mr Parkes was a commercial man the mail was about to go, and he wanted the money On the 23rd October he received another sum of 296 8s, making altogether £518 8s and the vouchers given were for £332 19s 8d , leaving a deficit (on account of secret service of £21 Was that secret service in his own pocket? It was a question with him (Mr Dransfield) whether it was not On one occasion he took a trip to the southward, and spent £109 12s 10d inthieodajs He afterwards went to the westward for a day or two, and spent £28, and he went to Melbourne, and spent £117 If they liked toboiobbcd in this way, he would say no more about it Surely they had a right to some explanation Iron there was the expenses of the special trains at 26 each, for taking him home to his own door at night The late Ministry also gave a picnic at Marulan, which cost the country £278, and the wine that was left was put into Byrnes s cellar in order that the other Ministers might go up there and enjoy them selves and say " what ROOTS the public With regard to Mr Duncan he thought it was a wrong thing to dismiss such an old public servant, and he thought he should be re- instated in order that he might get an allowance from the Superannuation Fund Otherwise they would have to give him a pension out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund OH for his own opinions If the Upper House were necessary at all he would have it elective, and have one third of the members to retire every third year, but he thought the time VYOB not far distant when they would have a fete at senate composed of representatives from all the Australian colonies (Hear, hear) He was in favour of triennial parliaments, and opposed to members being sent back to their constituents upon their acceptance of office He thought the public should have a voice in the appointment of magistrates Just beef re a general election a new batch of magistrates were gi petted, and very frequently the men appointed were very bad fit for the duties He was also in favour of retrenchment wherever possible Mr Forster introduced a bill to decentralise the Government that certain extent and as a first step to that object he (Mr Dransfield) was in favour of municipal districts and district boards, these Boards to appoint the magistrates and a] point and pay the clerks of petty sessions constabulary, even in their respective districts They should also have charge of the minor roads, bridges etc and this would re- leave the central Government of between £300,000 and £100,000 per annum the central Government would, of c urge, "hav to subsidise these district councils for the first three or four years He was in favour of funding the public debt In the event of a European war which would break out some day and three or four enemy s ships of war in the He is our debentures, as at present issued, would not be worth £50 each Perhaps they would not be saleable at any price The present would be in good time for funding the debt when our debentures would sell for 95 of 100 instead of 84, the price they were at some time ago He was in favour of National Bank of issue and deposit Mr Eagar advocated a bank of issue only There were at present in the banks of the colony deposits to the amount of £5,000 000 and these banks were all liable to failure Some of them commenced entirely on credit, and they were now paying handsome dividends The issue of notes by the banks of the colony was close upon £"00,000, and why should not the colony at large have the benefit of this instead of its being more ported by private individuals Those vi be put their money in the banks would expect sovereigns in return, but the whole of the banks only hold £2 150 000, to meet liabilities of £7,400 000 They hold in bullion £13 5,000, and there was, therefore, a deficit of about to 000 000 Where viss this gold sent to Home for clothing, meat drink, Ale and other goods that could be produced in this colony In this way the money went home, and the clothing and other goods came out, instead of erecting manufactories where coming generations would find employment (Cries of " Time, time ) He had no time, but he was getting hoarse, and must soon come to a termination He was also in favour of protection to some extent [An Elects "To what extent' ] All articles of clothing and luxury that could be produced here he would place a duty on, but all goods that could not be produced here he would let in free £2 We have had enough that ] Therowasnominiigrationnow, normal thing for the people to do 'vAhoncvci he wrote home to the large manufacturing towns at home he always told the people not to come out here as there was nothing for them to do But immigration must be induced by some means He recently saw a paragraph reprinted from the Melbourne Age, in which the good effects of a 10 per cent duty on certain imported goods in that colony were set forth The revenue was in a satisfactory state, the colony was making good progress, and some of the gaols were being converted into schools If we had a protective policy here our gaols might be converted into schools He was in favour of the best education that could be given the children, but employment must be found for them on the gaols would still be full Ihcnd valorem duties had proved a curse to the colony Mr Cowper was pressed into adopting them at a time when he could not help himself but they had done a great deal of injury to the mercantile houses of this city who pass their invoices fairly and honestly There was a good deal of talk about free trade absolutely, and if there was a probability of sufficient revenue being obtained by means of property and income he would go in for it He would also extend always, because they tended to cheapen the necessaries of life, and they employed a large amount of labour Robertson s Land Act had been a great boon to the country but it required to be still more liberal He would reduce the price of land to be an acre, and would give free grants to immigrants and native born (Cries of "Time ) ^¡thavicw to supplying the city with plenty of water he would have a canal two chains in width, cut from the Nepean This would give employment to 2000 men for two v cars and would cost about £S00,000 There would there then be sufficient water for the city for all times for manufacturing and every other purpose He was in favour of a public library, but was opposed to State aid except in some exceptional cases With regard to education he was in favour of the present Public Schools Act, but he thought it required some little modification (2 Cries of no, no ). He now thanked them for the patient hearing they his given him, and he hoped they would behave of themselves equally well to the other candidates (Laughter ) Mr Jc-Eni W EARNE, amid enthusiastic cheers, then advanced to address the electors He was glad to be able to state that he was not here to oppose Mr Gampboll As having been first in the hold, Mr Campbell came out to oppose him [Mr Dransfield to oppose both of us that a light be, but it seemed very likely that the contest would be narrowed to one between Mr. Campbell and himself (Mr Wearne) The fa your able hearing he had always obtained he attributed to his endeavour to say what he had to state in a few words and as plainly as possible, s0 that all could understand The views he had expressed were his own, whether they accorded with the views of Mr Pat lies or those of any other person, and if Mr Robertson had a majority in the House (which he did not think he had he would support honors long as he retained it, and did what he (Mr Wearne) thought right He did not come out under Mr Parkes's water ices, but had a large support I before that gentleman added his to it. He might state that he had not had a fact so well known as Mr Campbell s still he had one of whom he might justly feel proud if he did not leave of him a "splendid fortune he was a man of principles that were worth all the money that could be bequeathed to I (Mr Wearne) had independent principles of his wife that he inherited from his father, what had all the British pluck I to stick to them (Cheers ) In reference to the Land 2-- v . .
