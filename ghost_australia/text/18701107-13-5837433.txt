SUMMARY EOll EUROPE. f Continued from t?ie Supplement to The Argus of this day.) NEW ZEALAND NOTES. The war, though " stamped out" for the present, is evidently not yet at an end. The friondly natives have not yet succeeded in catching To Kooti. Tho accounts of their various expeditions, which have reached us from time to time, have all had one refrain, "A great victory, but Te Kooti again escaped." Latterly, whilst various bodies of natives, some under native and some under European leadership, have boen scouring the Uriwera country, capturing old women, and accepting the surrender of half-starved Hauhaus, Te Kooti, with such following as he still retains, has always been at somo other place where nobody went to seek him, although it'would appear ho never attempted to leave his hiding-place to which he retreated at the beginning of the winter. With the return of spring, he appears to have emorged from his retreat, and was heard of at Lake \Y oikare moana, with 100 men, in the beginning of ? September. It was further reported that ho had gone off to Tokangamutu to seo the ,_ing. He is not short of ammunition or sup- plies, and if the number of men reported to bo with him is not very great, it doe3 not fall very far short of that with which ho com .menced his career of rapine and murder little more than two years ago. Scarcoly had this unwelcome information become known, when the little community of New Plymouth, which has for so many years "lived in the midst of alarms," was startled out of such sense of security as a year's peace ¿ad made to creep over it, by the news that Tito Kowaru had passed with an armed fol- lowing within three miles of the town, on his way to tho native meeting at Pariaka. When this was reported by telegraph from Nelson, the Government very promptly despatched some 40 men of the armed constabulary, who were taken round to Taranaki in H.M S. Blanche. Thus England's "last ship" (in theso waters) fulfilled Lord Granville's pro- mise, without waiting for the dangor from without which was to havo been the con- dition precedent of such help. This prompti- tude was probably very valuable. The fact that a Queen's ship conveyed the reinforce- ments would, no doubt, bo quickly known amongst the natives throughout the district. If mischief was browing, this show of pre- paredness would be quite enough to put a stop to it, or at least to postpone it. It does not appear, howover, that any attack was contemplated, and a considerable portion of the forco despatched in the Blanche has since roturned to Wellington. The news that Tito Kowaru had passed within sight of New Plymouth, with 80 armed men in his train, proved to bo perfectly correct. He passed south to the scene of his old victories and defeats, and made a sort of sentimental journey to the various places whore his com- rades fell. On the sixth day of the Pariaka meeting he made his appearance there. Ho was received with loud cries of welcomo, as befitted the occasion whon so great a patriot made a public entry into the kainga of his friends, the wholo crowd of those natives who played the hosts at this meeting going out to meet him waving branohei of trocs over their heads. On his arrival at the village, he and Mr. Parris, civil commissioner of Her Majesty's Government in Now Zea- land, spent an hour or two in rating one another soundly, and then everybody went to dinner. Tho next day Tito Kowaru intimated to To Whiti his royal pleasure. He had come to know what all tho talk had been about. This ascertained, he expressed his contempt of Te Whiti's proceedings ; declared his in tcntionnot to attack anybody unless raolestod, but to retaliate if his face was scratched ; and went away. That Tito Kowaru and his can- nibal bordo should thus havo boldly marched through the province of Taranaki, and met the representativos of tho Government in the village of a. so-called friendly tribe, where, aftor abusing the commissioner to his heart's content, ho snaps his fingers in that official's face, and ilings at his head the announcement, "If ray faco is scratched I will rctaliato," is a mystery quito inexplicable to persons at a distance. It is an cvidonco of weakness on the part of the Govornmont, which may at any moment lead to very seriousconscquences. Tbo garrison of New Plymouth, before Tito Kowaru made his appearance on the scone, was 17, and it has since been increased to about double that number.* Iho total effective force of the militia of tho Province of Tara- naki is 7L Had Tito Kowaru been disposed for a raid on New Plymouth, there is every Toasou to boliovo that ho might have burnt the town, helped himself to a good store of ammunition, and returned quietly home' with very littlo damage to his force. Tho meeting at Pariaka, which brought Mr. Parris and Tito Kowaru faco to face, appears' to have been a fiasco. Te Whiti is it man of some influence among tho natives, and his summons appears to have boon freely responded to, His manifesto was-'" Taranaki began the war, aud Taranaki must end it." But when it carno to the point, it appeared ' that To Whiti's idea of ending the war was thus embodied-" King no good, Queen no good-To Whiti is tho only man who has cared for his people." When Tito Kowaru asked him who . was behind him, i.e., who would suppoit his protonsions, ho replied, " There is one Fathor, one Son, and one Holy Ghost ; altogether theso are three -yes, they aro three, yet aro but ono ; and that is I !" It is hardly to bo wondered at that Tito Kowaru should havo exclaimed contemptu- ously of tho meeting, " Your talk-what is there in it?-I don't seo the end." Pariaka, where the meeting took placo, lies between Mount Egmont and tho soa, a fovv miles from the cape usually named after that mountain, but known locally as West Cape. It is described by an intelligent correspondent of a local newspaper as a sort of rofugofor na- tive vagabonds, who fly there " for safety when any crimo has been committed ;" and whore "tho greatest ruffians feel themselves secure, and defy tho European civil authorities'to molest them." Tito Kowaru, it appears, did not return from Pariaka meeting so peaceably at he said ho would. Ho is stated to havo robbed somo friondly natives at Opunako of GO sheep These he refused to return, and the friendlies accordingly went in pursuit of thom, but vvoio driven back by an armed force of tho rebels. Tho friendlies wcro very angry, and hold a meeting, at which thoy said that they had causo for fighting. The Europeans, howover, prevented their following the nau-haus to fight them, and, Tito Kowaru ultimately, through fear of bein« attacked, left tho sheop, with the oxcoption of 10 that had been eaton. It is reported that To Kooti's followors aro leaving him, and straggling away in the direc- tion of tho coast, their object being to escapo observation. Four ox-Chatham island pri- soners-Rewi, his wifo, a young lad, and Knaro,. who was formerly transported for selling powder to the Hau-haus- had come in to Wairoa. Itowi states that To Kooti's fol- lowers number 300, while Knaro sets thom down at 40 only. It is reported that To Whaiu, having lost 120 mon by fovor, is anxious to surrender, and that Te Kooti is insane ; but this wants confirmation. Three shocks of earthquake wero felt at "Wellington on the 3rd Octobor, and an earth- quake occurred at Nelson on tho samo day. Archdeacon Hadfield was consocratod bishop of Wellington on Octobor 9. The %vbolo of tho bishops in tho colony woro pro sent nt the ceremony. This is tho first epis- copal consecration ever performed without tho Queen's mandato, and Mr. Kempthorno, of Auckland, entered a protest against it on that account. Tho attempt to make tho Otago University a colonial institution, has, for tho present, fallon through, Appointments to the classical and mathematical chairs havo been made. In neither caso has any candidate already in tho colonies been successful, It appears that more blunders in the hasty legislation of last session aro turning up. lu regard to tho hitch about tho collection of the gold duties, it is stated that, in reply to tho offer by tho banks to pay tho now duties from tho 1st of Octobor, the Govornmont maintain that the intention of the Logislaturo wai that \ ? t TIates fmoula romaiu in forco until the Mt ot January.

B *mcndl»ent of the arid The reunion of Otago and Southland took placo on the Gth October. X serious charge is mndo by 'several of tho Now Zealand papers against tho Ge- neral Government of tampering in an un- warrantable manner with tho telegrams which contained tho news brought by the Suez mail. Tho statcmont is that tho tele crams sent from the Bluff to the various papers which havo combined their telegraphic ar- rangements, wero transmitted to Wellington, and wero tliero divulged by a member of the Government to tho Independent, a Minis- terial organ. This journal, although not one of tho telegraphic association, was still enabled to publish telegrams which woro tho legitimate propeiiy of the pipers thus evii bmed. It is stated that an action u abiiu to oe instituted agaiiiat the Government by the associated press. A most disastrous fire occurred at Lyttelton on the night of October 21 ; ic raged for up ward3 of four hours. Two-thirds of the town have been laid in ruins, and a large number of families rendered houseless. The lossc were estimated at £100,000. The cause of the fire is unknown. Splendid crushings are reported from several of the claims at Coromandel. The yield of the Shotover claim, at the Thames, for Sep- tember last, was l,500oz. Tho Caledonian Company'^ first crushing produced 215o/:. ldwt. of gold from about 00 tons of stone. - The Golden Crown Reef had also been cut in the shaft of the Tookey Company. ¡ Tho genoral elections aro proceeding. A, seat had been offered to Sir George Grey, but his name being omitted from the electoral rolls prevented his acceptance. Mr. Vogel, stands for Auckand ; and after the elections are ovor he will probably go home to negotiate the new loan. COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. THE MAILS. The P. and O. Company's R.M.S.S. Geelong reached Hobson's Bay, from Sydney, on the night of the 10th October, and, after shipping her mails, gold, and specie, and embarking her passengers, took her departure, on her outward voyage, on the afternoon of the 11th ult., at 2 o'clock. The P. and O. Company's R.M.S.S. Avoca, in command of Captain A. B. Farquhar, arrived in the "bay about half -past -1 p.m. on tho 25th ult. from Galle, with the mails from England and the East. As usual, the Avoca proved herself quite equal to her provious achievements in the matter of quick voyag- ing, and on the presont trip she so far ex- ceeded punctuality that she landed her mails nearly two days and a half before contract time. Her run from the Sound to Hobson's Bay was performed in 124 hours, although she had to steam cautiously through a thick fog from Cape Otway to the Heads. The Avoca left Gallo at twenty-five minutes past 11 a.m. on the 4th ult., and orrived at the Sound at 1 a.m. on the 20th. She left again the same day at noon. Cape Otway was pawed at 7 a.m. on the 25th, the Heads being entered at ten minutes to 2 p.m. On arrival the mails were landed with their customary despatch, and their transit to the General Post-office was also speedily accomplished. She left for Sydney again shortly after G o'clock, but in her run round was singularly unlucky. On leaving this port the Avoca ran into the brigantine Challenger, and sank her, and afterwards intelligence was received by tele- gram that on arriving at Sydnoy she ran down the steamer Waimea. Fortunately, no lives were lost in either collision. The City of Melbourne, with the Califor- nian mails outward, left Sydney for Auck- land on her voyago to Honolulu punctually at 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 31st ult. STATE OF TRADE. Dulness and depression continue promi- nent features in trade, and our business pros- pects arc still very far from bright. On many provious occasions we have pointed out how dependent we have been and still aro upon a favourable change in tho weather for the im- provement so much wanted, and not uniea conably so, considering the advanced state of tho season ; but, as if to taunt us with the hopes thatmay bocreated by a few fine days, an alteration takes place, a deluge of rain sets in, and we are once moro with blighted prospects, back in the middle of winter. On the last and provious opportunity, when writing congratu- lations on being favoured with an appearance of fine wcathor, the rains on each occasion set in, which dissipated our hopes, but beyond that we could not point to any positive lost. ; it is very different, however, on t he present, the rains which commenced a week ago, though continuing only for a couple of days, having caused a flood which has resulted in the loss of life as well as the destruction of property, creating a wide- spread consternation over all the country. From all quarto« accounts have beeh leceived of the losses which have been suffered, and few of the principal town/i in the interior have oscaped from the disustious effects of this calamitous visitation.. Under these circumstances a cheerful leport of the market can hardly be expected. The mails from Europe were waited for this time with intense anxiety and impatience; and considerable disappointment was caused by the non-arrival of the Californian mail to time, which, though only bring- ing telegraphic advices from London to 11th September, did not reach Syd- ney till tho day before the Suez mails, with dates by telegraph to 5th October, reached Adelaide ; and the letters by the latter route carno to hand before those by the former arrived hcie. Wool has come forward moro freely ; and immediately on receipt of advices, the banks resolved to lower tbe rate of exchange. Transactions during the month havo been, generally speaking, of a minor character, and no speculative operations of any descrip- tion havo been recorded. In Dundee goods consideiablo attention has been drawn to- wal ds cornsacks, leading to several hundred bales changing hands. Candles havo been quite neglected, the only sales effected having gouo through the auction mart. In coffee, tho arrival of tho _ Woodcote, with 100 tons, only requires notico. In breadstuffs and likewiso feeding moins, a moderato business has bcon done. Tho sales of sugars aggregate 34,400bags and mats, and embrace tho cargoes of tho Oriental, Witch, Sea Nymph, Eva Joshua, and several parcels of Bourbon de- scriptions. The public sales of teas amount to 19,000 or 14,000 packages, tho prin- cipal being 3,843 packages last season's teas congous ex Corypheus, 7,133 pack ages new congous ex Boy Bendixen, be- sides 1,500 packages fancy teas ex Joshua Bates, and other small parcels. Tho timber sales meludo deals per Hydaspes, two cargoes of Canadian spruco deals and lumber, and other shipments of American timber. In tobacco transactions havo not been large, but the morket has not been so healthy for years past. Wines aud spirits have been little dealt in. From Lyttelton, Now Zealand, accounts havo been received of a most disastrous con- flagration in that town, by which property to the extent of £100,000 has boen totally de- stroyed. Anothor trade-mark prosecution has been brought forward by Mpssrs. Geo. Martin and Co., as agents for Blood, Wolfe, and Co.; but having failed in proving that tho labels ob- jected to had been attached to tho bottles at Clancey's brewery (the placo of the dofondant referred to), or that ho knew of their being so affixed, the case was dismissed, with £2 2s. costs. Amongst the bank meetings held in the courso of the month, that of tho National calls for somo notice, owing to the circum stanco that notwithstanding the fact of the directors' leport on tho previous occasion having shown losses to tho extent of £80,000, yet at tho present time thoy are again unablo to recommend the payment of a dividend, the whole of tho net profit, amounting to £30,57-1, besides a further sum of £3,440, being required to próvido against all and ovory contingency on bad debt account. So unpleasant a state of matters has led to the resignation of the chairman and directors. It speaks well, how ever, for our colonial banking institutions that one of our youngest banks should be ina position to provide for losses to the extent of £130,000, and yet havo a reserved fund of £182,000, besides its capital of £000,000 in- tact. It is a matter for congratulation that there is not the slightest appearance of want of confidence in commercial circles, notwith- standing that the month has not been free from insolvencies. Messrs. George Lewis and Co., coal mer- chants and shipping agents, have made an assignment of their estate. At the meeting of creditors held it was shown that the liabili- ties amounted to about £16,000, of which about £10,000 was said to be secured. It is feared that the unsecured creditors will fare badly. Mr. Robert Caldwell, of Footscray, near Melbourno, squatter and merchant, has been compelled to place his estate in tho Insolvont Court. The causes of insolvency aro stated to bo losses on sheop station at Queensland occasioned by tho drought and subsequent Hood, and by the fall iu the price of wool, those losses combined amounting to about £10,000 ; losses of about £3,000 on shipments to other countries, and loss of about £15,000 in badi debts.

' ' A meeting of tho creditors of Messrs. llor witz and Jacoby, drapers. &c..; Hamilton, was held ort tho 22nd Octobor, in tho rooms of Messrs Ella and Co. accountants. Tho staif nient prepared by Mr. Ell.i «bowed liabiliti'-s amounting to £13,008, of which amount £3,900 was secured. The assets, including those held by tho secured creditors, wero esti- mated at£12,G50, leaving a deficiency of £418. It was unanimously agreed to assign the estate to Messrs. Sherrard and Watson. In the estate of Messrs. Guild, Chapman, and Co., warehousemen, Sydnoy and Ade- laide, made bankrupt in London, with lia- bilities amounting to £93,720. and assets estimated at £72,582, -we understand that Messrs, Ljrell and Gowan, of this city, havo been appointed to act for the official receiver in the estate. The creditors aro almost en- tirely British. From Sydney we leam that the creditors of the Hon. Henry Parkes having decided that his estate shall bo wound up in the Insolvent Court, he has filed his schedule. The balance sheet in the estate shows-liabilities, £36,000; assets, £13,000 ; deficiency, £23,000. EXCHANGE AND MOSEY. The exchango rate has been reduced this month to l.J per cent, for 00 days' sight, bank drafts on London 2 per cent, for 30 days, and 2.J por cent, on demand. Interest and dis- count rates show no alteration whatever ; 2 per cent, per annum is allowed on one month's deposits, 4 per cent, on three, and D por cent, on six months. Tho banks cou tinuo to charge a uniform rato of 0 per cent, on bills having two months', 7 per cent, on three months', and 8 per cent, on bills of four months' currency. WOOL. A good deal of interest was centred in the present season's opening sales of wool, the first of which was held on the afternoon of the 2nd inst., at Messrs. Goldsbrough and Co.'s stores. Tho attendance of merchants, buyers, &c;, was very large-larger, indeed, than on former occasions. The biddings proved spirited and full of animation. A great portion of the lots disposed of wero purchased on English account, and much better prices were realised than, under exist- ing circumstances, could havo been expected. The number of bales submitted to competi- tion was not so extensive as doubtless ?will be tho case as the season progresses-1,543 bales altogether wero offered, consisting of clips in oidinary to average condition, and 1,068 bales found buyers at 5d. to 7¿d. for greasy, 94d. to lOAd. for handwashed, 12d. to loj¡«d- for scoured, and lid. to 13Ad. for fleece. At the second sale of the season, held on Friday, the 4th inst., 1,000 bales were offered, consisting of Murrumbidgee clips. The biddings for the larger lots not coming up to sellers' views, they were passed in for further instructions, and only 170 bales were disposed of, at prices which were considered satisfactory. Greasy realised 6d. to 7Jd. ; scoured, 12d, to 14}d. ; and medium lleece, 12d, to 14d. STOCK AND STATIONS. Tho Pastoral Times of 29th ult. states re- garding station property:-"The extraordi- nary season continues unchanged, save that the weather is still more extraordinary heavy rains, thunderstorms, with vivid Hashes of lightning, and great heat prevail. In Riverina, millions of acres of grass, vary- ing in height from one to six feet, could be mown ; sheep are often buried in the high grasses, and cattle aro half hidden in thura. Never before was known such a season-a loan beast is scarcely seen. The wan t now is of store stock to eat up the grasses and herbage, but, 'thin partitions' divide storo stock from fat, Even cattle sold recently a9 stores in a neighbouring district have been sent from near Deniliquin to Melbourno, whore they fetched good prices. As a sample of our first class fat stock, a neighbouring squatter, Mr. Gilbort, of Warwillah, furnished us with a hill of his sale last week at Geelong by Messrs. Bowes and Buckland, from which we extract the following:-"One cow £15, one heifer £10 10s., five wethers (at 27s.) £6 IS*,, five ewes (at 17s.) £45s. ' The sheep werehalf-bredLeicosters. Torrents of rain fell in tho north last week. The hailstones were so formidable in and around Dubbo, that in their descent they tore fhe bark off young trees. All the accounts of the wool clip aro most favourable from the gi eat saltbush country from the Murray to Queensland. It is stated that iti3many years sinco the average character, condition, and growth of New South Wales wool has been so satisfactory as the clip of 1869-70. Wo do not lemember to havo seen during any for mor season such a numbor of free, sound, woll-grown, brightly-washed Hocks. In some parts of theso districts the fleeces are fully one-third heavier than they wero ever before known ; the fine wools are longer, stronger, and finer than in many past seasons, and tho whole of the clip is expected to realise fully one-third more than it has for any one season for the last fivo years. Tho country throughout the Mitchell, "Warrego, und Maranoa districts looks beautiful ; it is abundantly supplied with water and long and luxuriant fattening grasses of every de- scription, while largo herds of cattle and largo flocks of sheep from Queensland aro travelling lownids the Sydney and Melbourne markets. At liockhampcon, during the last few weeks, theoe had hecn almost a stagnation in town tradevbut stock and station matters are lively, inquiry both forstoie sheep and cattle being much on the increuso."

BANKS AND PUBLIC COMPANIES. Colonial Bank of Australasia.-The 28th half-yearly meeting Was held on che 18th October, the Hon. B. Cohen in the chair, The report presented set out that-" The net prouts, after deducting expenses of manage- ment, repairs to premises, rebate on bills current, and allowance for bad and doubtful debts, amount to (including the balance from Inst half-year) £20,S73 19s. oil., which the directors propose to apportion as follows, viz. : -Dividend at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum, £17,500 ; reserve fund, £2,000 ; balance carried to profit and loss-new ac- count, £7,373 19s. Sd. The chairman re- marked that the last half-year had been a trying one, and, like similar institutions, the Colonial Bank had not escaped losses. Tho whole of theso losses, however, had been taken out of the profits for tho half-year, and were fully provided for. Tim bank was now in os sound and prosperous a condition as any in Victoria. The report and balance-sheet were adopted, and a vote of thanks given to the directors and oflieera of the bank for the efficient way in which they had performed their duties during the past half-year. , National Bank of Australasia.-The twelfth nalf-yeaily meeting was held on the 1st No- vember; Sir Francis Murphyin the chair. The directors had again to present an unsatisfac- tory report. Tho net profits for the half-year came to £30,103 30s., and with £1,411 03. Id., recovered from bad debts, woro proposed to be transferred to bad debt account. Id was to be gathered from the chairman's statement that the sum of £SO,O0O, approximated from the net profits and the bad debt account at the last half-yearly meeting, had proved in- sufficient by £10,000 to meot the losses arising upon accounts then investigated. There was a further loss of £11,000, which ought to have been provided for upon the former occasion, but was not, in consequence of the lato manager omitting to place before the board some correspondence which he had in his hands, but which probably he did not estimate according to its importance. Again, bad debts, amounting to £8,000, belonging to the various branches, had now to bo pro- vided for, but were not reported upon to the directors at tho time by tho late managur. In addition to these items, losses to the amount of ¿5,000 had accrued during the present half-year, the wholo mounting up to a sum which equallesd the balonce to credit of profit and loss, and about £3,400 besides. It vías stated that the branch at Camperdown (Victoria) was closed on tho 1st October, and that the branch at Carngham was to be closed on the 1st November. When the adoption of the report had been moved and seconded, Captain Coffey moved a.resolution «flhining that tho interests of the bank re- quired that the directors shall resign. This led to an explanation by the chairman, who frankly admitted that his want of training in themeicantile and banking business had obliged him to put great dependence on the statements laid before him by the officers of the bank. Withont any resolution of the kind now proposed, he was quite ready to resign. Mr, Sutheiland and Mr. Martin, also directors, spoke to tho same effect; and on its being intimated that the board gene- rally (with tho exception of Sir James Palmer, who had already resigned) were prepared to retire, the meeting was adjourned to the 0th December, in order that steps might be taken to convene a special meeting for the same day to elect a new board of directors. Bank of New South Wales.-The 40th half Aearly meeting was held at Sydney on the '26th ult. The directors presented a less favourable report than usual. The protracted state of extremo depression which lind in- juriously affected the pastoral and other important industrial pursuits of the colonies had reduced the ordinary earnings of the bank, whilst at the same time the losses from bad debts had been unusually laigo ; besides this, the bank had suffered con- siderable losses of an exceptional charac ter, through the nealect and miscon- duct of some of its officers in New Zet- land. Towards covering these, the directors has had recourse to tho reserve fund, pro- vided expressly with a view to meot contin- gencies of this kind. That fund, however, after satisfying the claims thus made upon it, still amounts to the largo sum of £300,000. Having taken this course for the purpose of wiping out these losses, and all such debts as were of a doubtful character, the directors were in a position to assure the proprietors of the houndness of the bank's affairs. After providing for bad and doubtful debts, re- ducing tho valuation on bank promise,), &c;, there remained at the credit of profit and loss account a balanco of £52,431 103, of which £50,000 was appropriated to the pay- ment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum. The reports and financial state- ments were adopted. Melbourne Omnibus Company.-At the half-yearly meeting, on the 19th October, Mr. F. B. Clapp in the chair, a dividend at the rule of 10 per cent, per annum was declared. The net profits for the six months ending Septe-mbcr 30 carne to £1,775, of which the. dividend absorbed £025 ; £500 was devoted to deputation in rolling-stock, £200 to pre liminaiy expenses, and the balance, £450, cal ried to a new profit and loss account. Warrenheipüistillery Company.-An extra oiditiary meeting was held on the 21st Oc- tober, relative to the proposed wind ing-up of the company, Hr. S, P, Lord in the chair. The directors recommended that the manu- facture of spirits should be stopped for the present, expenses cut down to a minimum, and stocks reduced ns speedily and advan- tageously as possible, with a view to lessoning liabilities and bringing tho concern into smaller compass, when the directors would consider whether the company could be made to pay. The liability to the bank was stated to be £12,000 ; and an additional £5,000 was secured by mortgage. After somo discussion, during which a motion was submitted for winding tho company up voluntarily, an amendment, in terms of the directors' leeom mendation, was carried by 14 to 8. Langlands Foundry Company.-Tho'half yearly meeting was held on the 27th ult., tho lion. C. J. Jenner in the chair. A fall- ing off in the quantity of work done during tho past six months to tho extent of £5,170, as compared with the previous half-year, was reported. Nevertheless, tho balance to credit of profit and loss amounted to £1,599 9á. 9,1. A steam-hammer and other new appliances were to bo erected. The company had ob- tained the contract for the bridge work of a portion of the North-Eastoin Railway, and the manager had been sent to Great Britain to make arrangements for part of tho work to be executed there. The report and balauce sheet were adopted, and Messrs. Joseph Wilkie and Andiew Lyell re-elected director*. Polynesia Company.-An ordinary meotim; was held 011 tho 28th October, Mr. A. K. Smith in the chair. Owing to the balance sheet not having been audited, through the absence of ono auditor from Melbourne, the meeting was adjourned for a month. Before the adjournment took place, however, n dis- cussion arose upon reports received from the special commissioner and the committee in Fiji. The Inst instalment of tho American debt bad been paid. Mr. flutters (the special commissioner) considered the paymont ill advised, as King Thakombau had not com- pleted tbo conveyance of tho lands ; but the committee reported that thero -was no help for it, on account of Mr, Butters not keeping nn appointment with the Ameiican consul. Tbo original surveyors of tho company wrote a letter complaining that tho land set apart for them had been " jumpod" by tho commit- tee. At the present timo the affairs of the company seem perplexed. Mutual Assurance Society of Victoria.-A meeting of the projectors was held on tho 15th ult., Mr. G. Martin presiding. Tho exe- cutive committee reported that the numbor of 100 foundation policies had been sub- scribed for, and tho basis of articles of associa- tion agreed upon. Tho general body of the subscribers were congratulated on the success which had attended the efforts of tho com- mittee to launch the society on "a broad, popular, and sound basis." The eloction of the first board of directors took place a week afterwards, when Messrs. George Martin, G. H. T. Webb, James Lorimer, H. Solwyn Smith, Robert M'Dougall, and A. H. M'Donnld wero appointed. To the diroctors was confided the duty of preparing tho working tables and appointment of officers. Victoria Bangor Slate Company.-The second general meeting was held on tho 4th November. It was reported by the directors that the lease of the ground had boon ob- tained ; and paving slate had been found in several places, and in one place traced for 200ft. The shareholders determined on in- creasing the capital to £4,000. Victoria Fishery Company.-At a meeting, held on the 4th, resolutions for the formation of this company were passed, and a provi- sional directory appointed, THE BANKS.
