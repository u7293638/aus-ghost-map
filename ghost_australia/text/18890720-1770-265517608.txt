THE cemetery just outside the Stads- BORT at Bergen, which had railed forth eager admiration of Blanche Morgan in the previous summer, looked perhaps OB, lovelier now that winter had come with its soft, white shroud. The trees, instead of their green leaves* stretched out rime-laden branches against the dear, rrosty sky; the crosses on the graves were fringedwith icicles, which, touched litre and there by the level rays of the setting sun, shone ruby-red, or in the shade gleamed clear as diamonds against the background of crisp white snow. Awav in raftdistance Ulnken reared his -rati! old head majestically, a dark 5ttMt precipitous rock showing out how and then through the veil which hid liis summer face; and to the right, in the valley, the prettY Lungegaarsvand was one great sheet of ice, over which skaters gKded merrily. The fcttdyof Sigurd Falck rested be- £de that of his wife in the midst of all »'life loveliness, and one winter afternoon Si<rid and little Swanhild came to bring to°the grave their wreaths and Crosses, for it was their father's birthday. They had walked from that uncle's bouse laden with all the flowers they had been «He to collect, and now stood at die gate cf the «metery, which opened stiffly owing to the frost. Sigrid looked older crd crth sadder than she had done in «JK firstshock of her father's death, but bttle Swanhild had just the same fair rosy face as before^ and there was a veiled excitement and camera ess in her manner as she pttshei at the cemetery-gate; she 1VSS ahte Vo take a sort of pleasure in bringing these birthday gifts, and even tad to her heart a keen satisfaction in Certainty that "Their grave" would look prettier than any of the others. No one else has remembered his birthday," she said, as they entered the silent graveyaid. "See, the snow is quite untrodden. Sigrid, when are they going to put father's name on the stone?" iiftd she pointed to the slanting marble slab whidi leant against the small cross. ''There is only mother's name still. Won't they put a bigger slab instead where there will be room for both ? " " Not now," said Sigrid, her voice trembling. " But why not, Sigrid ? Every one else las names put It seems as if we had forS5°tten him." " Oh, no, no," said Sigrid, with a sob. "It isn't that, darling; it is that we remember so well, and know what he would have wished about it." " I don't understand," said the child wistfully. " It is in this way," said Sigrid, taking her hand tenderly. "I cannot have money spent on the tombstone, because he would not have liked it Oh, Swanhild !—you must know it some day, you shall hear it now—it was not only his own money that was lost, it was the money of other people. And till it is paid back how can I alter this ?" Swanhild's eyes grew large and bright. " It was that, then, that made him die,'' she faltered. " He would be so sorry for the other people. Oh, Sigrid, I will be so good; I don't think I shall ever be naught)' again. Why didn't you tell me before, and then I shouldn't have been cross because you wouldn't buy me things f'' " 1 wanted to shield you and keep you from knowing," said Sigrid. " But after all, it is better that you should hear it from fflethan from some outsider." • " You will treat me like a baby, Sigrid, tad I'm ten years old after all—quite old fcflftilgh to be told things ... And oh you'll let me help to earn money and pay back the people, won't you ?" That is what Frithiof is trying to-do,' said Sigrid, " but it is so difficult and so slow. And I can't think of anything we can do to help." " Poor dear old Frithiof," said Swan Md. And she gazed away over the frrccn lake to the snow mountains which bounded the view, as if she would like to See rightthrough them into the big London shop where, behind a counter, there stood a fair-haired Norseman toiling bravely to pay off those debts of which she had just heard. " Why, on father's last two birthdays Frithiof was away in Germany, but then we were looking forward so to having him home again. There's nothing to look forward to now." Sigrid could not reply, for she felt choked. She stood sadly watching the child as she bent down, partly to hide her tears, partly to replace a flower which had slipped out of one of the wreaths. It was just that sense of having nothing to look forward to which had weighed so heavy on Sigrid herself all these months; she hid passed very bravely through all the troubles as long as there had been anything to do; but now that all the arrangements were made, the villa in Kalvedalen sold, the furniture disposed of, thenewhomeinherunde's housegrown familiar, her courage almost failed her, and each day she realized more bitterly how desolate and forlorn was their position. The first sympathetic kindness of her aunt and cousins had, moreover, had time to fade a little, and she became h'rowingly conscious that their adoption into the Gronvold family was an inconvenience. The house was comfortable but not too large, and the two sisters occupied the only spare room, so that it was no longer possible to have visitors. The income was fairly good, but times were hard, and even before their arrival Fru Gronvold had begun to practise a few little economies, which increased during the winter, and became more apparent to all the family. This was depressing enough ; and then, as Swanhild had said, there was nothing to which she could look forward, for Frithiofs prospects seemed to her altogether blighted, and she foresaw that all he was likely to cam for some time to come would only suffice to keep himself and could by no possibility support three people. Very sadly she left the cemetery, pausing again to struggle with the stiff hd gate, while Swanhild add the empty flower-baskets. "Can't you do it?" exclaimed the child. "What a tiresome gate it is ! worse to fasten than to unfasten. But see! here come the Lundgrens. They will help." Sigrid glanced round, blushing vividly as she met the eager eyes of Torvald Jjindgren, one of Frithiofs school friends. The greetings were frank and friendly on both sides, and Madale, a tall, pretty girl of sixteen, with her. hair braided into one long, thick plait, took little Swanhild's arm and walked on with her. " Let us leave those two to settle the gate between them," she said, smiling. It is far too cold to wait for them." Now Tohrald Lundgren was a year or two older than frjthiofj ang having long been u. > position of authority he was unusually old for his age. As a friend Sigrid liked him, but of late she had half feared that he wished to be more than a friend, and consequently she was not tdcn well pleased to see that, by the time the gate was actually shut, Madale and Swanhild were far in advance of them. " Have you heard from Frithiof yetfr" she asked, walking on briskly. "No," said Torvald. "Prty scold him well for me when you next write. How does he seem? In better spirits again?" " I don s tiknow," said Sigrid, "even to nite he writes very seldom. It is wretched having him so far away and not knowing what is happening to him." " I wish there was anything I could do for him," said' Torvald, " but there seems no chance of any opening out here m for him." " That is what my uncle says. Yet it was no fault of Frithiof s ; it seems hard that he should have to suffer. I think the ; world is very cruel You and Madale were almost the only friends who stood by us; you were almost the only ones who scattered fir branches in the road on the morning of my father's funeral." " You noticed that ? " he said, colourrng. "Yes; when I saw how little had been strewn I felt hurt and sore to think that the others had shown so little respect for him, and grateful to you and Madale." " Sigrid," he said, quietly, "why will you not let me be something more to you than a friend? All that I have is yours. You are not happy in Herr Gronvold's house. Let me take care of you. Come and make my house happy, and bring Swanhild with you to be my little sister." "Oh, Torvald!" she cried, "I wish you had not asked me that. You are so good and kind, but—but " "Do not answer me just yet, then take time to think it over," he pleaded; "indeed I would do my best to make you very happy." " I know you would," she replied, her eyes filling with tears. "But yet it could never be. I could never love you as a wife should love her husband, and I am much too fond of you, Torvald, to let you be married just for your comfortable house." "Your aunt led me to expect that, perhaps, in time, after your first grief had passed " " Then it was very wrong of her," said Sigrid, hotly. "You have always been my friend—a sort of second brother to me—and oh, do let it be so still. Don't leave off being my friend because of this, for indeed I cannot hdp it." " My only wish is to help you," he said, sadly; " it shall be as you would have it" And then they walked on together in an uncomfortrble silence until they overtook the others at Herr Gronvold's gate, where Torvald grasped her hand for a moment, then, looking at his watch, hurried Madale away, saying that he should be late for some appointment Fru Gronvold had -unluckily been looking out of the window, and had seen the little group outside.' She opened the front door as the two girls climbed the steps. "Why did not the Lundgrens come in?" she asked, a look of annoyance passing over her thin, worn face. " I didn't ask them," said Sigrid, blushing. "And I think Torvald had some engagement," said Swanhild, unconsciously coming to the rescue. " You have been out a long time, Swanhild, "now run away to your practising," said Fru Gronvold, in the tone which the child detested. " Come in here, Sign a, I want a word with you." Fru Griinvold had the best of hearts, but her manner was unfortunate; from sheer anxiety to do well by people she , often repulsed them. To Sigrid, accustomed from her earliest girlhood to come and go as she pleased and to manage her father's house, this manner was. almost intolerable. She resented interference most strongly, and was far too young and inexperienced to see. beneath her aunt's dictatorial tone, the' real kindness that existed. Her blue eyes looked defiant as she marched into the sitting-room, and drawing off her gloves began to warm her hands by the stove. " Why did you not ask Torvald Lund- gren to come in ? " asked Fru Gronvold, taking up her knitting. "Because I didn't want to ask him, auntie." " But you ought to think what other people want, not always of yourseIC" " I did," said Sigrid, quickly. " I knew he didn't want to come in." " What nonsense you talk, child !" said Fru Gronvold, knitting with more vigour than before, as if she vented her impatience upon the sock she was making. "You must know quite well that Torvald admires you very much; it is mere affectation to pretend not to see what is patent to all the world." " I do not pretend," said Sigrid, angrily, " but you—you have encouraged him to hope, and it is unfair and unkind of you. He told me you had spoken to him." "What! he has proposed to you?" said Fru Gronvold, dropping her work. " Did he speak to you to-day, dear ? " " Yes," said Sigrid, blushing crimson. "And you said you would let him have his answer later on. I see, dear, I see. Of course you could not ask him in." "I said nothing of the sort,' - said Sigrid, vehemently. "I told him that I could never think of marrying him, and we shall still be the good friends we have always been." " My dear child," cried Fru Gronvold, with genuine distress in her tone, " how could you be so foolish, so blind to all your own interests? He is. a. most excellent fellow, good and steady and rich —all that heart could wish." " There, I don't agree with you," said Sigrid, perversely. " I should wish my husband to be very different He is just like Torvald in Ibsen's Ett Dtikkehjem, we always told him so." " Pray don't quote that hateful play to me," said Fru Gronvold. "Every one knows that Ibsen's foolish ideas about women being equal to men and sharing their confidence, could only bring misery and mischief. Torvald Lundgren is a good, upright, honourable man and your refusing him is most foolish." " He is very good, I quite admit," said Sigrid. " He is my friend, and has been always, and will be always. But if he was the only man on earth nothing would induce me to many him. It would only mean wretchedness for us both." "Well, pray'don't put your foolish notions about equality and ideal love into Karen's head," said Fru Gronvold, sharply. " Since you are so . stupid and unpractical it will be well that Karen should accept the first good offer she receives." "We are not likely to discuss the matter," said Sigrid, and rising to her feet die hurriedly left the room. Upstairs she ran, choking with angry tears, her aunt's test words haunting her I persistently, and inflicting deeper wounds the more she dwelt upon them. She wants me to marry him so that she may be rid of the expense of keeping us," thought the poor girL "She doesnt really cate for us "a bit, for all the time She is grudging the money we Cost her. But 1 won't be such a bad friend to poor Torvald as to marry him because 1 am miserable here. I would rather stan'e than do that Oh 1 how I hate her maxims about taking what you can get! Why should love and equality and a true union lead to misery and mischief? It is the injustice of lowering woman into a mere pleasant housekeeper that brings half the pain of the world, it seems to me." But by the timeSigrid had lived through the long evening, bearing as best she the consciousness of her aunt's disappointment and vexation with, her, another thought bad begun to stir in her heart And when that night she went to her room her tears were no longer the tears of anger, but of a miserable loneliness and desolation. She looked at little Swanhild lying fast asleep, and wondered how the refusal would affect her life. "After all," she thought to herself, Swanhild would have been happier had accepted him. She would have had a much nicer home, and Torvald would never have let her feel that she was a burden. He would have been very kind to us both, and I suppose I might have made him happy—as happy as he would ever have expected to be. And I might have been able to help Frithiof, for we should have been rich. Perhaps I am losing this chance of what would be best for everyone dse just for a fancy. Oh what am I to do ? After all he would have been very kind, and here they are not really kind. He would have taken such care of me, and it would surely be very nice to be taken care of again." And then she began to think of her aunt's words, and to wonder whether there might not be some truth in them, so that by the time the next day had dawned she had worried herself into a state of confusion, and had Torvald Lundgren ap- proached her again might really have accepted him from some puzzle-headed notion of the duty of being practical and always considering others before yourself. Fortunately Torvald did not appear, and later in the morning she took her perplexities to dear old Fru Askevold, the pastor's wife, who having worked early and late for her ten children, now toiled for as many grandchildren, and into the bargain was ready to be the friend of any girl who chose to seek her out In spite of her sixty years she had a bright, fresh- coloured face, with a look of youth about it which contrasted curiously with her snowy hair. ' She was little and plump and had a brisk, cheerful way of moving about which somehow recalled to one— •The bird that comes about our doors When autumn winds are sobbing, The Peter of Norway boors Their Thomas in Finland, And Russia far inland. The bird, who by some name or other,. All men who know it call their brother." " Now that is charming of you to come and see me just at the very right minute, Sigrid," said Fru Askevold, kissing the girl, whose face, owing to trouble and sleeplessness, looked more worn than her own. " I've just been cutting out Ingeberg's new frock, and am wanting to sit down and rest a little. "What do you think of the colour? Pretty, isn't it? " "Charming," said Sigrid. "Let me do the tacking for you." " No, no; you look tired, my child, sit down there by the stove, and I will tack it together as we chat What makes those dark patches beneath your eyes ? " " Oh, it is nothing. I could not sleep last night, that is alL" Because you were worrying over something. That does not pay, child; give it up. If s a bad habit" " I don't think I can help it," said Sigrid. " We all of us have a natural tendency that way. Don't you remember; how Frithiof never could sleep before an examination ? " " And you perhaps were worrying your brain about him ? Was that it ? " "Partiv," said Sigrid, looking down and speaking nervously. "You see it was in this way-—I had a chance of becoming rich and well-to-do, of stepping into a position which would have made me able to hdp the others, and because it did not come up to my .own notion of happiness I threw away the chance." And so little by little and mentioning no name, she put before the motheriy old lady all the facts of'the case. Child," said Fru Askevold, "I have only one piece of advice to give you—be true to your own ideal." " But then one's own ideal may be unattainable in this -world." " Perhaps, and if so it can't be helped. But if you mean your marriage to be a happy one, then be true. Half the lining to. take just what they can get. you accepted this man's ofier you might be wronging some girl Tvho is really capable of loving him properly." " Then you .mean that some of us have higher ideals than others ? " "Why,yes, to be sure; it is the same in this as in- everything else, and what you have to do is just to shut your ears to all the well-meaning but false maxims of the world, and listen to the voice in your own heart. Depend upon it you will be able to do far more for Frithiof and Swanhild if you are true to yourself, than you would be able to do as a rich woman and an unhappy wife." Sigrid was silent for some minutes. " Thank you," she said at length. " I see things much more clearly now ; last night I cbuld Only see things through Aunt Gronvold's spectacles, and I think they must be very shortsighted ones." Fru Askevold laughed merrily. " That is quite true," she said. " The marriages brought about by scheming relatives may look promising enough at first, but in the long run they always bring trouble and miser)'. The true mar- > are made in heaven, Sigrid, though are slow to believe that Sigrid went away > comforted, yet nevertheless life was not very pleasant to her just then, for > although she had die satisfaction of seeing Torvald walking the streets of > Bergen without any signs of great dejection in his face, she had all day > long to endure the consciousness of her aunt's vexation, and to feel in > every little economy that this need nothavebeen practised had she decided as > Fru Gronvold wished. It was on the whole a very dreary Christmas, yet the > sadness was brightened by one little act of kindness and courtesy which to > the end of her life she never forgot For alter all it is that which is rare that makes a deep impression on us. The word of praise spoken at the beginning of our career lingers for ever in our hearts with something of the glow of encouragement and hopefulness which it first kindled there; while the applause of later years glides off us like water off a duck's back. The little bit of kindness shown in days of trouble is remembered when greater kindness during days of prosperity has been forgotten. It was Christmas-eve. Sigrid sat in her cold bedroom, wrapped round in an eider-down quilt She was reading over again the letter she had last received from Frithiof, just one of those short, unsatisfying letters which of late he had sent her. From Germany he had written amusingly enough, but these London letters often left her more unhappy than they found her, not so much from anything they said as from what they left unsaid. Since last Christmas all had been taken away from her, and now it seemed to her that even Frithiofs love was growing cold, and her tears fell fast on the thinUttle sheet of paper where she had tried so hard to read love and hope between the lines, and had tried in vain. A knock at the door made her dry her eyes hastily, and she was relieved to find that it was not her cousin Karen who entered, but Swanhild, with a sunny face and blue eyes dancing with excitement "Look, Sigrid," she cried, "here is a pared which looks exactly like a present Do make haste and open it" They cut the string and folded back the paper, Sigrid giving a little cry of surprise as she saw before her the watercolour sketch of Bergen, which had been her father's last present to her on the day before his death. Unable to pay for it, she bad asked the proprietor of the shop to take it back again, and had been relieved by his ready consent Glancing quickly at the accompanying note she saw that it bore his signature. It ran as follows:— " MADAM,—Will you do me the honour of accepting the water-colour sketch of Bergen chosen by the late Herr Falck in October. At your wish I took back the picture then and regarded .the purchase as though it had never been made. I now ask you to receive it as a Christmas gift and a slight token of my respect for the memory of your father," Sic., Sic. " Oh!" cried Sigrid," isn't that good of him ! And how nice of him to wait for Christmas insteadof sending it straight back. Now I shall have something to send to Frithiof It mil get to him in time for the new year." Swanhild clapped her hands. " What a splendid ideaI had not thought of that- And we shall have it up here just for Christmas-day. How pretty it is! People are very kind, I think- !" And Sigrid felt the little clinging arm round her waist, and as they looked at the picture together she smoothed back the child's golden hair tenderly. "Yes," she said, smiling, "after all. people are very kind." CHAPTER XV. As Presten Askevold had feared, Frithiof bore the troubles much less easily. He was without Sigrid's sweetness of nature, without her patience, and the little touch of philosophic matter-of-factness which hdped her to endure. He was far more sensitive too, and was terribly handicapped by the bitterness which was the almost inevitable result of his .treatment by Blanche Morgan, a bitterness which stiriedhim up into a sort of contemptuous hatred of both God and man. Sigrid, with her quiet commonsense, her rarely- expressed but very real faith, struggled on through the winter and the spring, and in the process managed to grow and develop; but Frithiof, in his desolate London lodgings, with his sore heart and rebellious intellect, grew daily more hard and morose. Had it not been for the Bonifaces he must have gone altogether to the bad, but the days which he spent every now and then in that quiet, simple household, where kindness reigned supreme, saved him from utter ruin. For always through the darkest part of every life there runs, though we may sometimes fail to see it, this " golden thread of love," so that even the worst man on earth is not wholly cut off from God, since He will, by some means or other, eternally try to draw him out of death into life. We are astounded now and then to read that some cold-blooded murderer, some man guilty of a hideous crime, will ask in his last moments to see a child who loved him devotedly, and whom he also loved. We are astonished just because we'ido not understand the untiring heart of the All-Father who in His goodness often gives to the vilest sinner the love of a pure-hearted woman or child. So true is the beautiful old Latin saying, long in the world but little believed, " Mergere nos patitur, sed non submergere, Christus " (Christ lets us sink maybe, but not drown). Just at this time there was only one thing in which Frithiof found any satisfaction, and that was in the little store of money which by slow degrees he was able to place in the savings bank. In what way it could ever grow into a sum large enough to pay his father's creditors he did not trouble himself to think, but week by week it did increase, and with this one aim in life he struggled on, working early and late, and living on an amount of food which would have horrified an Englishman. Luckily he had discovered a place in Oxford Street where he could get a good dinner every day for sixpence, but this was practically his only meal, and after some months the scanty fare began to tell upon him, so that even the Miss Tumours noticed that something was wrong. " That young man looks to me underfed," said Miss Caroline one day. "I met him on the stairs just now, and he seems to me to have grown paler and thinner. What does he have for breakfast, Charlotte ? Does he eat as well as the other lodger ? " " Dear me, no," said Miss Charlotte. "It's my belief that he eats nothing all but ship's biscuits. There's a tin them up in his room, and a tin of cocoa, which he makes for himself. All I ever take him is a jug of boiling water night and morning!" " Poor fellow !" said Miss Caroline, sighing a little as she plaited some lace which must have been washed a hundred times into her dress. A delicate carefulness in these little details of dress distinguished the three ladies—they had inherited it with the spdling of their name and other tokens of good breeding. " I feel sony for him," she added. " He always bows very politdywhen I meet him, and he is remarkably good-looking, though with a disagreeable expression." " When one is hungry one seldom looks agreeable," said Miss Charlotte. " I wish I had noticed him before," and she remembered, with a little pang of remorse, that she had more than once preached to him about his soul, while all the time she had been too dreamy and unobservant to see what was really wrong with him. " Suppose," she said timidly," suppose I were to take him a little of the stewed American beef we shall have for supper." "Send it up by the girl," said Miss Tumour, "she is still in the kitchen. Don't tie it yourself—it would be awkward for both of you." So Miss Charlotte meekly obeyed, and sent up by the shabby servant girl a most savoury little supper. Unluckily the girl was a pert cockney, and her loud abrupt knock at the door in itself irritated Frithiof " Come in," he said in a surly tone. "Look here," said the girl, "here's something to put you in a better temper. Missus's compliments, and she begs youH accept it," and she thrust the tray at him with a derisive grin. " Have the goodness to take that down again," said Frithiof, in a fit of unreasoning anger. " I'll not be treated like your mistress's pet dog." Something in his manner cowed the girl. She beat a hasty retreat, and was planning how she could manage to eat the despised supper herself, when at the foot of the stairs she met Miss Charlotte, and her project was nipped in the bud. " It ain't no use, miss, 'e won't touch it," she explained; " 'e was as angry as could be, and says 'e,' Take it away 1 HI not be treated like your mistresses pet dog,' says 'e. So, bein' frightened, I ran downstairs agen." —-Miss Charlotte looked troubled, and later on, when as usual she took up the jug of hot water, she felt nervous and uncomfortable, and her knock was more timid than ever. However, she had scarcely set down the jug on the floor when there came sounds of hasty footsteps in the room, and Frithiof flung open the door. " I beg your pardon," he said. " You meant to be kind, I'm sure, but the girl was rude, and I lost my temper. I ask your forgiveness." There were both pathetic and comic dements in the little scene; the meek Miss Charlotte stood trembling as if she had seen a ghost, and gazing up at the tall Norseman who, in the hurry of the moment, had forgotten to remove the wet towel which, in common with most nightworkers, he was in the habit of tying round his forehead. Miss Charlotte stooped to pick up the jug. " I am so sorry the girl was rude," she said. " I wish 1 had brought it myself. You see, it was in this • way : we all thought you looked so poorly, and we were having the beef for supper, and we thought perhaps you might fancy some, and—and- " "It was very good of .you," he said, touched, in spite of himself, by the kindness. " I regret what I said, but you must make allowance for a bad-tempered man with a splitting headache." "Is that the-reason you tie it up?" asked Miss Charlotte. He laughed and pulled off the towel, jassing his hand over the mass of thick, ight hair which it had disordered. "It keeps it cooler," he said, "and can get through more work." She glanced at the table, and saw that it was covered with papers and books. " Are you wise to do so much work after being busy all day ? " she said. " It seems to me that you are not looking well." " It is nothing but headache," he said. "And the work is the only pleasure I have in the world." " I was afraid from your looks that you had a hard life," she said, hesitatingly. " It is not hard outwardly. As far as work goes it is easy enough, but there is a deadly monotony about it" " Ah ! if only " she began He interrupted her. " I know quite well what you are going to say—you are going to recommend me to attend one of those relig- ;s meetings, where people get so full of delightful excitement Believe me, they would not have the slightest effect on me. And yet, if you wish it, I will go. It shall be my sign of penitence for my rudeness just now." Miss Charlotte could not make ont whether his smile was sarcastic or genuine. However, she took him at his word, and the next evening carried him off to a big, brightly-lighted ball to a revivalist meeting, from which she hoped great things. It was a hot June evening. He came there tired with the long day's work, and his head felt dull and heavy. Merely out of politeness to his companion he tried to take some sort of interest in what went on, stifled his inclination to laugh now and then, and watched the proceedings attentively, though wearily enough. In front of him rose a huge platform with tiers of seats one above the other. The men and women seated there had bright-looking faces. Some looked sdf-consdous and self-satisfied, several of the women seemed overwrought and hysterical, but others had a genuine look of content which impressed him. Down below was a curiously heterogenous collection of instruments— comets, drums, tambourines, trumpets, and pipes. A hymn was given out, followed by a. chorus; the words were solemn, but the tune was the reverse; still it seemed to please the audience, who sang three choruses to each verse, the first loud, the second louder, the third a perfect frenzy of sound, the drums thundering, the tambourines dashing about wildly, the pipes and comets at their shrillest, and everyone present singing or shouting with all his might It took him some time to recover from the appalling noise, and meantime a woman was praying. He did not much attend to what she said, but the audience seemed to agree with her, for every minute or two there was a chorus of fervent" Amens," which rolled through the hall like distant thunder. After that the young man who conducted the meeting read astory out of the Bible, and spoke well and with a sort of simple directness. There was very little in what he said, but he meant every word of it It might have been summed up in three sentences : " There is only one way of beinp happy. I have tried it and have founi it answer. All you who haven't tried it begin at once." But the words which meant much to him conveyed nothing to Frithiof. He listened, and wondered how a man of his own age could possibly get up and say such things. What was it he had found ? How had he found it? If the speaker had shown the least sign of vanity his words would have been utterly powerless ; but his quiet positiveness impressed people, and it was apparent to everyone that he believed in a strength which was not his own. There'followed much that seemed to Frithiof monotonous and undesirable; about thirty people on the platform, one after another, got up and spoke a few words, which invariably began with " I thank the Lord I was saved on such and such a night" He wondered and wondered what the phrase meant to them, and revolved in his mind all the theological dogmas he had ever heard of. Suddenly he was startled to find that someone was addressing him, a hymn was being sung, and there was a good deal of movement in the hall; people went and came, and an dderly woman had stepped forward and taken a place beside him. "Brother," she said to him, "are you saved ? " " Madam," he replied coldly, " I have not the slightest idea." " Oh, then," she said with a little gesture that reminded him of Miss Charlotte, "let me beg you to come at once to Christ" " Madam," he said, still in his coldly polite voice, "you must really excuse me, but I do not know what you mean." She was so much surprised and puzzled by both words and manner that she hesitated what to reply; and Frithiof, who hated being questioned, took his hat from the bench, and bowing formally to her, left the ball.
