We this week publish the fol lowing :— Some men may love a lady for her gold, And therefore cutely strive her hand to gain. But ah ! Euch love we know will soon go cold When wealth to give them joy will be but vain. Let those who will have flirts with gems and wealth. Give me the one that's true and has good health. G.ED. Come let us part with gladness this new year. And give ourselves and prospects one more clicer. And while our glee runs high on matters weighty, Keep on the go till all is gone of " Eighty." How much of good has fallen to our lot Our gain last year must never be forgot. And now the ground has borne its rich fruition, We want no ghost to fright us from our mission. Namely, to live and make our land a gem. Not grudging others, though the gold's with them, M itli giant hearts we'll face the worst and shun it. It shall be said we've played our game and won it, Kaknac. To till the ground the farmer toils, His bread and cheese to gain, But Goyder's ghost glides o'er his "line," With glee to check the rain. Poor "Cocky's" efforts are no good. His gladness turns to grief, To Downer he must go, and pray That he will give relief. If some grim giant of old times Would baffle Goyder's game. Be'd well deserve the costliest gem, Australian anhl emild frame. Gombowie Bot.
