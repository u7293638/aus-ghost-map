SPORTING. BY' CE1nTAR.' -The Amateur- Turf Cb were very;iinit lucky as regards' the breather last Satuuir day. Rain commenced to fall before the first race, and continued all the afternoon. In spite of this there was a large at tendance, and the receipts were in excess of any previous year. Tomorrow the Caulfiield Cup will be run for, when I trust fine weather will greet those who attend to see it run for. The first race on programme is the Selling one of 5 furlongs, for which I fancy Mistake, Primus, and Ilannibal. The Hurdle race ought to re sult Agitation, Cockboat, and Duration. Tihe Nursery Handicap has a large entry, and as usual in these spurts for youngsters is hard to pick. Mly selections are bMun wyrtina, The Nun, and Damocles. The big event comes next when I expect to see about 33 starters at tihe post. This race is very open, most of the competitors having a fair show of winnirngand agoodly number having been backed for large stakes. In selecting a winner for this Caulfield Cup I am influenced by the fact of it being good judgment to go for three years-old according to all records of the Turf in Victoria, and therefore my selec tion shall be Winchester fiirst witlh Velo cipede, Claptrap, Mozart, Iad Despot next best. The steeplechase has 18 entrees. I fancy M?ernder, Lady Ashton, and one of Read's to furnish the winner. The last race of the meeting is the Windsor Handicap for which I select Too Too, Mentmore, or The Ghost. Betting on the Derby is quiet just now, Nordenfeldt being still first favorite at 4 to 1, First Chester, Thunderbolt, and isonomy coming next. For the Melbourne Cup, Trenton,Nor-, denfeldt, and Liverpool, three New Zealand bred horses are at 14 to 1, any thing else 20 to one.
