A Modern Ghost Story. Science has offered another indignity to the ghosts, by a prosaic yet curious. explanation of a supernatural vision. . The :haunted house was the "Meade" mansion, in Washington. The servants all declared it to be haunted, that they had often, and many of thdm, seen the stern face of the old commodore and his old niother-both long since dead looking out of the rear window. Oth ers had also seen it at times. Finally, a tenant took the house and learned of its evil reputation. With a scientific friend, he investigated the phenomenon. They, too, saw the stern faces: It was found, at last, that a very old French plate glass, made of a peculiar sand, was used in the window. Probably at some time the commodore was standing and his mother sitting near the window in a thunderstorm, and by a flash of lightning unusually sharp their faces were photographed into the glass. The glass was . cut out, and the features could still be seen when carried into a favorable light.
