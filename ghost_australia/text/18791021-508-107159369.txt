Fisher's Ghost Reproduced. Professor Pepper introduced another remarkable novelty last evening at the School of Arts. He gave a brief account of the circumstances attending the well-known story of Fisher's ghost, and afterwards, when the curtain rose, there appeared before the spectators a fence with some shrubbery. Slowly a figure appeared, seated upon the top rail, with a ghastly wound upon his brow. Weir, the person who (according to the story) was the first person to see the ghost, then appeared on the scene, and addressed the figure, which, on being approached, faded away, then re-appeared, and a light was dis- tinctly visible shining through the body. The illusion was most cleverly managed, and evoked con- tinued applause. The remainder of the programme, which was of a lighter nature, tent the large audience home in a contented frame of mind.
