REV. THOMAS COOK'S MISSION. WAVERLEY.^' On Sunday last the above mission was com menced under very favourable circum stances and with most encouraging results. The congregations at all the services, were unusually large. The mission preacher entered upon his work evidently endowed with the influences and indwelling power of the Holy Ghost. At the close of the morn ing service, which was one of blessing and spiritual quickening, Mr. Cook held a short meeting for Christian workers. Directions and encouragements were given, both how to influence others to attend the services, and in leading awakened souls to Christ. In the afternoon — at the service for young people — over 90 manifested their decision to serve God by entering the enquiry ^room. In the evening, after a service oi great power, several others gave themselves to God. Monday night the congregation was large, Mr. Cook preached a sermon on, ' The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, elean sethusfrom all sin.' It was a time of blessing to many. Six persons entered the enquiry room. On Tuesday the power in the services was greater than at any other day. At 3 in the afternoon a Holines, meeting was held. Many souls were moved, while Mr. Cook in an address, which lasted about an hour, spoke on ' Beckoning our selves to be dead nnto sin.' In the evening the congregation was large, numbering fully 500\. The sermon, which dealt with ' Ex cuses,' was addressed more especially to young men. It was calculated to lead many to immediate decision. Twenty-four persons, among whom was a number of young men, entered the enquiry rooms There was great joy as the day closed. These are only 'notes by the way.' A more complete account of the mission and its results will be furnished, all being well, in our next issue.
