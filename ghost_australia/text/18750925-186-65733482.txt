The above ineaningless and '«**«-? odd jumble of words is a literal copy of a. cypher telegram, sent from a firm of ^Mlon maciiaiits in Liverpool to tbeir agents and brokers in New (Means. There is an old saying that one half the wodd does not know how (he other half gets on. It is specially true with TaiyaAmp^ of which the rest of England generally is in a state of the most won derful ignorance* *x^1-fTi. a'^ all con* -^»Ilrv^ being sinTTtfc the greatest and « most inscrutable of tnystcxics to those not immediately concerned. Perhaps a glimpse behind die scenes into one of the mrinritips of the cotton Hade may not be without =Hiun- iwwi to ihe mnni iiated. It must be understood that cypher *i»lffyrraw-5 fl|y fpfeiHy jfigrinrf frntn cypher, or secret, writing ; the one being em as to condensea message into as small a space and as few words as possible. The item for frifcrams (or, as they .axe technically called cablegrams) m a. merchants office is sometimes very SeriOUS, iJtrim-»R amniiiirii^r tO One ' hundred 'pounds a. week. The price per word being a. consideration, the aim is to send as few words, and convey as much information, as possible. A great number of cypher codes are in use, composed generally of columns of words or figures (single letters are notallowed *iiy *™* telegraph conpany) answering to every possible emetgencj. These codes are kept profoundly secret; and to prevent the clerk and employes in the offices . interpreting and divulging the message, a. secret understanding often exists between the principals to read the cypher backwards or forwards half a dozen ?words. The one from which die message above is taken, is contained in a good-sized book, and presents the most unintelligible aspect to an outsider. Indeed, such a queer combination of words as 'scared, pot, screamer, Bobby, and shrimp' might lead one to the con clusion that the cotton merchants were given to pi^iiVy m an ^f****'*™- gppnpc of wit, peculiar to themselves ; but the words have a stem significance that means 'business,' and woe to die on wary mortal who should venture to sug gest that the ghost of a joke lurked in their unsuspecting syllables. They form a cypher telegram of the most unrelenting ** business aspect,' even the diminutive ?'shrimp' bearing a grim message of -special intelligence; and the very un sentimental Christian names, answering to the 'ami»c of 's''^'^ firms, who are wont to be addressed by much more respectful titles. It is necessary to take notice that die cotton bought by cable is still in America or on the sea; in feet, it is often bought, resold, and re-bought again perhaps half a. dozen times before it ever touches the shores of England. The translation of the telegram given .above is as follows:— (We have sold to Eiagaton ?ad Co.. Preston, £00 bales (of cotton) if 7*L (per Kfldare Ib.), good qaality, eotonr. Description apd atyfle.

Their journey is not only very long, but very circuitous. A message from Liverpool to New Orleans goes first to London, from thence back to Holy head and across die Irish Sea to Dnblin; from Dublin to Valentia, the tittle rocky promontory washed iiy the everlasting billows of the Atlantic. Here die Atlantic cable really begins, and the message flies two diousand rones mwlf*r die ocean to Cape Race, a wild head land in Newfoundland1. Its submarine career is not even yet ended, for from Cape Race to Cape Breton there are fifty miles of sea to be traversed. From Cape Breton the telegram is forwarded to New York, and from thence across some thousand mites of American prairie and forest land, tin at last it reaches its destination, New Orleans. The total of its joumeyings to and fro is about five thousand miles. The time which is taken by one of these travelled telegrams varies very much according to die state of business on die main fines, the Atlantic telegram having to wait its turn widi odier telegrams .going shorter distances. Could the whole line be cleared from Iiverpool to New Orleans, die time occupied would be merely the Decessaiy delay j£t r^rt^in places to read die message and re-telegraph it onwards. Almost the shortest message on record is one that was despatched about ai o'clock in die evenmgirom Iiverpool to New Orleans, to which an answer was returned before ten o'clock the same night, which consideringdie round-about route and frequent stoppages, was wonderfully qmefc. The favourite time of day for tele graphing is about two o'clock, and for a very significcnt and curious reason. The time in New Orleans is sis hours behind ours in England, so that a telegram sent from from here about one or two pjn. reaches New Orleans about nine or ten in the morning of the same day. Thus die merchants in Liverpool and Man chester have time to collect their orders in the forenoon and cable them out to (heir agents in time for die 'beginning of morning business in New Orleans. In ''''''THf to this natural phenome non, die Americans say that ' As usual they get the better of John Bull, for they know die morning before what the Britishers do in die afternoon next day.'
