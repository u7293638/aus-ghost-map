SKETCHES IN RUSSIA. BY A JACKLING VICTORIA-. RAILWAY TRAVELLING IN RUSSIA. "Time was made for fools " These words might very appropriately be placarded prominently at every railway station in Russia. " Wait until train stops " "Do not attempt to leave carriage while in motion" such warnings as these are superfluous in a Russian railway carriage The traveller who commits these rush acts generally does so because he is in a hurry. But a travelling Russian and hurry are two incompatible conceptions. It is absurd to expect to find the two things connected The Flying Dutchman stopping at a wayside station to give the passengers time for a stroll on the platform and a smoke, an Italian express starting without the blowing of innumerable danger Lorna , or a Cobb's coach not finding some excuse for drawing up at the hotel as it passes through a country township-all these are easily realisable idea compared to that of a Russian grumbling because a train does not go fast enough Travelling is performed with an ample expenditure of leisure in Russia. To begin at the very beginning sence as you may, whether you leave a friend's house or an hotel for the railway station, you will always arrive there half an hour too Ron everyone does so You have only to mention the music wards, "K'stantsia" (to the railway)), to your sweet child, and he then considers it de rigueur to at once spur his horse into a gallop, and no remonstrances or assurances that you have plenty of time will check his headlong pace Arrived at the station, a porter or moujik meets you, you give him money, and be takes your ticket and registers bag gage for you and brings you the change. It is only strangers to Russia who go through this ordeal themselves , if they do, they will find that, after a struggle at the ticket wickets among a mob of greasy peasants (whose grease comes off their clothes are fit only for a process of boiling down at a tal low factory One reason why you need to be over the mark in time for trams in Russia is that owing to the immense extent of the empire different railway s) stems run at different times. Thus, there are 30 trains which ran as s run according to Petersburg time, seven keep Moscow time, and others run according to the widely differing time of clock in Warsaw, Tiflis, and rkatennenburg But there is a romantic elasticity about the fares as well as the times of Russian railways. The cost of your ticket depends on the fluctuating daily value of the rouble. Suppose you are going from St. Petersburg to Berlin by the afternoon express You ask what your fare will be before you start from the hotel "Well, we cannot tell you what it is to day, but here is what it was yesterday, is the answer you act on this, but by the time you arrive at the station a telegram has arrived from Berlin, stating that owing to an unexpected shipment of silver from some where to somewhere, or from any other equally abstruse financial cause, the value of the trouble has been still further depreciated. As it goes down up at once goes your fare in a way to upset all the careful calculations you have made to avoid taking Russian money out of the country. Till travellers know that they must leave this margin to meet the eccentric instability of the trouble they are sometimes put to greatinconvemence. From tina cause once in a long journey in the centre of Russia we had to go through a process of careful living, if not of moderate starvation, for 38 hours. On some foreign bourse money had become "tighter," had felt "Steadier," easier," or "looser," had been "looking up," or behaving in some other irregular way The result of its free Bponaible action was that our ticket had become several roubles dearer. The railway authorities at the same time refused to look on a London and Westminster Bank note for Â£10 as any thing other than a mere certificate of identity), too formal for a visiting card, not formal enough for a passport monetary value they would not allow to it. But even when you are comfortably settled in the comfortable carriage you may have other obstacles to overcome on the way, as we found journeying from Moscow to St Petersburg. This is the " show " route in Russia, here you actually Jun (or should) 400 miles in 15 hours. We left Moscow one dark evening in a snowstorm driven by a biting wind which took away the breath as you drove against it Our train for St Petersburg leaves at 8 o'clock. We start off with five long carriages and the luggage van We roll out easily enough for an hour or so, then sudden)) stop Passengers get up to look what station it is, inwardly hoping it is one with a bullet where they may get a drink of mixed warm tea and brandy to settle them for the night But there is no station near, only the boundless deserted plain and the dreary snow falling fast, and the wind whistling between the carriages We see the disagreeable truth showed up However, this is the mail train, audio Borne on the guards manage to walk along the line half a mile to the nearest telegraph station, and send to Moscow for a relief engine to pull us out, which could be easily done From Moscow comes back this extraordinary answer -"It is now past 10 o'clock, and too late to fit out another engine , wait where you are till to-morrow morning, when you will he taken out ' We are only 20 miles from Moscow now Imagine a message like this being sent to the Scotch express (of which this line is the Russian cquivulent)stuck up a few miles from London head quarters. This message soon kete known among the passengers, and is received with indignation by the foreigners English and German among them-but with amused resignation by the Russians. " What a very weak engine they must have given us it is all the any. One Russian sticks up for his country, and assures us (in his own words) that "L\ er) thing goes beautifully on Russian railways till something goes wrong" It is only to show the easy going way in which things are managed that I mention this inci- dent at all We want where we are for the night. At daybreak the snow, which has been working quietly on while we enjoy a good sleep, is over the carriage wheels, up to the level of the doors At 10 o'clock an army of men and an engine come to Bunbury us, and pulling on sony we soon find that we, the St Petersburg express, httvegone.SOversts (about 20 miles) in 11 hours. At last we come to the first station, to find to our horror that after an 18 hours' fist there is no buffet at it A moujik, however, has improvised a rough Samovar in the snow, and has brought a large tin of casks. Passengers enter them eagerly and angrily, as it to whet their appetites, and drink the ten, wishing it was something stronger Let another engine joins us here (three engines to live carriages) and our troubles are over, except that when we ought to be arriving in St Petersburg whereon) 10 miles from Moscow, and ultimately he arrive at the capital some time in the middle of the night, li hours late in the 13 hours journey), solely through want of promptitude and good management The snow storm has not been severe enough to prevent a reasonably powerful engine from pulling through a much larger tram The line from St Petersburg to Moscow is called the Nicholas line, it was built by that Emperor, whose private property it long was. The story of its construction has been so often printed that I tremble to retell it Still, those readers who know it already may compliment themselves on being so well informed, and those who have not heard it before should learn it now When the line from Petersburg to Moscow was first surveyed there was long and fierce dispute as to the exact route it should take The towns of Novgorod, Toijok, t!)hink, and others thought that, wherever the line went before or after, it should ultimately pass through them. Besides the, various engineers had as many) different theories about the easiest practicable routes. The Emperor, tired of being appealed to by one side and the other, determined to put an end to the debates. He called for a map of Russia and a ruler, laying-out Moscow and St Petersburg, he placed the ruler on the map and drew a straight line between his two chief towns. Returning the map to the astonished engineers, His Imperial Majesty said, "That is the route the line is to take, and let me hear no more about it till you report it is finished." One result of this autocratic " argument was to make the line very costly. Swamps and rivers have been crossed where they were broadest, cuttings have been made where there was level ground a few hundred yards to either side The only large town lucky enough to find itself on the line is over All along yon travel through a desert, most of the stations stand by themselves out in the fields, and in the distance you may see the buildings or smoke of the towns belonging to them. Between the town and the station 13 generally a road, which in winter is a stream of mud, apel feet slough of despond. The country on the Nicholas line, ugly and swampy near St Petersburg, 13 pretty enough towards Moscow You pass through several deep cuttings. In European Russia, where in all the thousand miles of r ii there is only (I believe) about one tunnel, tins in itself is a novelty, Much of the country is forest, and the first and beeches look beautiful in the pale sunlight in their still white easing of hoar frost Now and then on pass a v allege It consists of a mass of wooden houses one or two buildings in stucco with walls painted yellow orange and brown, and the church with its men table dark green domes. From the gable of every one of these village houses rises the dovecot, perched on top of a mast 15ft or 20ft high As the emblem of the Holy Ghost the day c is directed by the Russian Church to be considered as a sacred bird , but I am sorry to say that for all that Ivan Iv Marovitch is not entirely innocent of partaking of pigeon on other (pie) for his Sunday dinner Near the v things you may sometimes see the signal house of the chief proprietor of the place Some of the newer of these houses are very pretty They are mostly built of wood, and their gables and roofs and verandahs, are covered with a cornice of fretted woodwork most tastefully) executed I may) here remark (digressions may be pardoned seeing readers are accompanying me in the monotony of a Russian railway journey)) that whether it is from living in a land of forests or not, the ordinary Russian peasant is a horn carpenter-more than that, a born artist in wood Even in ordinary chopping of wood, I have been astonished to notice the deft way the) deal with unwieldy shapeless blocks of timber with their small axes. They are as naturally good at this wood work as they are bad at farm labour Russian agricultural labourers would be the despair of a fancy farmer '1 all quite lately the farmers in the wonderfully rich " chorusses," or black soil in the south of Russia, used to scrape the ground with a I wooden plough hundreds of years old in design Nowadays steam implements, almost forced on the people by the pertinacity of German commercial travellers, have put an end to more picturesque and patriarchal methods of tilling the soil Soon after leaving Ever we come to a great bridge, and all the Russians in the carriage rush to the windows and shout out, "Volga, Volga." Russians always a get very excited about the Volga, just in the same way as and indeed even more so than the Germans do about the Rhine. It is here at Iver, the Buen in becomes navigable, and you can take Ship hence and laid down the giant waterway right away to Astrakhan on the shores of the Caspian, a distance of over 2,000 miles, Even here close to its source in the neighbouring Valda falls, the river is, I should think, about 200 yards broad, and is a stately magnificent stream Though it is true that there is very little of interest to be seen on Russian railway routes, the Russian railways make-up for this as much as possible. Let it be understood once for all, that though they may be slow, Russian railways are by far the most com- fortable and luxurious in Europe. Given plenty of time, it is a pleasure to travel by them -fatigue and work are reduced to a minimum. 'The carries are all well warmed by very simple system of hot-water pipes In many of them you can regulate the amount of heat by turning a small handle like that of a gas meter The carriages are generally very long, as there are very few as are turns on Russian lines. I they have a passage their whole length, and, as a rule, on each side of this, compartments which you can shut off by a sliding door They are very seldom crowded, and two persons can nearly always get a compartment to themselves with a seat for each, which is long enough to he down on almost at full length The second class carriages are really as comfortable as the first. The only difference I could notice was that they were fitted up in grey or brown felt cloth, while the first were covered with the finest velvet, cm "son on the northern lines, rich green on the Polish and southern lines The first class 18 cruelly filled by the enormous number of people who seem to have free passes in Russia, military men, officials, and others. In the warmth of first, second, or third class there is no difference, but this you find through out Russia. The talia of the person must be warmed up to the same temperature as the palace of the monarch, or in a Russian winter death would be the result to either occupant Travellers are always courteously treated by the officials. If the) desire to play) cards, for instinct, a small table will be brought into the carriage for them and covered with the orthodox green cloth The railway stations are everywhere most comfortable and convenient There is plenty of room in them, and they also generally realise Mr Ruskin s ideal of a railway station -a place out of which you can get as quickly as possible The stations on the Nicholas line have been most extravagantly built, and are beautiful buildings, looking more like country palaces than the temples of discomfort ' such places usually are They are as long one-storied buildings built of wood, and the four corners are rounded off They stand as an island between all the lines They have platforms at each side. Down trams pass on one side, and up trains on the other, so that there is no mixture of traffic or confusion Russians are extremely proud of their railway stations and they have good reason to be so We have much to learn from them in these matters The traveller in Russia is well looked after as regards meals Every now and then the train stops for a few minutes then ever) one gets out and drink 3 tea. In the severe eli mate this 13 almost necessary to warm ) 1 u up and it is impossible to imagine anything more fragrant and refreshing is 1 mt h railway companies could supply the ex mi sitel) flavoured and perfectly made Russia the (te 1) at their refreshment which they would do more in the cause of temperance than half a dozen rabid Rechabite orators in a year For meals you make longer stopputes Ata Russian railway) bullet yon sit down with as great leisure to dinner as in your own house. The stoppage is generally) for -a minutes or an hour sometimes for more There is no line at the door decline, out your time to you with fiendish accuracy) as in other places on the Continent and no jarring bell to remind ) you and you have just three minutes more before you have half finished scalding yourself with the hot water soup In order to understand the luxurious ideas Russians have in travelling, let me describe an ordinary restaurant station on one of the great lines You come to a station for dinner, we will say. It stands away out in the fields by itself, sometimes the nearest village is 10 miles away, and till your train comes up it must be one of the most deserted places to be thought of. On the platform a man stands to show you towards the restaurant and you find yourself in a very large room, splendidly lighted and warmed and prettily decorated. There is a gorgeously) dressed servant in uniform to open each door for you, and when you get inside you are happy to find that there is not the suspicion of a draught in the place-a consideration when it is cold enough outside to almost freeze the steam the engine is letting off According to the size of the station there are one or two tables about 40ft long in the middle of the room They are beautifully) set out and laid, the linen and silver would do credit in cleanliness to a private house Along the table at intervals are raised in pyramids bottles of wine of all countries, and many of those innumerable Russian liqueurs of which I have before spoken, Their different coloured glass, labels, and capsules, look quite gay These pyramids of bottles are about a yard in diameter at the base, and I must say that with a Russian company at table the way in which they dis- appear is marvellous. I would not have believed that so many bottles could be emptied in so short a time , but you see the proof of it in the rapid disappearance of the symmetric geometrical form of the pj amid masses Even though it is the middle of winter the tables are covered with large bunches of flowers these are set in little heaps ft or 3ft square and 18in high in a foundation of a beautiful soft green moss These flowers give a very pretty appearance to the room. At these stations you get, a splendidly cooked dinner for one rouble and halts d ) If you are still hungry you can have reached a beautifully flavoured white fleshed sort of grouse for one rouble extra the cheapest tame fronts quality to be found any where on can have Russian beers, the wines of the country from the Caucasus or the Crimea tile champagne of the Don and good foreign wines such as Bordeaux and Burgundy and many brands of a French champagne at very moderate prices. The service is such as you can only get in Russia a good natured waiter to every two or three persons All the waiters wear spotless white cloth gloves and a silvered chain round their necks What a difference between a meal of this sort and eating a dinner against time, say at York or the agony of bolting a chop of the Tertiary period at a West of England station Along one wall of the room in the tea counter, spread out with its array of glass tumblers and a large brass Samovar holding several gallons you turn on the tap and help yourself Tal mg tea with lemon is said to be a Russian custom and very likely it is but I do not remember seeing anyone take it in Russia. Besides this large room there are in many other stations, such as the Great Junction of Tchemenula for instance, many other rooms, cosy) and comfortable smoking rooms reached without going outside along the platform, lavatories where you can get a good wash, dressing rooms and rooms comfortably fitted up with well cushioned bed couches where you can he down and rest for several hours waiting for your "son when you have to change All this comfort is as a matter of course, you are not charged any) thing extra for it, and can enjoy it all whether like" a meal at the buffet or not But in many of the stations which belong to a considerable town there are other objects of interest to look at when you have finished your dinner there assorted shop at one end of the room, on a counter are displayed the wares and choice articles of manufacture of the neighbouring town lou am here have your pockets emptied of roubles, and in return your travelling bag filled with specimens of painted wood, Russia leather dressed in man) was) a and splendidly) embroidered with gold brocaded slippers, made for Russian feet-an area which gives ample scope for a lavish show of most exquisite work, steel ware, and many other tempting mementoes i here is also a counter with Parisian and the famous Russian con fectionery encased in beautiful boxes an other for tobacco with about 50 or 60 du front varieties of cigarettes in gaol) pictured glared boxes, and a large bookstall, in which the newest French novels and the latest number of the Paris Petit Journal have i alway s the most prominent place At many of the stations in addition to this, you find a book has veteran anomalous thing in Russia I We naked one of them at an inconsiderable station what book he sold most copies of On a little pressure he told us it was Loin a Aisommoir, of which he sold on an average one cop) a day to passing travellers So lunch for the prospects of French realism in Russia. But Zola's works are spotless purity compared to many filthy and prudent works I have seen openly hawked at these stations It is impossible to understand son, of all people in the world the Russian authorities allow this disgusting inns ince to continue to the extent it does At all stations on are reminded you are in the country where outward display of religion is not a premium by the chapel or shrine in the corner of the great room All Russian travellers, hungry) us they are, walk reverently up to it before proceeding to attack their nicol at the table This Blume is often itself the size of a moderate room, it is shut off from the rest of the floor by a wooden wall r and it about 4ft Inch In general shrine the chapel shrine is natural e a small church with the pen doors shut and the inside hearts and divisions taken and) the sacred picture bands under domed canopy of wood offers of only be actually carved there is always a lamp and often Several papers burning round it The only discomfort on Russian railways is the necessity of taking precautions against petty thefts. As soon as you know the ways of the country you always leave one of the porters in charge of your things when you leave the carriage even for a few minutes, and he guards them for a few specks Every one does una who has travelled any time in the country. But the thieving is not always what should be called petty. On one occasion, shortly before the journey) I have above spoken of the Moscow train arrival at St Petersburg without the luggage van It had been stolen on the road. The guard in charge had detached it as the train went along he had peasants in tennis with him who helped to unload it, the) then together ran it back empty to the nearest station, shunted it there with a story of accident, and went back to divide the spoil On mother occasion the theft wires worked this way. The guards threw out his luggage as the train passed unfrequented places between distant stations Peasants were placed along the line to pick up the luggage, they kept it to the intentions guards, who visited them soon and give them part of the plunder for a reward I know that these occurrences are quite true At the same time it is only fair that each traveller should speak as he finds things, and after travelling about 2,000 miles on Russian railways we never done nothing either from carriage or luggage van T thefts, too, are generally said to be becoming less common on all the great lines, I should add that in Russia, on the immense length of lines, all trams are run on the principle that a train is not allowed to leave one station before the train preceding it has arrived at the next station With this provision for safety) we find an extreme point) of collision. With their unrivalled comforts and lining and their moderate fares, there is no doubt that in all points except speed the Russian railways are models to be copied by ad other countries in Europe.
