A GHOST STORY. Hitherto free from notoriety of any kind - ob jectionable or otherwise-our district (says the Tumut and Adelong Times) is likely to become famous for supernatural visitations. - Two ghosts have been seen lately, one at a certain spot between this and Adelong, the other at Heedy Flat. Tho first mentioned pays regular nocturnal visits to a party of roadmakers in the direction mentioned, but vanishes whenever threatening meausures are resorted to. A hammer for instance was thrown at him, or-her (for the sex is not quite curtain), the other night, but without killing or disabling the intruder. The pre- sumption is, it must have gone clean through the visitor, for a straight aim was taken, and a miss was impossible. However, no body, dead or injured, or any part thereof, could be dis- covered. That at Reedy Flat assumes the form of a candidate for marriage, and comes to regain the affections of his intended bride, which were nipped before fruition by the death of him , who now takes this unusual form of renewing, his addresses. The lady is frightened out of her wits, and bolts the moment tho candidate, appears. The police have been consulted, in the matter and have given such instructions as may lead to the unravelling of thesec unpleasant mysteries.
