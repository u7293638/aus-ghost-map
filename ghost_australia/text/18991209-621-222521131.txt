STOCKS ANO SHARES. Tuesday. ou.umues ana Jonaon are the keys to the pre sent pok) "ion ot tlie Melbourne market. Para doxical thougrh It be, Victoria Is virtually a e nf®"seable In the Melbourne "market." Diviatng the market Into ten parts, companies nating a London register would make up about one l,art would tall to Investments, wlille all Victoria could claim would be the re maining two parts. Tills Is the present per- «?ec.i 1 1 of Stock Exchange affairs. Of the part plajed by London, It Is not now necessary to speak In detail. Suffice It to say that money Is dearer. .This stringency Is evidenced In the nlgli rates ot discount (6 per cent.) the banks have found it necessary to Impose. War and wool are two important elements In the In- ; creased demand for gold. Not only has London receive gold from the Rand, but has to exl'ort Epecle for the needs or her troops. Within the last month or two tnese changes have occasioned a displacement of something like twelve millions. The rise In the price of wool demands more money to carry 7i- i lne "auons business. A11 tins Is summed up In a discount rate of 0 per Sen ?!? is ?"Ilat ',aB now to be paid in Lon- don for gold. The application to Stock Exchange affairs Is found in the obstacle such a rato offers to speculation, and in the unwillingness on the part of dealers to carry on their transactions to next settling day," or. in market phrase, to pay G per cent, for "contango." To sum up, money is at premium, and monev Is worth more than scrip. Prices are consequently down, and badly down. Tills is what we have been pre dicting for tlie last three weeks. As to the part played by sulphides, tlie Barrier and Wes- tralia must speak. At the Barrier the prospect or a solution of this great question has infused new life into silver stocks. In Westralla the apparent hopelessness of a settlement has aggra- \aicd the fall, which in any case must have been brought about by the stale of the London money market. Associated Mines owe the heavy drop that has taken place In the price of shares to the non-success of a recently erected expensive sulphide plant, while In the case of the Lake View Consols, that leviathan Wcstrallan, private advices from the Held stig matise the process as "an entire failure," Inti mating, at the same time, that the plant has been shut down. How bad this is, is shown bv tlie fall right along the Westrallan line. Even Boulders have-not been able to hold out. In this Etock there lias been an exceedingly large turn- over, but, as far as the Melbourne "Call Room Is concerned. It is practically a one man market. Excitement at the Barrier seems to have subsided. The last wave has left prices vastly higher than they were. At the same time, the market has turned. Tens, which touched six pounds live, are back to six pounds; Junc tions are not bringing more than a pound; Junc tion Norths have receded to Ss lid. In respect to volume of business, the general market is onlv the ghost of what It has been. Great Boulders", with which we have already dealt, and Chllla- goes are two exceptions, but they have had to pay the penalty in prices. Cliillagoes are badly down. Like most of the Limited Liability Com panies, they are feeling the pinch of the London money m&rket.; and. not vpt liMnp rtrAnnnne they feel it all tlie more. Mount Garnets, as a prospect In a more advanced state of develop ment, have not been hit so badly. Another Queenslander to show signals of distress Is the Queensland Mining and Investment Companv, Which have been sold In large blocks down to three shillings. They slumped last week, but this Is another dose of the same mixture. Lon don negotiations are In an Indeterminate state. The company's solicitors consider the contract for purchase binding on the Anglo-European syndicate; but, at the same time, seem to think It inadvisable to engage In costly litigation In defence of rights. The cables are kept busy, but no new move can be made for disposing of the property till tlie present negotiations have been declared either on or off. Tasmanians have suffered, but have suffered less than their intercolonial neighbors. Lyells are back a few shillings, and Blocks are back a shilling or so. North Lyells are, if anything, a littlo firmer, while Souths, on the week's showing, are a. shil ling to the good. Let it be said, none the less, that with the exception of Blocks all these prices are lower than tliey were a month ago. The only other stocks moving In this section are South Tharsis and Royal Tharsls, from both of which gratifying reports are to hand. South Tharsls concentrators are working well. The loss Is reported as nominal, while 'the plant seems capable of profitably treating lower grade ore than was estimated. Royal Tharsls have cut something rich in the lower tunnel. The terms of the Briseis London registration are L 150, 000 cash to present shareholders, and a quarter interest in a new company, with a working capital of L90.000. The small output (16 tons) for November Is the result of tlie re cent landslip. Local Influences make In the direction of diminished business. This Is chiefly because tlie Exchange will be closed at Christmas for nearly a fortnight, a condi tion which renders It much more desirable to be "out" than "In." Two mining centres are especially dull, viz., Ballarat and . Bendigo. Nothing doing In this; only a few Pltfield Plains ventures to the fore In that. Victorian market in a nutshell consists of transactions in Wal- lialla and Maldon stocks. It ,1s many months since Long Tunnel Extcndeds have fluctuated so much within a week. Extreme prices show a difference of nearly three pounds. They are now about a pound under opening price. The fall took place owing to an Impression that yields were not likely to be maintained. An idea Is abroad that the company Is working In a corner of Its ground, and that the shoot of gold gets shorter and shorter as depth Is at tained, the Extendeds getting less of the gold- bearing stone, and the Long Tunnel Company more. We think we have heard this before. The mine manager, having given an official disclaimer to the rumor of diminished yields, strong buying took place, evidently with the Intention of stripping the market, and pinching the Epeclcers. Shares recovered to L25, but have failed to hold at that price. Long Tun nel are to be had for less, but the full 28s must be paid for Norths. New Loch Fynes have varied very little, but Maude and Homeward have spurted to 9s. Maldon prospects arc brightening. South Germans are recovering, arid higher prices are ruling for South German Reef Extended. Tho market for the latter has eased the last day or two; but, as they are within crellrlner distance of the reef, nnv moment mnv see them well over twenty shillings. Fentemans are constantly asked for, and an advance has been made by Beehive and German Consoll- dateds. Banks don't present the same Impene trable phalanx that they did. None the less, higher rates are ruling for Colonial, and the market seems rather bare of London (prefs.) and London Deposit Receipts. Melbourne Trams are very firm, and an exceedingly busy market has prevailed for Silverton Trams and for Broken Hill Water Supply. The revival at the Bar rier has." of course, a reflective effect on the prosperity of these Investments. New South Wales Government is nibbling at the purchase of the Silverton line. A preliminary inquiry lies been made as to the company's willingness to sell. The following are the sales recorded for the week: — Bank Deposit Receipts.— The Special Assets Trust Co., 17s 4d.
