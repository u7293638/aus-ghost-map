THE ANGELS OF FOWLER'S GAP. BY RANDOLPH BEDFORD. So the Angels walked down the Gap, flower crowned, for the day was a summering, and Sturt's Meadows lay with the bloom of the' desert pea rolling over them in crimson-and sweet hand in sweet land, loverwise-for they were as fond of each other as if they were used to quarrelling over their play- things. Rita delighted to decorate Jim, and Jim delighted to decorate Rita; wherefore they came down Fowler's Gap, crimson crowned, golden heads. The Angels' mother stood at the door of the shanty built against the rocky wall of the Gap and shaded her eyes to watch " the splinters of her," as she called them, trotting in that valley of shadow. You go through Sturt's Meadows, making for Bancannia Lake, and you meet grout quartzite slugs, and then cliffs draw together as they go and heighten and darken and narrow more, so that when you are next the end of the pass you speak low, for the rocks hang as if a voice vibration would start them crashing. Then the road becomes smoother and the sides steeper, and you suddenly shoot into a blinding light sun-ray and sand glare-and the dust whirlwind strikes' you. Your feet sink into the sand hock-deep-north and east and west there are hills and south, whence you have come, half-hidden by the projection of the Gap, is a big refreshing sand soak, gum-fringed and cool. The Angels' mother, as befitted her middle age, saw only the dark gun as the Angels went down it-the Angels themselves saw the blinding glare of the plain, which is passion, and the cool gum soak, which is love ; for to them these things are yet to come, and their mother has done with both. Looking at this mother and her rugged mate, who is prospecting in the ranges just now, you wondered if they really were the parents of the Angels. They were ugly and angular, and seamed with the seams of an unsuccessful struggle for a living. The father of the Angels was originally the satellite of a bricklayer. He had fallen from a building - amputation of a leg had followed, and he was turned out of the hospital to buffet a sea of misfortune, and as well able to live through the buffeting as a ship with a shattered forefoot. Hut he lived somehow for a year, and then he met the Angels' mother-an angular servant girl, who admitted to 35, and who married the cripple principally because she was tired of being called an old maid. But she made him a good wife, neverthe- less. She was incapable of a grand passion, but there was a large maternity in her, and she almost loved him when he returned in the evening worn out with the search for work and heartbroken at not having found it. Then she treated him as a baby, showing plainly how much she wanted one. At such times this ugly couple looked almost beauti- ful- she with the heaven-sent expression of maternity on her face, and his ennobled by her reflection. For the rest she attended to his stomach more than to his heart. Good and womanlike, she burned Lempriere and studied Beeton's Cookery Book. At any rate, she would have done so had she been a reading woman, which I regret to say she was not. They had been married seven years when I Rita, the elder of the Angels, was born. Much to the surprise of themselves, their child was very beautiful, and the mother, who had been reading the London Journal, named her after some silly young woman who, according to the pictures, was invariably speaking in tones of anguish to earls and viscounts with corset-made waists. Despite the name and the Implied association, the child thrived. Nature was evidently very pleased with her work, for two years later she made another casting and then destroyed the mould absolutely and for ever. The London Journal fever had spent itself by this time, so the second Angel was named Jim. Now the surname of the Angels was Proudfoot, which is more serviceable than angelic. Proudfoot and his wife they were both over forty by this time tasted the youth they had never known when they were young in watching the young lives expand. Man and woman felt then more than ever the curse and crime of poverty they desired the children to be "a lady and gentleman," Had they had money the man and woman in their ignorance would have caused the children to be crammed with a premature education, making them nothing but date-books and dictionaries. As it was, the babies were ignorant, except in the matter of nursery rhymes and the cunning of sweetness-they were merely angels. Thus Mrs. Proudfoot-" Now, Rita, ye must eat your stop before you get your pie, or else ye'll die, and that's pastry." " Well, I want to die, mum, wife wings." "But you're an angel note, my pet." And then came the cunning. " Once was a time an' I knew a little girl an' se did eat up her son, an' se dredge did but I never heard a little girl die when we did eat pie." Wherefore pie for a dozen. Proudfoot was proud of these things. He said they would dress Rita in boy's clothes and make a lawyer of her. Haply all these intentions were never carried out, and you shall hear why. The wealthy cities of the Australias, comfortable enough for the average labourer, meant for a cripple a running light with starvation. Lazurus feeds on the crumbs dropped from the table of Dives ; Proudfoot fed on the rejections of Lazarus. Rita was four years old and Jim two when stories of Broken Hill, pegged by Charles Rasp in eighty-three, swept into the cities, through them, and out again, carrying in the ebb all sorts and conditions of men. Among them were the cripple, his wife, and the Angels. A few months in Silverton gave them means to go into business for themselves, and they travelled 50 miles or so north-west of the silver centre, and opened a shanty near where Sturt's Meadows break into the rocks of the Gap. There has always been a large traffic that way. Prospectors, drovers, station hands, use the press as the best opening towards civilisation from Yfincanniu, Ban- cannia, the Packsaddle, nutt even the far- away Coomonderry, which,, as everybody knows, are concentric, arid which, the Angels say, are the walls of the children's Heaven. You have to grow up to find that to Heaven there are many walls, one inside the other. Then there were many prospectors camped around the Gap trying to find, not another Broken Hill, for even then it was sneered at, but another. Apollyon, another Hen and Chickens, unother.Pluck-up. And the Gap Shanty was a great show place, too. Firstly, the Angels ; secondly, a stunted horse, which some miscreant at Euriowie had fed on gin and mutton, and which, owing to its manly diet, was almost human, according to Mr. Richard Hayes, ex graduate and remittance man and present prospector, and to ex Constable O'Mahoney, who, having shown supernal idiocy during his thirty years of police service, now considered that he was the only man under heaven who could find a true fissure lode without a lantern. Hayes and O'Mahoney were responsible for the baptism of the babies Proudfoot as angels. They, and indeed all the visitors to the shanty, simply idolised the children as in the bush fashion, they loved everything small. The companionship made of the children little men and women. Thus Rita said she held a horn sing" when a roysterers had given her a shilling and Jim, seeing O'Mahoney scribbling in his line, inquired what it was for, just as he inquired the uses of everything from his mother to the moon. O'Mahoney replied "that there Willyama do be shaken' me hat so I put me enthralls in it to know it again." Of course, O'Mahoney meant initials," but Jim accepted the statement literally, and insisted on the same operation being performed on his cap. One there was whom the children instinctively disliked. This-man was one Brady, of the type of swindler and the tribe of any passing an honest, cas) sovereign to steal a hard sixpence He was not conspicuous as a spendthrift, and yet he never could hold money. It was feast or famine with him, but his experience never taught him anything, which proves to me that all thieves are men of small brain Had he been an intelligent thief he would have seen long before this that extremes are crimes, whether the extremes of energy or inertia, of good or evil that the exaggeration of good, which implies a turn to the bad as all emotions are circular, is often evil, and that the exaggerations of evil are often good In the case of the Angels this extremity of evil in Brady was a saviour Brady, swindler and fool, described him self by his features You could read there the belief in his ability to thieves and cover up his tracks Looking at him you seemed to hear him reef at his favourite boast-" It don't matter what's yeh formation Tell me the kind of mine yeh want, an' I'll make it For yes , give me a outcrop, with a bit of' silica of a trace of manganese in it, an I'm yeh Moses for another Pluck up But despite these boasts he was considered "straight enough " by the shanty keeper of the Gap and its habitues They had heard him say this summer morning that he had a big thing on, and hoped to sell it to a Melbourne tug tomorrow Grandjean, an' Hansen, an' Burrett could find a lode what was there He could find a lode what wasn't an) where, and sell it too This was set down as another of Brady's boasts The Cup was not a rich mining camp, as the despairing prospectors dad) testified However, Brady must have had something to do this day, when the world seemed to have gone a summering Proud foot and Hayes and O'Mahoney left for their prospects immediately after breakfast Brady waited until the sun bent the roof him, then mounted his horse, and rode off north through the Gap When he had reached the plain the Band seemed to su allow him at a gulp he was not in the Gap he was not in the plain-he had vanished A very peculiar person was Mr. Brad) The children played around the shanty until early afternoon, and then started to walk to the great and gracious soak we told you of land which is the only shade barring blows of quartzite and iron for half a dozen miles the sea was the great playground of the Angels, and of poor sulky Dave) Wells, the only other child of the region, the child who recognised his own ugliness and tin Angela' beauty Davey Wells, in the natural sequence of things, should have become an anarchist he was one then, in the presence of the Angels aristocracy of privilege which resulted 1 from their beauty) He was an anarchist then, I say, but his hands were tied But he longed to destroy the cm and everything, all the same in the soak the Angels played together, and the anarchist played alone, enjoying himself sadly in the English manner. But the beauties of the sea would have charmed und softened any child who had not been born a Richard Crookbuck Sand was common, certainly, but under the sand of the sea there was sweet water which one could watch filtering in But the greatest pleasure they had sat night, for the Angels slipped away to the soak after supper, if the shanty were full and the father and mother busy. In the night, almost as hot as the day, when the electric white moon glistened on the land as on an ice held, the Angels would pass through the Gap, and sitting on a stone at the edge of the soak, wait for the phenomenon It is a very common sight, but John in Patmos never saw a liner Around is mean looking saltbush, In shocked and banked by the red sand, and between theaultbushare spaces of a foot or so square The moon shines white on them Presently the dust is thrown aside, mineral salts bubble out of the ground, the bubbles spread, subside, and a cake forms Now look at it The moon is multiplied to infinity-it is re elected hundred wise, the salts lie on the plain in sheets of crystal-it is as if God had paid the world with glass In a few minutes it resembles, and folds together like a snail's ooze, and the earth is dull again 'The Angels never grew weary of these sights To them it was always old and ever new Amusement was provided themsleves -in the daytime, the soak and at night the glass floor. And on this day, let it be repeated, they walked down Fowler's Gap-two love lines in flesh sung to the accompaniment of the metallic wind, sounding in the Gap as a reed organ. The mother watched them till a turning in the Gap hid them from sight, and returned to her duties in the shanty The children left the Gap, but did not enter the plain A great "goanna" is) on a rock, awaiting vagrant lives Now, the Angels were very fond of jew lizards and "goannas" and other harmlessness, and they circled the rock to see his goanna ship clover. When the goanna had gone, a great striped jew lizard started up and ran before them He headed for the cliff, and the children thought they had him But he advanced confidently, and, after winding round boulders and under hanging rocks and through bad) passes, they found themselves in another and a new Gap, which nobody at Fowler's had ever known before But as the Angels followed the pass, which tended. shorewards although at a much greater height than the known Gap, they saw that someone else had discovered the place before them. Emerging from the pass, they found a great costeen pit, many yards square and about 20ft deep I'I his pit was probably the work of some prospectors of the earlier Barrier men, who might have won from it a 20,000 slug of horn silver, and, on the other hand, might not have struck anything but disappointment At any rate, they had abandoned the hole, and the mysterious approach to the pass and hidden it from the eyes of later men Six or seven feet below the surface of the costeen a stage of gum saplings had been driven into the bank. Mulga and kangaroo grass and desert peas grew around and over it, almost hiding a narrow drive put in from the staging The Angels noticed all this, and wondered David Wells, who followed them without their knowledge, saw these things and wondered also, for no man in Fowlers Gap knew of this once worked gorge, scarred by the costeen and the d) nannie cartridge The Angels went on, and Davis followed at a safe distance He was very shy that day, and he did not want to see them The Angela went on and played and went on, and the girl Angel began to sing so that the mr followed and rolled with the shrill music of a Barrier shanty ballad " For near or far there a few Can hit Uko Wankaroo , Ills blessed arms a bench of beaks his fists a steel bound law, And' there ain't a fault or flaw In a judgment on the jan That's delivered at the end of all Uro roads to Waukaroo. ' In this wise Rita, with Jim as a struggling chorus and Davie Wells back in the pass beyond the costeen, humming in sympathy The song startled two things It startled Brady's horse, morose animal, which liked not singing, and grazing furtively on the salt bush , it startled Bimi) himself If you looked around and outside the tunnel Brady had put into the cliff you would have been puzzled Mr. Brady, judging by the mullock he had thrown over the pass into the depths, had taken out about forty feet of drive , but if that were so, why find he again filled up five feet of it why) did he wall up the true face with some bagged stuff and fasten it as a conglomerate with a hammer and why did he break into a cold sweat when he heard the Angels' voices ' Firstly, and lastly, Mr Brad) was engaged in manufacturing a mine He had his lode all right-a great hunger) ironstone-and now he had made a pocket of colonies, so that when a purchaser should stray along that purchaser's mouth would water, and he would cr), " Here's another Broken Hill " Mr. Brady might have succeeded had he been less greed) ; but Mr Brady) was pin) ing for a big stake anything from £10,000 to £20 000 and he expected a city speculator next day And now, after that secret stealing of picked samples, to make the bonanza , after all the weary night cartage of the bagged stuff to the forgotten pass , after the herculean labour 01 tearing down piecemeal a wall of adamant 40ft. long and 6ft high and 3ft wide, after the awful anxiety) of covering up his tracks, the Angels came along with their songs of the shanty to blast all his plans in his own eyes he had covered his operations so well-he had forgotten but one thing, and that one thing all fools overlook You can do nothing, good or evil, and escape the consequences justly so, the inevitable seeing eye is on you Do a bad deed robbery, murder, or the Bell mean beasts which are crimes as great-and ) our deed shall find a voice and tell the secret

Gap the tale of the new pass, the old costeen, Brud) d horse, Brady's queer way of mining putting in dirt instead of taking it out They were perspicuous, were the Angels of Cheshunt), and relentless chatterbox who remembered everything He could hear them saving to Mr Hx rtmittuncemuu Hayes, and ex Constable 0 Mahoney, and the crippled prospector Proudfoot " We did went to the sea as we did find nnuzzer place was a Jew lizard an' Brady a horse was there-he was, an Brady was trow in' dart into a drive, he was And then-questioning and search and detection He was not an intelligent thing was Brady he had plenty of the low cunning which in such men prizes for brains-but outside of his cunning he was dull So dull, in fact, that he could not foresee the consequences of his criminalities-the) were scarcely crimes up to that time He argued that what he was doing with the Baited drive highly respectable church going sharebrokers did with scrip in the cities and he would have gone to gaol puzzled and indignant had a jury convicted him of the suiting Being dull he did not exactly see what he could do He was determined to hold his wild cat claim, sell it next day, and make for civilisation with the money , but he did not see how he could stop the Angt Is mouths So without any such intention he ran out of the drive and interrupted the twentieth report tion of the shanty chorus by seizing the children they were not frightened, although the) disliked him He) knew him and smiled Rita with a clear sympathetic eye Jim with a glance arctic in its purity The) said A yo Brady," and Brady, not answering ttjpk the girl by the collar and the boy by the wrist and, not knowing what he did, dragged them down the pass towards the costeen They went quietly) , they had nothing to fear , only Brady and David Wells, who bid behind a slug as he saw Brady coming, were frightened The mine salter led them to the edge of the costeen immediately above the old bush grown staging, and before be could think, for his muscles were quicker than his brain, the Angels fell with a ory Brady did not look-he ran back like a murderer, because he could think now, and he knew the costeen was bottomed with ironstone splinters sharp as Hints He run to the salted drive, about a quarter of a mile away, finished preparing the claim for the purchaser, mounted his horse, and galloped down the pass at the imminent risk of break- ing his neck, shuddering as he passed the old costs on He must have discovered another track to this hidden gorge, for by the way the children had reached him no horse could squeeze through David Wells lay behind the rock quaking, and did not dare to move, for he thought Brady might return and throw him into the costeen also So the small anarchist lay behind the rock quaking until the sun went down and the thick dusk that comes before moonrise closed over him Then he begun to cry partly for his enemies, the Angela, and partly for himself, and partly for the dark nests And then-blessed sound-the whimper of one enemy broke the sobs of the anarchist, and the girl Angel's voice called "Ayo, Davie " Then the little anarchist blessed the aristocrats for ever and ever When Brady threw the children into the costeen they fell on to the staging, the mulga branches and the clinging peas breaking their fall There he) lay unharmed but for face scratches by the branches for Angel Jim, and a little surface wound on Ritus forehead They did not cry- they were too frightened of Brady for that, and although the staging was rickety, the Angels were perfectly safe, and swayed thee, Heaven borne Dad and mum '11 come fire dreckly, Jim, an' Marney an 'Ayes, an' then we II go come an have breadnjam ' So the) waited patiently for the shanty dwellers, until just before the moon rose the) heard Davie Wella sobbing " A)0 David Davis felt his way to the edge in the dark and said, " Is ya there. Angels * " Yes Can you get us out ' ' Davie would try He had seen Brady UBe a hide bucket in completing the salting and he remembered that the bucket had hOlt or so of green hide rope attached So Davie set out on his quarter mile walk up the pass his heart almost still with fear of the dark ness, out still stout to find that green hide bucket His heart stayed as a stone until suddenly, from his very feet a rock wallaby started and hopped like a grey) ghost down the gorge And then Day he a heart melted, and he burst into tears But he went on crying like a baby and walking like a man He found the bucket and his courage re turned so that he whistled on the way back to the costeen Jim, the light weight angel, he pulled up in the bucket, and then, b) scrambling and pulling and catching streets, and digging her strong little heels into the wall of the costeen, and hanging on to the green hide rope, Rita regained the pigs Then the anarchists, as a revenge on dirty old Brady, threw his dirty old bucket and Ina dirty old rope into the eastern, and the Angels applauded. Next they set off down the pass, for the moon had risen, and the night was as the day. The moon rose, and the children unconsciously blessed it for showing the road home The moon rose, and the shanty dwellers, their hearts leaden with dread, blessed it that it gave them light to find the Angels, for no one thought of Davie. The moon rose, and Brady, watering his horse and filling his water bag at the gum fringed soak, cursed it because it showed him himself Davie took the lead, as being the man of the party, but when they reached the slug which the yellow eyes, turret backed "goanna" had backed on that afternoon, he drew back to let the Angela out first, and so guard their retreat Rita, feeling the loss other protector in the van, sang a line of the song of Wau karoo to keep up her spirits, and stopped again, for she was overstrung by the crime of Brady Now, Brady had finished watering his horse and filling his bag at the soak, and had just mounted when he heard the song line Mr Brady shook a great deal, but rode on And as he entered the Cup he saw the Angels, with blood on their faces, step out of a solid wall into the light, for Davie was yet in the shadow of the rocks, and Brad) knew not of this foot passage to the unknown pass When Brad) saw these, then, he almost fell out of the saddle with fear He recovered himself, dug the spurs cruelly into his horse, and lied like the wind through Fowlers Gap, his horse's hoofs striking the iron road like hammer on anvil-. They at the shanty heard this furious galloping, and Hayes connected it somehow with the disappearance of the Angels The Barrier is almost entirely enclosed in wire fences, as the country was originally sheep stations The shanty is built just inside the Rate of a Starts Meadows paddocks when the gate is closed you catch the horseman, because he dare not ride over a wire at night without strapping a coat to ii. IIIa es shut the gate, and then, like a lightning flash on the moon's rays, the) saw Brady, hatless, ghost faced, gallop up, father an instant at the closed gates, and rush at the top wires The horse hits the wire, hut recovers The scoundrel is a great rider, which covers a multitude of sins It is a great leap-he is over and far out on the Broken Hill road, leaving behind him a shoe cast in striking the wire, which vibrates like a disconnected piano string And after Brad), in hot pursuit, ride the ghosts of the Angels, born of his crime and his superstition The shanty keeper and the prospectors had seen Bride's face as he rode away from horror, and they went towards the sea to see what had frightened him And they found that the Angels had driven the Brad) devil into an insanity of fear by merely being alive and singing a shanty song So the three children were taken to the shunt) kitchen and cried over, and Davie Wells was the man of the house, and Davie Wells's father came there quite sober and kissed Davie, a thing he had been too drunk to do for many months And the love and the innocence and the sweet cunning of the children who were all three Angels now fell on the lonely man and the one woman of Fowler's Gap like gracious liniment on a wound And God was on everybody's lips and in every) body's heart that night, and the moonlight said to them, "Don't sleep but enjoy these Angels who will one day be passion stained and weary men and women like ourselves,' and there was music everywhere, the night the anarchist-anarchist now no longer- brought the range is back from the costeen And the grown folks heard the story of Brady's mine in the hidden pass, and ex remittance man Hayes seemed to deny e much comfort from saying, over and over again, " 1 always disliked Brady Brady's eyes had a common focus " Nobody knew what he meant, but they all agreed with him, because they had an idea that having eyes with a common focus was a disgraceful thing, and the) felt like that I towards Brady O'Mahoney also related that Brady was very like a man he knew who was an Orangeman, which was quite enough for O'Mahoney) I might tell you here that next day the angels guided Proudfoot and lines and Delis and O'Mahoney to BracU's "salt" Well, they took out all the bagged chlorides, which had come from a hundred miles away, and they struck a few feet into the coal face, and came on a glory of gleaming whiteness and emerald, and that glory was a bonanza of 10,000 ounces with silver at 4s the ounce. Hayes said, "You see A man whose eyes have a common focus loses more than he makes " The thief threw away the honest sovereign to grasp the crooked sixpence again The Hidden Pass turned out for Proudfoot and Ha) es and Wells and O'Mahoney) another Appolyon-they took out of it a fortune a man. So that David and Rita and Jim will be a gentleman and a lady and a gentleman one day if their parents have their way, which I pray they may not For ladies and gentleman are as common in the world as sand at Bancannia, but the angels of the world are very very few Will on that moonlit night while the children slept, dreamless as the star, and leaves and O'Mahoney cursed Brad) root and branch, Brad) himself rode south west in a cold sweat, flying the Barrier for ever, and suffering the ineffable agony of crying over spilt milk
