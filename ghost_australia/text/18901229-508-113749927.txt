'TIiatEelDeLDoUy.' CHAPTER L : At a period about ten years before . British transports had landed the first materials for an Australian nation, and English statesmen saw a plan to rid their country of some of its suffering and sinning people-^-but saw no farther; at the time when the English .Government was being taught a lesson by its American possessions des tined to bear good fruit in the treatment of Australian colonies by succeeding English Cabinets, Port Chester Castle was a gaol for French prisoners of war. The little village of Portchester is on a neck of land jutting out towards the head of Portsmouth Harbor, and at the foot of a fine range of Mils. The hamlet, although the noisy railway engine puffs, and snorts, and shrieks its way to a rude railway platform close to the one street, still re tains all the peculiar rustic beauty of an English, village, while to the antiquarian .if;, has another charm, for it was here, s© many historians relate, that Vespasian first landed in Britain. But Port chester's chief attraction is its ruined castle. i2Die: fortress is of quadrangular form, and with its courts and surrounding: lands, covers five acres of ground. The old ruin is said to date from the. year375. Certain it is that the foundation of the cuter walls and semi-circular towers were ' irailtf by the Eomaas, but the Saxins and Normans, and: ]&fcer; .on, the early jEDglieh^t^dBs^of.awjMtecture,. represent many important, additions, and the~ different modes of these builders offer a delightfur study to the thoughtful tourist. Its walls are about -16ft in height, and from 8ft to lOf tin thickr ness. At its north-west corner stands a high Sasen, keep with two underground dungeons, and on three several storeys are three double apartmentsT With the exception of the top storey, which is lit by small Saxon windows, alTthese rooms have nothing but loop holes to lightthem. There is an inner court in the Norman sty!©, .with a forfci-, fied entrance portal and a portcullis; and there *re two other massive gates' to be passed, before clearing the castle grounds; each with a port cullis. The entrance passage Is vaulted; and there are perforations through: which in ancient times the castle's defenders could pour nioulten lead or hot water upon their assailants. -; ' '; Curing the last century, when the impartial writers of English history tell us that our' fore- fathers' wars with the- French filled English prisons with their captured enemies, the Govern ment patched up this ruin, garrisoned it, and sit one time lodged nearly 1000 French captives, in the castle. But at the time this story opens. Captain Tompion, the governor of the prison, had not more than 150 prisoners in hia charge; and only thirty soldiers to guard them. The captain was 62 years of age, and he had spent 50 years of his life in the service of his country, and performing that kind of service in that kind of way that enabled Britons, with some show of -reason, to sing 'Britannia Bules the Waves.' The captain was a poor man, and he had neglected in his young days to cultivate friends at Court; so that at 60, WnehThe was too old to get a ship, he was seated one day on a stool on the Common Hard ^at Portsmouth, won-^ dering what would become of his only daughter ifrolly, and cursing his poverty, ' [When the Borjb Admiral was- a boy Captain Tompion, who was then an active young mate, saved his life; but the old sailor was much .too proud to remind the young admiral of the obligation. But on the very day that . Captain Tompien_ was meditating, on. what would become of Dolly, the' admiral noticed him ' on the Cbnimon- Hsiid. -: -But the admiral did more; he remembered him, and his reeolk^tion of the^ obl^Brfaon that he was under to.

TonuV Dolly's ? version o'f him will have to serve the reader. i*he~ idea of saying anything, that might detract from Dolly's description of him might iivolve me at this time of the year in all sorts of complications: and unpleasant situations with Dolly's ghost. Because even Australia is not remote enough to be safe from ghostly, visitors at Christmas 'time, and spirits travel even faster than mail steamers. Briefly then, inafter'jyears^DoDymany times told her children thatTom at 23vwas.i;he ^beet looking and nicest gentleman in all England. ? When Captain Tompion first took the commands of Portchester Castle, ,,all tMt he Jmew of , Squire Bramber was that, that gentleman was fond.of fox-hunting and fonder Wpoirt wine, aiia.proua of his achievements in this direction. - Almost as proud of them as: he was of his position as a country squire and magistrate of a good county family, , But after a time Tom came home from Oxford* and after the first week, tired ot country pur suits, rode over to the oastle and there saw Dolly: Tom after thaij found an ^excuse to ride over: pretty often, and the interest he took in the poor French prisonerfe showed what a, kind-hearted fellow the young squire was. Of course it maybe supposed that Dolly was somewhat of an attraction to the young man. She1 was a very pretty girl* pert, a&d; something of a. flirt. Only 18, .fl.n.4 ^^ cojantrj-?bred;;Tshort and; plump, ana with. a: slightly ^^ turned jip nose.

'. - ; v :?-?? -?: CHAPTEB II. : Captain Tompion had a weakness. The bid sailor, who had served in so many battles, thought they would, have been all the better fought if he had had command of the British forces.

The -governor explained that in con sequence of his special instructions one precaution was necessary* Mr. Wilson's quarters were ap proached by a staircase ineide the tower. At the foot of these steps a guard of six men were, kept; and the sergeant in charge would receive orders that whenever Mr. Wilson- left7 his; rooms, and was about to pass out of the keep, he would wait until the sentry had given notice, and one of the guard had been detailed to 'follow him about the grounds at a respectful distance. Wi£b this little attention, and Mr. Wilson's . word that he would hold no converse with his fellow-prisoners, Ithe rebel and his guardians were' satisfied; and after some . conversation, in which the captain preached leyaliy, and the rebel appeared im pressed, Lieutenant Stock conducted Wilson te his rooms in the keep. - - ?'!???'? -t V ' While «bU tiiis was going onj Dolly liaafinistieu the pie, and had gone for her daily ramble about the jc&stle; groutide. , A few months before this time Miss Tompion would have, stopped the pie-making at the ap proach of visitors; and, after a hasty arrange ment of her curlsrand adjustment of her fineries, would have' found .an excuse — quite by accident, of, course— of going into the garden, and being introduced te the visitors. Especially if, as on this occasion, the maid had informed her that there was such a fine, handsome young man brought in as a prisoner--2-' none of your low French sailors, but a fine young gentleman with -iark eyes and beautiful teeth, and who spoke English like a native.' .But Dolly took no interest in the affair, and. went ?on with. her pie ?;„ and having finished itj* -went out to wander round the grounds.- '? r : : ,This'was.a:^r6rite pastiioe of hers. Dolly had beente a ^o6tf~ school at Portsmouth, and had learnt to speak* French pretty well, and this ac complishment she had greatly, improved by con versing with the prisoners. The men had little to do. A few of them were kept employed in the grounds or in rope-making; but the majority passed the time until they were exchanged in lying .about the grass. . Sentries were posted within sight of each other round the walls; but they troubled themselves very little about the captives, who knew they would be no better off * outside, 'for they could not have [ reached France if they had escaped. The governor's daughter . had been brought up ' among men;, and her father had no objection to her carrying small delicacies to old sick French men, or words of comfort to young prisoners whose days were passed in bemoaning the hard chances bf- wa'rthat kept them 'from their mothers or their' sweethearts. -^9fi3R?^y- ^Wg*. - a great favorite among the Frejjup^nen, with -whom she held much converse, and tj^yctalked to her of their homes, and the weepiag iwomeriiihey had left behind them. The casifte g&ard; loved Dolly, too, for she had often into#p@wjd between some defaulting soldier and tie'^i^moXd' disciplinarian — her father. And ^eutenant ^tock forgave old Tompion for bsing m.wj^^nd, though only a sailor, for the sake of pollyf^o the friendless old man had learned to love^as if she were his own child. But greatest proof of Dolly's power te make mea^ hearts soften towards her was in the fact ;tba|f®£ Beeves, who never spoke to any man or wo^.n5?^3iout levelling some biting sarcasm at ti^^^a^' '^b Jtcst, as an army and then as a pi^^^i^^on^iob^led upon all those who sought ;h^'T^^j^as3bnlyrsiSc/to avoid work, was always tendeijte J^olly, always willing to lend an ear, to ;her complaints, and even believed in and pre serihed fc)rjier ''sick headaches.' vsr- s - CEDAPTEE ILL ,. ThS^^*eBks after the arrival of the prfeoner, described in the last chapter, Dolly was making iher daj|3£tour of the grounds, when an incident occurred which very mtu:h startled the governor's daughter. The, governor, beyond periodical ?visits i6 the quarters of the American, had held little^ further iatfercourse with him, for Mi. Wilsoii:iiad shxraai ao improvement in the matter of hiskgjGalty; and Captain Tompion had long before' ^i^dvered from the remarks dropped by ?his prisoner that the spirit of rebellion was in, him -stillrand that Ius prophesy that he might become loyal from the governor's example was an idle compliment to. faig gaoler. ' : - The captain had ordered Dolly, to have nothing to say to this prisoner. ' You may talk to these poor-spirited but honorable Frenchmen,' said he, ?'* hut don't speak to that infernal rebel, my dear; he is, a very, dangerous fellow.' ; But the American often met Dolly in the \ castle grounds, and he. always bowed to her with sucE politeness that she could not help, after a time, wishing him a 'good morning' as she icurfeeysed. ;~. .jQneJday as she was wandering in aremote part of ^E?' g^P^ds, she suddenly encountered Wilson, jwlibse military attendant was following h^Tn some ;yar-isintherear. : £-9Zhe prisoner: raised his hat, and Dolly started and, barely managed to suppress a scream, as t^ilBon,^ with the utmost.coolness, said in French, iffpb not be alarmed Miss Tompion, I have some news for you about Tom Bramber.' Now, I am endeavoring to toll this simple story in the most approved style ; and have, there fore, only hinted that Tom Bramber had fallen in love with Dolly and then disappeared, and that Dolly hiad become a very unhappy young lady ; and the reader has. grown wearied and wished to goodness I would come to the point. -Well if he has not given up the story in disgust be fore coming to this part of it, he will now have some of this mystery cleared up. Dolly recovered herself after a moment, and answered the American. ' Sir,' said she, ' I do not. understand you.' And she said these . Tford^with an awt of great dignity. But of a sadden bursting into tears, she added, between her, sobs, .'Oh,' cak you— can 'you really tell me '., where fie is ? 1-^1— thatis, the squire is break ;ing his heart, f — ^f— for, he thought Mm d-^-d— d«aid36tgoneaway:for_ever.'

Tom 'OTeWf to- like^ me very much, beoause al ?thottgli I was a rebel, I was not a Frenchman, and Tijy-aud- bye we exchanged confidences. He told me of ttLe cause .of- his leaving home, and that there was a lady in the case; and when he heard that I too had a sweetheart- in- Virginia, waiting my return, vre became -bosom friends/* Miss Dolly blushed at this, and the admiring look in the American's eyes made it just as well,, perhaps, that his bosom Mend and the Virginian ,lady eouldnot seethe pair; for Dolly too, although her heart beat only for her absent lover, could not help thinking to herself that really the rebel was a very-handsome young man. 'You may judge how friendly we became,' continued he, 'when- 1 repeat the story as Tom told it to me. He said his father was a very proud -man, and had kept himself aloof from the govern©r of Portehester Castle until he discovered that his son had become a regular visitor to the place, and when he found this out, Tom told me that you Miss Dolly had already the half of a sixpenny-piece in your possession, and Tom was. wearing the other half next to his heart. So Squire Bramber guessed what was going on, and taxed Tom with having fallen in love with the prettiest little lady in England (only he did not have* the sense to put it in that way),' said the American, and Dolly blushed again and made a pretty little curtsey. ' And then Tom fired up and said it was true, and so was he, and so were you, and that nothing: -xmld separate you from him-^and many other pretty' things to the same effect, all of which I have said myself of the lady in Virginia.' From the admiring look of Mr. Wilson, a shrewd observer might have thought that he would have cared very little if the lady in question had been even further away than Virginia. Or if it had been possible for an . American rebel te be so very much of a gentle man, this Virginian lady might have been a fic tion, which, he had introduced te put Dolly more at ease,, while he told her her own love story. ' When the squire told Tom that he had deoided he should marry a certain rich young lady in. the neighboring county, and that if his son did not obey he would cut off the rebellious rascal with a shilling, old ' Bramber forthwith mounted his horse and rode over to ,the castle, where he saw your father, and the pair had high 'words, and were very nearly adjourning to the castle grounds to settle the young people's love affair withdrawn swords. The squire told Captain Tompion that his son could not marry Miss Dolly, and Captain Tom pion replied that he was of the same opinion. It was the first he had heard of their love affair ; and although his family was as good as the squire's, he would take care that his daughter should not . marry young Bramber. The squire rode away, having accomplished this piece of -mischief, and on his return began again at Tom. The pair became very angry with, eachother, and the younger mau left his father's house that evening, and they have never seen each other since. Tom came over to the castle and took a tearful farewell of you, Miss Dolly, for Jie had made up his mind to join the navy as a volunteer and make some money, and then come back and claim you for his wife. I need hot repeat to you all the promises each made to the other to faithfully wait till Tom could marry. I have told you enough Miss Dolly to show you how much I am in Tom's confidence. When you parted with him on ihaif evening he went to Portsmouth, and, on the following day was sailing down the Channel. All his hopes of making money speedily, arid returning to you, were soon dashed to the ground. The ship ne was on board of was attacked and defeated by my friend and fellow-rebel, Captain Paul Jones, and Tom was carried, wounded and a prisoner, into Cherbourg, where I met him. Now Miss Dolly, there is. a sequel to my story, and when you have told me what has happened since poor Tom went away, I will relate this sequel, which I do assure you is the most important part , of what I have to say.' '. Then Dolly, with.' tears in her eyes, after some hesitation, told' him how, after Tom left, the squire grew very miserable and cursed himself for having driven Tom away from home. A few weeks afterwards Mr. Bramber heard that the rich lady who he had determined that Tom should marry had married someone else. Then it was that the squire came up to the castle and made friends with. Captain Tompion and forgave his daughter for having won Tom's love. And after a time the squire grew to love Dolly and spent a great deal of his time with her father, and tney were all friends together, and would be happy if they could only have Tom back. For the squire declared that the banns should be put up for his boy's marriage with Dolly on the very day that his Bon returned. But the old man was very doleful, for he feared that he would not see poor Tom again, and Dolly, too, had no idea where he -was until that very day. , When Dolly had completed this story the American said, ' Miss Tompion ; when I left Cherbourg I promised Tom I would do what I could .to procure his release. . But a few days afterward I was in the same plight as he is now, for the ship I was' on board of was captured in the Channel, and they brought me prisoner here. As soon as I heard that this was Portchester Castle, and saw the people Torn has so often de scribed te me, an idea entered m.y head, and I determined on a plan to help you if I could. But you must hot forget that in the eyes of your Government I am a most dreadful rebel, and I have given them some reason to think so. , In consequence of this I shall have difficulty inhelp ing Tom, but with your aid we mav do some thing.' ?'', - : 'Oh, Mr. Wilson,' said Dolly, 'if you can do anything to make the poor old squire happier, and to. help Tom— and me, we shall all be bo grateful. I— I will never — never forget you— your kindness.' . 7 tc The first thing you must remember is to keep all this a strict secret from your father and his. officers,' replied Wilson, ' as you know they look upon me as a great villain, because I am an American, and my plans must be kept entirely to yourself, if yon wish to see Tom released.'
