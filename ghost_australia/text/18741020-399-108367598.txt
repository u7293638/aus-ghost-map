Her. sorrowing: husband stood by her bedside^ also tinder the ImpressioQ that he must soon part from .his beloved one for eyer. ThewiFe evidently had something^ prey ing on her mnid, ^and was mentally struggling! under alternating desire and reluctance to dis close it. At last the near approach of the prim monster so' terrified, her that she exclaimed.: Jphn, dear, when I am gone search, and you will find -some money-int my stays." This so: startled John that; .he forgot this sorrow for; thfe moment, and he began to search for the treasure' in the stays.. Jtwas found, cut out* and he had the consolation of .looking on i£S50inBank of England notes.. ! The pleasure that beamed on John's countenance, -on -the -discovery,' stems to have bad a beneficial: effect on his; wife,* for she£at once began ito. mend; Whether- since her recovery she bas aegreited the premature disclnsure pfher secret is notiknpwn. - it is said she brought, the money into the^colony with her ten years ago..> i Who will say a woman cannot keep a secret,?" u - Within-one ^nonth, -from: the completion of' the first house in'Pithole. city, Pennsylvania, that city had ;.a telegraph office'and hotel, costing tl)e ; month more, there wasa d^ly paperiratablished, and in the jaext a; theatre^' in: another moMh; another theatre,;and then an academy of music. In six mpnths there, were seventy-four^ hotelfe and boarding-houses i ? in .the seventh month the city had Teached; its ihighest: prosperity^ - It then had 15,000 people, . elaborate water-works, a city hall,;and;an expensive-city government." Then occurred the completion of labour-saving enterprise-rrrthe sorcalled Miller Farm Pipe'line .-by which ihe petroleum was sent off indepeti~ dent of tlje, labouring population. yAt'ohce 4,000 pers while 2,000. houses became useless.- This ^ais: the death-blow: to; Pithole. At once the hotels, the theatres, -and, the telegraph office were closed, and the -daily paper gave *ip its ghost^ while almost every, one packed up his trunk arid moved out.,; Only nine families remain-out of a population 0^15,000 souls, while -the railrdad from Pithoje to Oleopolis :ruhs only one train- a day, consisting of {^locomotive and &i; single -car, which is usually, empty - but the. Company^ obliged to keep,running, otherwise the i charter^ for the road would-,be lost.: They still hope against hope for bgtteri times for that unfortu nate city, . which in ' only;. seven months ' was born, full-grown, got sick, - and died.

In order, apparently, to further the education ef her eldest boy, she engaged a Free Chur«.h divinity studeat as tutor, with whom, she became very intimate. Ultimately she removed from her lodgings in the village, and took up quarters nearer the residence of the tutor in Newington. By-and-by the tutnr received an appeintment as missienary to a] station in an important town in the north, which he had not long occupied before he was-followed by the lady. The intimate relations and fre quent communications which took place between the parties became the subject of talk auiongst the gossips of -the towirrhut nothing of asus pi^ipus nature was suspected until, the parties .were traced to London. It is said that they ?have gone to America, hut nothing hasyet been . ?definitely ascertained in Edinburgh as, to\\.their whereabouts. The five children havebeen ; left i behind. It is also said that'the lady willhave . £700 in her own right in the event. of. certain circumstancesoccurring. : It is ako said that the husband of the lady will arrive in Edinburgh ! about the beginning of next,month, and that;the case will then most likely come before the law courts.
