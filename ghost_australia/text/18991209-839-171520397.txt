Cleverness in Conversation. A man well known in society says that to be clever at conversation one must have a good memory. He must keep in mind so much as be knows of the tastes and prejudices of thosex present ' As you said the other day,' is a good way tn Introduce a tmngent remark : or, 'As your favourite author has it,' which shows a flattering regard for one's re ferences. All these tricks, if you call them so, must be studied. Don't try to make a man think how clever you are. Make him think bow clever he is. Brighten him up. Lead bim on to say witty things. You may even coax him up to a joke, be he as glum as Pharaoh's ghost. Bemind him of clever things he said 'the other day.' Never mind if the}- are inventions of your own. Never mind if he knows the?* are ; so long as he does not imagine that yon know if they are all right. Tell bright things about him. It won't take long to make him feel, especially if be is a really dull fel low, that he is a great deal smarter than oven he thought himself. A man is apt to frizzle under the fire of your own humour, and wit, and brightness, and of course a man is never comfort able when he frizzles.
