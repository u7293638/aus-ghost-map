LADY, AWAKE ! The sun ls flooding tho eastern sky With ablaze o√≠ silver light ; The fresh green foliage, waving high, Is fringed with flame of white ; And far above, from tho topmost air, Tho showering lark-notes break ; And tho spirit of beauty floats everywhere Swoet my lady, awake ! Tho river that lay in its dusky repose Through tho long lono hours of night, Now laughs in the lustro that sunrise throws, And ripples in rosy light : And tho lulls that loomed like shadowy ghosts A clearer outline tako ; And tho white sails glimmer along tho coasts Dear my lady, awake ! Tho violet lifts its eye of blue To the bending blue above And the roses, bathed in a drench of dew, Are breathing of beauty and lovo ; And tho lily stoops its head to kss Its shadow within the lake O never was morning so lovely as this ! Dear my lady, awake ! Awake ! for music is flooding tho air, And melting along the deep. When nature is all awake and so fair, O, why should my lady sleep ? A passionate sigh bogins to start l'rom the depth of each thicket and brake A sigh that finds echo within my heart O, sweet my lady, awake ! Awake ! and come where tho zephyr moves In ripples across tho grass : Awako ! and como to tho lake that loves To mirror your form' as you pass ; And come, O come to tho heart that pines And languishes for your sake And bright eyes shall blind each dow-drop that shines Dear my lady, awake.
