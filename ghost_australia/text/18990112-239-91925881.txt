ORIGI.VA L POETRy. A GHOST OF A GLIMPSE OF ir_ BY BEN SU\\. Out on the confines of Nevcrlandl Out in the regions of light, There is the poet's Forever-land Shining eternally bright. 'lhere flowers are eternally springing And joy-bells fr er are tinliln And love is a-sminng and singing A song of immortal delight. There sunset has never a sorrowv, And rusting regret has no morrow, And care can no capital borrow To canker the day or the night. But words are a weary enleavour To follow where feeling 's supremes. The land of the poet's Forever is a bright and a beautiful dream.
