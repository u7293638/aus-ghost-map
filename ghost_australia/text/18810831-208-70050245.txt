SNAKE CHARMING IN BARODA. The following story of snake charming has been sent to the all M?,ll seGtte by a corre spondent who is making a sketching tour through some of the States of North-west India: One morning I was strolling with a friend in the verandah, when we saw a strange ti?lre coming along the drive-a tallish man, in a scarlet turban, only, unlike the usual solid turban, it was wound serpent wise about his head: a kind of loose. flame-colouredl shirt; a loin cloth, and the onvruarv peaked shoe of the Easterns. Across his shoiltders he carried a stout bamboo pole between 5ft. and 6ft. long, at either end of which hun' two hags of coarse woven cloth, colored a ltnt vivid flame color. As he came up to us we saw he had long black hair, twisted up like a woman's, and secured at the left side by a heavy silver comb, whose back was chasÂ«[ in strange patterns, and shaped like a curvamn a sna.4s body. In his ears were delicate car. rings of silver, silver rings set with small green and red and white stones in flower-like shapes: on his forehead was the red mark of the Hindoo ; across the bridge of the nose, between the eyes, there was a black and scuarlet fine -irant that looked like a tiner -iL. riband, and a similar riband ran from the outer corner of each eye to the temple. His face gave you the impression of his having been alive sincoe the flood; his eyes looked as if they ld not shut; yet he hd a i wrinkle, and was evidently ynn?n ? hands were beautifully shaped, with dh l nails; his feet were strong and shaply + `fir friend'said."Thu man wi1 a ?'= some fin fora few copper." So hbe e, up to the verandah, and the play be-au p opened hisa.har. sat down on his ha and proceeded to unpack. The hap iamed each a large wicker, or rther?, ;i~ lath basket, and nondescript bhndi` many-colored cloth. The late.r cont,;t:, tin box full of live and lively secrpin?t. ? necklaces of strange grey and res ,, pieces of wood suppoe to be cure, lfr pion bites; round black euhLar.tc _ shining buttons-these are snae ston , if laid on a cobra bite are papsed to.. it. The baskets contained alho laoi "c apiece. He took out the two cahra, ?ia them on the stone oo0r of the vern. I: am not quite sure if he.showedl u tw eC, at :first, for he has been here many, ? since. At any rate, he took a cnt ncO " it squirm about on the fcor:: thc t. doced from his bag a weird pilt, r:e i' goard, and shaped something like a .a - The lower part, below the bell i, pi with boles, on which the fingcern plawy this 'pipe he began the most phli na; ever was heard : the 'cohra renl or.-. about, and gradually raised itself aon . swelled out its hood, and elnwly w?a awful head to and fro in front of thi?e.: Suddenly the music made a will. yell, and " was not;" the cohra', ,?es down, and his hood shrunk into not t:: The demon snake-man then r?s? pointing to a big boy, a servant of mV:ri " I will bring a cobra out of that h.',: The boy had on a close-fittin,. por-.pe a his head was shared, and the r-t of clothing consisted of a shirt.

Suddenly, agai, the nsinsic and the man began to take on f ci si; He appeared for a moment. u Iii:ir-, there wasn't the ghost of a snake abi:e He shook out all his clothes-no sna?e - wrapped his loin cloth round him, acl re again his devil's dance and his svm?i. pipe.
