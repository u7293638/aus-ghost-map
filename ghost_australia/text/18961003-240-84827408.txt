For tie rest, he might be any oge from thirty to forty-five, and any one meeting him in tihe street might take him for n officer of cavalry. i The guest owrites down the address and tgain rises withl the evident intention of taking his leave. Vizard comes ronnd from his seat to accompany him to the hall, but once more he wrho has been called Sir Simon hesitates, and with a quick nervous gesture detains his host from leaving the roomn. The latter stops short with his hand on the dooer, and, towering over the shrinking figure, invites further questioning tith a mere elevation of the eyebrows. "It'all seems so riskiy," faltered the elderly man. "How should I open up negotiations with Nathan-for what you call aspecial nrrngement. I mean-with out fear of compromise 0" Vizard takes from his vest pocket a little Seheaf of cards, neatly blended together, Sand, selecting one, icnds it to hIis guest. '"G'ive him that." he says. "Nathan will understand that you mean business and \- are properly introduced. You need tell him nothing beyond the name, and do nothing but pay what he asks. The terms are high, but may bhe regarded in the light of lan investment. There will he absolutely nothing in. writing. It is the essence of the system to take all risks without com Spromise to clients." Sir Simon glances at the card. It it blank, save for a red heart pierced with a 'ilack arrow. "Good God, how horriblel -a sort of modern letlre de caochet," he says, shnddering. "Acd you are sore, SVizard, that this will he ellctive--that there willbe no hitch ? It would be terribleo to tempt fortune in such a way-and fail." There is a touch of amusedcontempt in Visrad's tone as ha reclies, "There are no failures. If Miss Challenor taken the trip under the speoml ormongement, Iher health will receive the attention you requiro for her." Witll these words he opens the door as (hough there is nothing more to be said, and leads his figest dowrnstairs to a splendid entrance-hlcl, where two fcotmen spring quickly to attention. .no comes forward witil Sir Simon's hat nad inveernss cape, and the other flinge .open the front door to smcmon thie wait isg brougham, A fet worde of common place fare'll ore exchinged, and the ar'riage rolls oawiy, leaving Vizard gazing sfter it from the top step withi an in ernthable smile.

The Flower Line of steamaships. os every one knows, plies betweeu London and Calcutta, touching at the chial lfediterr.mneu ports; and the little in. nident which gave those grim old hunksea in the Roard-room the chance to get theh toitec into me occurred on tholoet voyage nut. oWe had left London on a Tuesndy after noon, and all went well till the folloring Thursday morning, when we were steering a steady fifteen knots across tile mouth the Channel. Itas myn w tch,ondeocept for thle quorrtersater. whlo wos steering, ] nso alone spon the bridge, the captain being h t breakfast in the saloon. The weather was thick, with a nasty choppy sea, and tile third officer, who shared my l srge of the deck, was forsard on tile fo'.atlo seeing tfhst the loeok-ot moni didn't go to sleep. Suddenly my earn werestartled by a scrunc ing crsth from, as far s 1 oerd juldge about twre undred yards off on the port beamo. followed by screens and shouts whilh told me as plain ps words coull spent tirt two rvessels waere in coellision cloes at hansd. Almost at the ano s momlent the Iz roke e little, r and sthed me the blact hull of a steam.coller rslinkipg awy to the aestward, and a eo:mrt. yw-awirigged y.cht ct t dovn to the water's ce, and with sc?reely a u inute to float. r altered the "Dahlia's" course so as to ring her round toe the sinking craft, Eing ing out at the same time to tise third oelicer to clear awoy a esat. As we neared the acht t oueld see tht all was confusion on rahde, ando onder; ler eon boat was stove i, oand the raseally eollier, instead of standing hy to help, wns nlready out of sight is tin e mist. To cossk snatters terorse, I caeght sight of ladies on tlhe loping. detk, and 1 hknew that unless the yowl floutcd a fear minutes longer they cotld be in danger, since our ship came reouend but nlowlyona jammed hel. Ir was keeping one eye on the men en asged in lorerig the boat and the other on the yacht, when she plunged forward, then staggered bck nnd wrent down stern foremost, leaving her people strurggling in tlhe sea. O hr boat was still t tle duavit, the freshly-painted gear worhing stiffy. nd it olll seo that any one who was not ao trong.swimsmer would be hsept away and drowned before they could tc picked ep. It wa no time to reckon rlesn and consequences, and almost before I knew what i nos going to do my shoes were icked loff and r ad toaken a header from the bridge. Or ship hatd greatly reduced the dins tance, and na fetw strokes brought me to the scene of the disaster, nwherae bout a secore of people awere keeping themselves soot in the best nway known to them. Luckily the yahot wase too small to have suckted them downr. An elderly gentleman in flannels, with a life-bhlt on, wons hanging on to i aser, and a man who looked like the sailing. master as r supporting a lady who, was tscreaming at te topn of her voice some word wlhic I could not make out. The rest-all men, and evidently the crew were snwirming strongly towards thie " Dahlia." I wns beginning to think tlhat t lad been rather too officious, when a dreggled whisp of blue serge, rising in the voter between ee and tile gentleman on the spar, caused me t change my nind and feel glad that I had come. It was the insensible form of a whomdn. floting limply to thse surfco for theo first time after immersion, nod on the point of siningo nagin, when I omnged tso gNurb her by the arm. I noticed nomore than that she wa young and lay aquite featherweigfht in my enmr.ee, for my chiel concern wais now with thle arrival of tlhe bhot. Looking round, I was glad to sec it coming taocards us fast. while thle" Dfalia herself wans standing on at querter speed lest she should run dowsn tle yacht's crew, who were nlready reaelhing leer side. Seeing horw I as haempered, the thirdl ofieer steered his beoat straight for us, and ufter picking us up went on for the sailing. master nnd his turden, last oa all tat;ing in thee man on tle spar.i Firve minutes ltreer were all safe on beoard the "ipeahli," and the two ladies, wheo were alone the worse for tile accident. were handed over to our surgeon and stenordess. The pssengerso who aad come up from the saloon to nitnaes the rescue, rorwded rounde woaith tise usunl fse Iof congratulation and curiosity. so that an other ten minuter passed behfore I cold slip into dry clothes and join the captain on tle bridge. Ie stroot hands eitlr me starmly, buthe nwas looking as solemn asa " This is going to end badly, Forrtsatr. I o, nfraid,"l e said. " You only did what any decent chap avould haove done, hut on knowr s wellas Ido that it won dead against the rules. To leave the bridge with no one in charge is a heinoun crime with the wiseoeres of Lecadenhall Street, and I ar bound to log theo incident." "'I never govCa the rle an tloouet," I said. "and I don't helievo it woulg ha?e maode noy difference if I had." There having been no loss of life,the ex citement so6n calmed down, and we stood on our course sosuthward. It was ascer tained that the sunken yacht "Norah" had been chartered for a ch.tnnel cruise by Sir Simon Crawshay, the elderly san wh had saved lemself by clinging to a spar, and that the ladies avere reapectively eis sister, Iers lteuhnamp, and his card. Miss Aline Challenor, the latter being the girl whom I hadmoanged to pick up. In tho course of the morning I heard that Miss Chalienor had quickly revived under the ssrgeon's treatment, and that Sir Simon Isad decided to go on in the 5 Dahlia" to Naples, whence he would be able to take hisparty home overland moreuepoditiouoly than from Gibraltar. r saw no more of the ladies that day, bht during the afternoon, beingcff doty, I was talking to some of our own paseongers on dock. when Captain Ileateon passed in con vernation nith Sir Simon. The latter hod been fitted with dry clothes by some lpu nonger, ann he appeared to be none tle sorseforhesdip. icannotsaythatltool much of a liking for the moo. I saw by the furtive wy hIe kept his eyes askance that he had recognised meo, and one woold have thought that under the circumstances he would have wished to say something civil. Dut they passed and repassed several times on their promenade. Sir fimon always at that moment finding an object of interest at the other side of the deck, and Captain Beotson too busy with his discussion to notics surroundings. At sbout the fifth turn, however, the skipper's eyes chanced my way, and he at onsc hrought his companion to a halt, introdut lag me as the oeficer who got Miss Challenor into the eat.f Iow though s eome of a fairly decent ?aully spysoif, my fatherl having been , elergyman and the grandson of a poor., went to sea so early that my'dcalisgse ith thsaristocracyhnvek"ebeu limited. Imam therefore not sure whuther Sir Simon Crawshay's manner towards myself arose from hlue blood or frosm a blr.cL hcart i tut oven if it eas in/ra .1g. for a baroueet to entend his gratitude to a more onlcer in the Merchant Serviee, I thoeghlt it singular thant he shaould show such callousness about his ward's escape. "Oh, indeed I very interesting, snd all that sort of tising.

Aline would not come ofage for n year, and in the meanwhrile. under her father's will, she was not permitted to take any.step without her gRurdirau's sanction, though in our new-tosnd hlappiness we paid but little heed to possible opposition from that qtuarter.
