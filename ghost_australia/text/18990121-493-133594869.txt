POETRY. ANDANTE. 'Yonr fingers sweep the beys and then By river reach and iris fen The long dead days come back again. Smile on me once again, and bo Waffc me 00 music soft a^id low Down the far 0elds of long ago. 'Where lonely sunsets blow and fade For one whoaB hauntGd heart has strayed At evening to the upland glade, Where he can hear the wild geese cry Ae.roBB tho solitary sky, And tho cold bw eepin'g winds go by With broken words that laugh and weep, Like someone troubled in hia sleep By visions of the calling deep. Strange forest-girded lakes, whose moods Lie hidden in far Bolitudes Where no irreverent foot intrudes; Black tossing rapids, through whoso roar A vague great voice forevermore ' Goes echoing from shore to shore; All phaBes of that wilderpeBB WhoBe close communion used to bless My boyhood in its lonelinesB ; All these acroBS roy spirit's ken Swept by on waves of sound, and then — A sharp sweet chords — they fade again. The wandering ghostB have found their tomb; And here, within this shadowed room, Yonr gold hair glitters through the gloom.
