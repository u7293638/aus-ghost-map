A Spectacled Ghost. Some amateurs gave a performance of "Hamlet." Smith was Hamlet. The day after the performance Jones met Smith and asked: "How did the performance go off last night?" "Everybody did well except old Penny* bunker. I'll be hanged if he goes on the stag* with me any more. I'll take him and tie him on the railway track and let the train run over him before he shall play Ghost to my Hamlet any more." " Was he the Ghost?" " Yea, and the blooming old idiot stalked aoross the stage with his spectacles on. He made a oiroua of the whole affair. If ever there was a melancholy Dane I was one. I haven't got over it yet. And the old graven image says he put on his speos to add to the solemnity of the scene," A new anthem, composed by a village organist, was being performed by the village choir and chorus, with this effect. The soprano started off with the very laudable, though rather startling, an nouncement : " I will wash." Straight way the alto, not to be outdone, declar ed she would wash. Then the tenor, finding it was the thing, warbled sweetly, that he also would wash. And the deep chested bass, as though calling up all hlB fortitude for a plunge, bellowed forth the stern resolve that he would wash as well. Next came a short inter lude on the organ, strongly suggestive of escaping steam and splashing waves, after which the choir, first individually, and then collectively, asserted the firm, unshaken resolve that they would wash. At last they solved the problem by stating simultaneously, and with evident earnestness, that they proposed "to wash their hands in innocency."
