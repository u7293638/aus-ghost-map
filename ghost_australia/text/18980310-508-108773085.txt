'Well, I'm with you^at last. The thing did seem outrageouslyHl^ng; put on! your wraps, Puss.' and he turned the key in the desk at his side, and took his hat from its hook. ? ?'' L¥J 'Rat-tat-tat.' Rene's face clouded, in Mstantly. 'Oh, dear!' she ejaculated,'' and then, catching her brother's arm, ;sajd, be fore he could .call out the usual 'Come in:' ' 'Chart, if it is anyone on business I will ! go. on.' Her brother nodded,--, ,. and'-;; called ! upon the visitor to enter. But his' own face j had clouded. -.:???., ;--? i 'I'll make short work of whoever it may be, sister,' he half -whispered, as;; the door opened slowly, and then he wentffprward to ' meet his visitor, while Rene, sljpped past 1 them and out into the moonjight..r Only a j step, however; then, as someone aaonfroiited j her, and put out his hand with the assured ! aii- of a proprietor, she caught Tier breath, ] and then cried softly: ' ' j . 'Oh, Ken! It is you! How could you?' I 'How could I do what?' tucking 'her hand j beneath his arm, and turning away from the j dOOr. nj.-.s :-:?; ? I 'Bring that man. Did you' 4iring him, Ken?' * n 'I don't understand, dear; I .be^aji'to think I something might be detaining' qharlie, and ! I felt too impatient to wait.'? '?'''.,'' I 'Oh,' she murmured, quite satisfied -now: j 'you were right; someone, some1' odious i stranger, eaine in upon us just at 'the' last ! moment, and so I left them there/* =? '. Charles Brian was the most affable of i editors, but to-nig-ht he greeted his visitor \ with a preoccupied countenance, and a i faint and frigid smile. He had worked hard * all the day to enable himself to give a small ! portion of it, and the hours of the evening, ?' to his friend Kenneth Baring, who had re- i turned from New Orleans gfijtigj'aj^^peet-1'] edly, and taken himself and p^^Sipt} as j well as the Barings upon the ???'?finis,- a£om- ] pletely by storm. His visit was sh'br^'knd] he made no secret of his. purpose. He|^ad^ come a- wooing, and he meant to tike? the'-i promise of Rene Brian back, with him to the '- southern city, where he was laboring hard to \ earn for himself a new name and build ai new home, independent of the Baring gold. There was much to be said, for Kenneth prized, next to the love of the sister, the friendship of the -brother; and .time wiis,.fly% Ing, for to-morrow he was to, i'fur-n''' his' face1'! southward, after paying a flying visit to the j city, where he must investigate certain new j inventions in surgery, for young. Baring was studying medicine and surgery under the tutelage of one of the brightest attl kindliest masters of the healing art to be fount! in all New Orleans. ? ' ; - At another time, perhaps, Rufus 'Carnes and Charlie Bryan might have:found in each other congenial spirits, but to-night the edi- ! tor's thoughts were intent upon vuigf s^ter j and his friend, and Carnes appeared* to' Tiim only as an intruder whom he must hear po- ; litely and. if possible, . dismiss speedily. ; j At any other time he would have felt and j manifested more sympathy and interest in j the fate of Bertha Warham and her step-] mother, but to-night, with his mind full of'; his beautiful sister and her new happiness. ] the name of this other lost afid, wayward' j girl cameras an unpleasant shoc^.llje want-',] ed to keep them apart, and to the euiflie felt' i -^ that he must not go too deeply into the -de- J tective's business; he must not 'let himself ] go.' .:. He listened to Carnes's story— it was told briefly — with chill interest, and took the] anonymous letter without comment* \ 'But ! when he had read it he pondered a moinent, and then read it again. 'Pardon me,' he said; then, with less fri gidity and more interest, 'may. I ask just what you expect to learn from me — just what you suspect, or hope, from : this in quiry?' _;. , - ; 'My errand should be patent to you, I ttilht; I want to find the author of this mis sive. I fancy he may not have told the whole story.' - - :-'?'.. 'But the letter says distinctly that the writer has gone.' ?'???? ? ~ ? ? -i 'The man who writes an anonymous let- i ter might well indulge in some fiction of that 'sort to protect his incognito,' said Carnes, with a smile. 'Oh! and you think that the writer of this letter is still in Roseville!' 'I think it possible.' ? ' Brian glanced at the letter; '3djtich be stiill * held, for the third time; then he.ihanded it back to the detective. . ? : ''- 'I wish I could help you,' he.-sa&Y; '-'W1^, * know of no one living in Rosesiil&^tio, to my knowledge, ever knew either this man-^ Joe Larsen or Bertha Warham. The letter, to me, looks like a genuine honest effort to ' tell you the little known to the' ''writer^ and at the same time to protect himself from further trouble or annoyance., in sthe case. You must admit that, to a stranger! one who may at this time be hundreds of miles away, the possibility of a legal summons, jipitu all its attendant hindrances, its^alfeoltftepT^usi ness losses perhaps, such a letter ''as' 'ttafs might have seemed a simple and '-easy way to tell all that he knew, to ease^Ws^ consci ence, and yet protect himself from 'tJSose' pe culiar courtesies which the law' sometimes pays a reluctant and innocent witness at a distance.' v.':-rx7. v' 'And this is all you will say ^v:'v : *Ttf is all I can say. As you have said, the writing is disguised, and well 'disguised. I cannot recognise it. I never saw tins, writ- ing. It is my belief that it is ap jfonest let ter; that the writer has told; you , all that he knows.' * ' . v- w'-fi: ?? ? ? Carnes stuffed the letter bacjOhto his poc ket, and arose. :--f. is ^In my experience,' he sai^,f'mi anony mous letter thai is honest frbni jBrst to last, . that has nothing, sinister or trjq,kyya.wqrd or motive, that does not conceal' mofe than it tells, is a thing unknown.' He took Ms hat and moved back. 'However, I' see that I have your ultimatum; I shall gef no further , information from you.' He paused for just a perceptible moment, and their eyes met; those of Carnes were full of meaning, while ... Brian's met them clear,- calm, Mffling.. .--. 'You have my ultimatum,, certainly;' :he. jsa id, bowing his visitor out while he. spoke. 'Of anonymous letters I have, had little ex perience.' .j^;**^-*— So they separated, and Carnes went bak3? to the little hotel, vexed, and notfe^tfie wise?; little dreaming that, for the first time, he, had been -within a hand's reaih jof : & ISrfimjsT ing clue. . ;J-f $\irt*J± , ;h Late that night, when Kenneth Baring h'ad said good-bye, and gone away conqueror, leaving his fair betrothed at once happy and sad, and with no desire to go to her room and to sleep, Brian sitting beside hec, wearyy yet willingly waiting her pleasure^ and fully in sympathy with her mood, Jjethougit him to teli her of his visitor.

'If you are going to extol him, brother mine, I will oven hie me to my. repose. Mr. Jermyn is capable of stranger things than these, mark me, Fir.' The next morning saw the two detectives on their return journey, and by the same train went Kenneth Baring. All were smo kers, and as Carnes was in an unsocial mood Stanhope after a time found himself next to young Bai-ing, r.nd chatting freely with him. That two such natures should fraternise I was a mailer of eom\se. Stanhope had wit- j nessed Baring's farewell with Charles Brian and knew him for a 'Bariug of the Hills.' and Brian had pointed out Carnes to his i friend and mentioned his visit of the pre vious night. After a few desultory remarks had been exchanged. Baring said: 'If you will allow me to introduce myself I would j be glad lo talk with yon on the subject which I understand has interested yourself and your friend here, to the extent of bring ing you to Roseville. Do you prefer to keep yourself, incog — or—' j Stanhope broke in with a frank laugh, j 'Excuse my interruption, Mr. Baring; you I see I already know yon. And for myself. I j have no reason for desiring to hold myself j incog just. now. if I could. My friend and j I have been looking into a little matter con- j liected with the Warham affair, and there has' been no especial attempt at secrecy; it's only in romance that you find the detective j ^always posing as a mystery; an open course i ; is often a. winning; one in real life, and if | /you have any ideas to air, or if you know j .'any of these parties— why, lire away, go j [ahead. I'm a geed listener.' . ' - -,,_:?; Baring laughed in.,. his turn. 'You take .me. up with a vengeance.' lie said. 'I knew r 3ions- ot. the , parties. . and I only saw . Bertha j'Wariiam once, and that nearly four years j ago. when, sho was hardly more than a child,' ?? '. ? ? ? \V '?;.' . ' y'.:'r':0\ ' 'Oh!

'She did impress me. decidedly; it was at t'sL' parly— a'~.reguTa'!r Country .' merry -making. j Probably she was the youngest girl there, j certainly she* was -the prettiest, and she j showed us a, sample ' of her spirit that | night.' . - . .] . 'In what way?' .....' . . -'.'. '' i ' 'Twill tell you it; just as ;i saw it. I was standing: with a group of young people, ail chatting gaily .while waiting for our various conveyances ? to be brought to the door; it j was at the close of the party. It had chanced j. that, I. had not been presented to the little I beauty; she was too fully monopolised to ' : leave a . chance,- for me; I was. in fact, a stranger, and looker-on. . But she happened ' [ to be standing very near me, and was talk | ing and laughing inenily. when a big fellow, j muffled and ready for the road, made his ? way among us, and we all knew at once that f-he was under the influence of liquor. He ] j cume close to Miss Warham, and said very i brusquely: 'Ready to go home?' Quick as j thought she whirled about and faced him. ['I am ready to go home.' she said haughtily. *5u~t not with you! Stand aside!' He was l-.between her and the door, but he fell back j as if he were dazed, and the girl went past j him, past all of us, like an enraged princess. ! She did not hasten, nor look to left or right. The fellow '''broke into a string of oaths, and someone half -led. . half -dragged him into another room, just as rny companions called me with others of our party.' 'And did you never hear the sequel, or who the fellow was?'' 'I think, without doubt, it ' 'was - Larsen. Afterwards I was told that he had pledged himself not to drink while in her company, and she had warned him what the i-esult I would be if he failed to keep his word.' ] ??And that,' said Stanhope, in a murmur ing tone, 'was Bertha Warham in her early j:teens.'' -Then, after a moment of silence, j 'and you never saw her again?' 'I never saw^ her again.'' '--s^v, i;When the two 'parted, tipofi'4 reaching the city, they shook hands'Avarmiy/' and Baring ;proffered ^ his,, JKew Orleans address. 'We j may'mee't again,' lie said. 'Perhaps some I time I niay^-eipen-JjeMjf some use to you; at ..any rate, should :you want, to .--see - me,-- this ; wilL tell you where to lobk me up.' And now began, another period of vexation land tediousness for our friends Carnes and j]; Stanhope: To visit Joseph Larsen, to watch Sharp and his men, to keep an eye upon everything und everybody in the remotest way connected 'with the Warham mystery, was all that seemed open to them; and with all their vigilance they could hit upon no^ new fact, possibility, or hope. Bertha War ham's picture had been sent in many direc tions, and after a week or more letters of acknowledgment, letters accepting the com mission and letters rejecting it, began to come in, but no one had seen Bertha War Kam; no one could give news of her. One of the iflrst to reply to a letter, which had enclosed one of the pictures of the miss ing one, was a certain reporter resident in Philadelphia, and by name Luis Moses. Mr. Moses's card had been given Stanhope. j by a city reporter who knew him in a busi j ness way, and it was Stanhope who had ad !- dressed him on -the. subject of. the search. ' Mr. Moses bad received Mr. Stanhope^s 'interesting' letter, and in any other way would ? be glad to oblige a gentleman 'of whom he had heard so favorably,' but he 'must beg to be excused. Under no circum stances could he so far stretch the limits of his profession as to lend a hand in the pur suit of a young woman, whatever her fault or crime.' In his capacity of reporter for the 'Evening Hailstorm,' however, he would willingly, 'most willingly,' report the affair fully and completely when Mr. Stanhope should see fit to entrust him with a matter which, of course, he 'looked upon, until otherwise informed, as a secret of the ^officers of the law.' ? ? And Mr; Moses was 'Fraternally yours, etc:, Luis Moses.' ''TEat Jew is a fraud,' pronounced Carnes, contemptuously,- 'when Stanhope read him ?tMs ietter. 'I'm willing 10 bet someihir.g ' /&&* lie is* a ri'tjorrer ^--c what there is in it, ;and don't you forget it. I notice that he : t^on't send, back, the picture of that .'.young i.'^Kcman.'

'Since writing you last a strange thing has happened: I have seen the lady of wh6m you are m search;— I am sure of it, and my eyes are very good ones Upon reflection I decide that I may have mistaken my duty in this case. In explanation of my change of con duct, will only say Uere that, in thinking of the voung woman you wished. to find, I pic tured her as poor, hunted, oppressed per haps. 'The lady who answers perfectly to your description, and is the counterpart of the picture, I saw in an opera-box, dressed in satin, loaded with diamonds, surrounded by a gay party of friends. I think, you will do well to 'come on. for although I could not trace her home. I hope,- through some mem ber, of the party with which I saw her, to find out everything you may wish to know, More it would be unwise to write, but under the changed circumstances, I am yours to command. JLuis Moses.' Having listened to- the reading of this, Carnes once again volunteered an opinion of Mr. Moses. 'That Jew has almost showed his hand. He's a sheeny, and he scents a fat 'settler'; from somebody. You'll have to go, Dick, but look out for Sheeny Moses.' Stanhope laughed. 'I'm greatly obliged to Sheeny Moses, if he puts me upon any thing like the ghost of a track; I won't ask him to strain his tender conscience once he puts me upon the trace of my lady. Don't be too hard upon the fellow. Rufe; these 'literary consciences' are tender things.' (To be continued.)
