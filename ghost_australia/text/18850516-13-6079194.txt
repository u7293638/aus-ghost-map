LONDON TOWN TALK. (TnOM Olllt CoUIlLSrOND-NT ) LONDON, At mi, 3. The case 01 Sampson t Dou, with its re- sult, has caused great alarm among the dramatic critics, they declare that they will now be afraid to open their mouths I do not presume to decide the merits of so delicate a case, it is certainly not " good natured to say that an admittedly clever actor, suffering from partial paralysis, makes capital out of his disease and presents a painful spectacle to all beholders I don't believe in the least that "a sense of public duty moved the critic to so express himself, and I am never sorry to see ill natured people punished. Sf ill, when I remember what my unfortunate brethren of the men have to suffer habitually from the- critics, the promptness with which the law has stepped in to defend this poor Dove from his power his antagonist surprises me in the very same newspaper in which the report of this trial with its tOO damages, appears, an author, and a member, as it would seem, of many learned societies applies for a summons for libel against a critic who in reviewing his book inquires " whether even a score of initials clapped after a man's name justifies him in writing trash The application is dismissed by the magistrate as absurd, and he even adds a bit of contemptuous advice-" The comments will do you no harm, my good sir on the contrary, will help to advertise you This may be very true, but does anyone want an advertisement of that nature ' What no doubt caused the magistrate to pooh pooh the case was its exceptional character Painters and actors are always whining in our courts of law, like school-boys to their master, about the conduct of this or that billy critic whereas authors even that irritable genus the poets, let the rev lewers say just what they like of them, and never dream of apply- ing for similar redress A story is going the round of the Anglo Indian press respecting the Ameer of Afghanistan, which is described by the London papers as incredible It is to the effect that the Ameersuflers from toothache, and desires the assistance of a celebrated dentist in Upper India, but that our officials will not permit that gentleman to go to Cabul I see nothing incredible in this at all I would certainly not permit my dentist -if there was no other, as in this case, within DOO miles to go to any such place li the Ameer suffers what J suffer he would come himself to Upper or even Lower India and have it out Cabul is not a good place for an) European and certainly not for one be valuable to his fellow countrymen as an ox tractor of molars It he was unsuccessful with the Ameer or gave him pain, he would probably be put to death to slow music, and Athan music. I can fancy no better lesson for an Eastern potentate to learn than he is being taught at this moment Let him make his capital sale and agreeable and I have no doubt that not only dentists but chiropodists also (though, from the circumstances of the inhabitants wearing no shoes, Afghanistan is not a corn growing country will very readily grace it with their presence It has been calculated by a Parisian play goes that a first night audience consisting of a thousand persons is made up of the following component parts - Personal enemies of the author 60 1er tins who without knowing him, hope fora failure 103 TltobO who have paid an extravagant price for their seats and are therefore ill disposed to him 123 Persons who are cross from a bad dinner 14 I persons who are generally cross Women deserted by the author at one time of his life or another Fellow authors Those to whom the author has refused to lend money Enemies of the manager indifferent . lends Halting population In BhaL House the funeral of Mr Tnlkinghorn is described with great humour The aristocracy send their empty carriages with" bereaved worms,' six foot high, hanging on to them in the shape of footmen To judge by the accounts of the burial of the late Prince Lan Va, the Chinese outdo us in their pompous mockeries of woe The procession of His Royal Highness's remains was preceded by a huge wooden cage, represent- ing his soul Then followed his sportsmen, leading 210 hounds, then his arm chair, then soldiers and servants by the hundred and at last the Emperor, represented by six empty carriages I In the Army and Navy Stores Circular there is a charming advertisement Two ladies, one of whom has had great success in the artificial hatching and rearing of chickens, wish to meet with a retired officer to join them either as a boarder or in the management of the poultry . Large tennis and other laws good cooking, It There is surely) more in this than meets the eye W h) should this chicken reader want a military man, who ought to have no chicken heart to help her ' I am afraid that she is no chicken The ancient sport of hawking has been re- lived on Salisbury) Plain I am old enough to remember when it was carried on in Berk- shire on that portion of the Haley Downs which has since been so much used as a training ground for racehorses Any thing more picturesque than the hawks with their bells and presses, on the frame work carried by the falconer, is not to be imagined , the eager stare of the noble birds when their un covered eyes are roving the say for an object of pursuit, their swiftness of flight when the) perceive it, and their docility in returning to the " lure, form a charming spectacle It is however, a dangerous amusement, because the sportsmen, as they rule, must necessarily keep their eyes in the air, and many a tumble over the ruts and roads have I seen in consequence As the hero was not to he found on the down as the humble rock had to take its place and instead of the lure which in heraldry is described as two wings joined with a line to the end of which is attached a ring the falconer used a dead pigeon On the table of every club of any political pretensions in London there is now lying for signature the Address of Thanks to our colonial brethren for the prompt and voluntary offer of their assistance to the mother country It will include in it all the w offices of England No one indeed, who understands the immense significance which that offer involves, and even its probable influence on the future of civilisation, will abstain from signing No idea of creed, or party, or form of government will interfere with that At the same time regret has been expressed in many quarters at the style in which the address is couched We are all loyal subjects of the Queen but it is not as " subjects of the Queen, but as 1 Englishmen, and their kith and kin, that we stretch forth our hands to these brethren across the see with affection and gratitude ' 1 Englishmen I believe was the word originally proposed, but the matter fell, as such matters are only too prone to fall into courtier hands, which moulded it into its present and less presentable shape It is strange among the numerous and heterogeneous followers of the Court there is no one except the Poet Laureate who knows how to express its ideas with good taste It seems to know no style between the frigidity of Imperial etiquette and the "gush ' of a housemaid I came upon a charming example of "gush the other day in one of the last places one would dream of looking for it, the Pt<6 Ushers Circular It was a sort of elegy, though, alas I only in prose, upon the late Colonel Burnaby That he was a very brave soldier, and could w held his pen almost as well as his sword, every one knows, though the attempt made on more than one occasion, for party purposes, to rank him with Gordon, or even Stewart, is ridiculous One would certainly never have selected him for tbesubjectof an epic The recollection of his greatness has, however almost led his pub fisher nita Bong The idea of a publisher Bing ing the praise of one of his own authors is of itself unparalleled , nothing could be more amazing, except, indeed, the idea of an author hymning a publisher 'The naivete of this eulogistic most remarkable. He (the colonel) was somewhat fidgetty about his proof sheets, if none came for a short to terval, he would write Two (days, and I have received nothing this makes me swear puts my liver out of order, and does away with the effect of the water. (What waters ' Purely not strong waters' If they were any other kind of waters the opportunity for an advertisement has been missed indeed.) ' on are probably right about the repetition I write as I talk, and I do not pretend to have any style, but I have let two or three people look at the proof, not connected with the press, but average mortals J call them out Foolovietos J Iilj like the book, and I think they form the majority of the reading public, (are two or three personal friends who have an jo) ed the opportunity of seeing the colonels proof sheets must be charme 1 at this One is glad however, to find that if somewhat severe upon his intimates he could also be what is technically termed stiff with those judges of style, his publishers themselve. ) Never would he admit the possibility of failure in an) literary venture be undertook and therefore always entailed upon hundreds pall beforehand (The above april as one as a touch of real feeling A chord of memory connected with cash down is still vibrating, ) The last letter received from him contains the following characteristic remark - Lola on I mean to make one more I ii rai d three II Moi once to 1 miracles when I will write ) on a book such a book ' kind will be nothing to it that will make your fortune Alas observes the publisher deeply moved how gladly would we (the firm ') have sacrificed the chance of making a fortune to have seen his fine handsome face and beard his genial laugh once a un Even it speaking for himself this impassioned writer h sa) ing a good deal but if he is speaking for self and partner-well really one can only put it down to some effect of the waters I One needn't go in these days to Timbuctoo to have experiences which in former times were denied to those who did not explore the wildest regions The following adventure, which happened to a peaceful Lincolnshire farmer the other day might occur to you reader or to me to morrow yet none can say it was not stupendous and amazing At 7 o'clock in the morning while driving in a gig from our market town to another he meets an elephant quite unattended The road was soft and the elephant took up stones and earth in his train which he playfully) threw at him This was itself a tune which neither the farmer nor his horse at all appreciated but as the gigantic animal near a them its behaviour became even more peculiar Instead of keeping its own side as a sagacious elephant should have done it crossed the road and stood immediately) before the Nellie horse, " not being accustomed to elephants was greatly alarmed, bolted, and overturned the gig and its occu punt, break in the latters ankle There upon the animal, so far from apologising for what had occurred, straddled over him, cut glass from the hedge and barley from the held, and to show his contempt "spat the same in his face For all which injuries and insults, the farmer has naturally de round. 1 and obtained damages from the proprietor of the elephant, who was connected (but unfortunately not by a rope with a travelling caravan. One can fancy) the honest farmer retailing this experience to his children s children, fortunate in their comment when asked what is the explanation of the phenomenon is not the same as that passed by Walter Scott upon his ancient relations ghost star) ' Aiblms our grandfather is a keen Incidents of an abnormal and exceptional kind now occur in this country, independent of elephants In Limerick last week an individual having publicly announced his intention of taking the life of his mother and another, as he expressed it (as though it were a dividend warrant received through a trustee), was arrested by the police. He had but one leg and one eye but he had made his preparations for them. They found him in a posture of defence, the stump of his amputated leg being placed on the bed so as to steady himself, with a razor in each hand The position he deemed impregnable and announced his intention to kill all comers The police, four of them assisted by several civilians holding the door par itally open endeavoured with long sticks to his inn him and at length made a rush at him with anything but satisfactory results The position was carried but with severe loss , its gallant defender is now in hospital with his assailants I would respectfully recommend this case to the consideration of those ten try who alwayS associate heroism with an obstinate defence of life If it had been somebody else is life which this gentlemen had been defending, he might, indeed have ranked with General Gordon, but considering his antecedents and relatives-his mother, for example, whom he had intended to murder-I, For my part, should have admired him more if he had not given so much trouble Nothing can be more characteristic than the news of the Lincolnshire Handicap being telegraphed to the zareba in the desert, it in a manner expresses the whole national diameter in a nutshell How very, very strange it would seem to foreigners, it they could ever get to understand what a Lincolnshire Handicap is
