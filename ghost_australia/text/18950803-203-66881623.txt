BULLA. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Thursday. Intensely cold weather still prevails in this district. A biting northerly wind has been blowing all the week, with oc- casional showers. The crops have a very backward appearance, and most of the farmers have had to sow over a second time. A great many people round here are complaining of the severe loss they have sustained of late in losing several of their cows owing to the scarcity of feed. The animals are so weak that they fall down and are unable to rise again. The marriage of Miss O'Brien, of Holden, and Mr Cleary, of .Melbourne, is announced to take place at a very early date. The Broadmeadows footballers journey to Bulla on Saturday to try conclusions with our boys. Bulla is very dormant just at present. The advent of the Tantanoola tiger, or a real live suburban ghost, would be ac- ceptable.
