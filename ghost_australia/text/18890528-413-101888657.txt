M. Crespin professed to hare almost unlimited' powers in curing tho ills to which man and! boaat aro heir, and eo groat was the oonfidenoei hoinspirod that ho had consulting rooms iu most of tho towns in tho department, attending, moreover, at all the fairs, to which ho was driven in his own oarriage and pain On an unlucky day for him, however, it / chanced that a certain wealthy peasant came in conault him about the illness of a pig. Tho animal, according to tho quaok, was possessed of the devil, nnd to remedy mattera the peasant was told ho must pay a certain nam of money to have masses celebrated^ This the credulous client did, nnd the pf|£ getting no better, n matter of another 400f^ went from its owner's pocket into the ehar~ lutan's hands. Still the grunter remained i» n\\\ s\latraing state of health, and at length it ijiive up tho ghost. Tho peasant* exasperate# at tho loss of the pig, and at tho loss of his« money as well, lodged n comprint with the police, in consequence of which M. Louis Crespin has boon arrested on tho chargo of nwindIiogv For some time to come, there fore, ho will probable be unable to ride about iu his carriago and four.
