I Ana i thought of my former thinking § 01 the judgment day to be, I But sitting alone with my oonsolenoe I Seemed judgment enough for mc. I Ana I wondered if there was a future ' To this land beyond the grave; S But no one gave mc an answer, ?? And no one came to save. " Then I felt that the future was present, ' And tha present would never go by, 'i For it was but the thought ot my past life | Grown into eternity. ?' Then I woke from my timely dreaming, ' And tho vision passed awoy, 1 Aod I knew the far-away warning I Had a warning ot yesterday— ! And I pray I may not forget ft In this land before the grave, That I may not ory in the future And no one oome to save. And bo I have learned a lesson Wbioh I ought to have known before, And whiob, though I learned in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my oonsolenoe, In tbeplaca where the years inoreass, And I try to remember the future Id the land where time will cease. And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it be, That to sit alone with my oonsolenoe Will bo judgment enough for mc.
