MR. PARGITER, THE GHOST. When I first knew Gwendoline Gilbert I veiyne&rlyfell; inlove witb her. At lint Yaffi l bad * 'pencbsnt for healthy looting girls ; and* being yonng, I was an ardkit admirer of the British blonde. Gwendoline Gilbert wm Hygeis herself; JSuuna, Lidy Hamilton, when she was in/the service of Doctor Graham, the ' <pmrsk, cooldnot baye looked the part moce'thon^L^lythandid Gwendoline. Boir' I/sdored that girl! At that time, yon know, Mr Burne-Jones hadn't invented theyoung lady with the tonsly hair, the ^ungainly attitudes, the green complexion and the prehensile toes ; so v -it was quite permissible to admire a girl : who looked like the goddess of health. She was a parson's daughter; she hadn't a penny in the world, Sir John! Tomlmgon wiS the member for Ratcliff Highway, and had made pots of money by the adulteration of the poor man's smbhI rheg his pardon, I take that hack—I mean by his improvements in! the ait of producing malt liqnbr of a superior description. He came, he saw, he conqnered; of conrse he did. They Wgn married, they, started on riieir honeymoon, and I went to Heme Bay jor a fortnight in a huff, and wrote my celebrated monograph on ,:Sonr \- Ctaapes." . Lady Tomlinson was nice, beantiful, and.aawc all know, as good as gold. ^ inclined to en 4jtmi^ B6<ieiy plulanderer8; and from what those gentlemen called her * stand ■ off,J any, and from a certain disinclina tion toward .gossip' and scandal and theatricals and ;innsic h&Usj; She got the reputation of being rather htnpid. At any rate, in c^^:«f:'her.;hee«ity and her husband's millions, Gwendoline ms not altogether husbands, as brutal persons; they of not mincing j|pSBMfcttirt ,mlii theirwives, and of calling a spade a spade. ,y ' ''Look hfire, Lady Tomlinson," said s^sHir John—he always called her Lady Tomlmsdn—" yon don't shine in society; tfyou'ranofc a dancing woman, nor a talk 1- ii^ womanv rior a political woman, and you 'ain't, iittery. i wish to heaven #vyouM,d^ sort of individuality of jour own, Lady Tomlinson." Lady Tomlinson retired instantly to . her bondoir.and had a good cry. For :' three whole days did Lady Tomlinson brood and meditate, and then she sent for Mr Pargiter, the painter.

She took the brash from Mr Pargiter s hand, and in great sprawling letters she wrote in the right-hand corner of the picture,." Owen. Tomlinson." " Madam." said Mr Pargiter, with a low bow, when she had finished, " you're a genius." And then she placed an envelope in the artist's hand. •'I can trust you, Mr Pargiter?'* she said, in those soft purring tones Of hers. Mr Pargiter laid his hand npon his heart, gave Lady Tomlinson what looked very like a wink, and assured her, in solemn tones, that she could. Two days afterward Lady Tomlinson was " At Some." I was there; I am an art critic by profession, yon know. On a green plush easel, draped by a heavy curtain of green plnsh, stood the rustic head in an eight-inch gilt frame, r don't know what the head was worth, bat the frame was cheap at a five-pound note. '< What do yon think of it," Mr Scorcher, bleated that innocent lamb, Lady Tomlinson, to me. " l*#e jost got it home from my frame-maker's, and it's the first of my efforts that I've had the hardihood to show to my friends." I compared it to Stonae. I said it reminded me of Madame Vigee le Bran, and various other artists. Next spring they hang itat Burlington House; they hong that tworgninea Pargiter, and we i all went into ecstasies at the private I view. Bat the measure of Lady Tomlinson's; iniquity was not yet full. She palled^ down the wall papers from her boudoir,. and she decorated the walls of that' apartment with an extraordinary compo sition of tress, flowers, sunsets,. wheat sheaves, and good-looking children and., girls, under the superintendence of the villain Pargiter. Half London went to see it " - Sir John Tomlinson is justly proud of his wife. She isan artistic light now. She has only to take a young artist by the hand and his fortune's made., , " I'm very fond of Lady Tomlinson," said Mr Pargiter to me the ether day ; " she throws a good deal of work in my way."
