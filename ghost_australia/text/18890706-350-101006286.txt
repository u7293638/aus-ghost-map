IBoveUst. The Ghost of Oak Crag. DV ESTHEtt SEltLE KENNETH. The old Meadows house. Everyone in Lennox knew where it wns. For y<nrs only part of it wus occupied. The build ing stood upon what was called "Oak Crag," and rose, a great solemn stone building, nearly square, in the full sight of the town. Once it had been a very popular place, rb the country seat of the Meadows. Parties from the city thronged it all summer. It was known as a popular re Bort while old Drake Meudows lived. But for years it bad been nearly de sorted, and most of the family were dead. The family had rapidly died out. Old Drake Meadows lost his wife and daugh ter, then parted with this life himself, leaving the property to two sons-one of whom, very wealthy, resided in Europe ; the other-well, nobody knew exactly where Rick Meadows was or what had become of him. He used to be known in the old times as the scapegrace son, who was always in difficulty. He bad a kind of passionate pride, but no dignity. He was hail fellow well met with everybody, and used to go fishing with the tavern boys, and off on night expeditions after nobody knew what. A great trial to his rather tiffy proud relations, the towns people assorted ; but with them he was a great favorite. In spite of his pranks upon their per sons and property, there were generous ways and winning tricks about the boy. He would sometimes atone in the most lavish manner for his depredations upon their possessions-bringing back the fruit or chickens or pumpkins he had stolen at night, or if the property was destroyed, more than paying for it out of his pocket money '* When angered or insulted, he would fight like a young demou, and drive everything before him. In his per sonal likings ho was quite as fervid, and "to love and hate like Rick Meadows" had bccome a proverb in the town. But when the family left the Crag, one nutumn, and never came back agaio, Rick disappeared from their view. He wus a lad of eighteen then ; ana, not long aftep news of his father's death came, it was reported that he had gone into the army. For years and years the house stood empty, The garden run to waste, the fences grew dilapidated, and the trees seemed to sigh in a mournful way before the silent door, w hen one day a mess an ger arrived from the pity to say that Ed ward Mi'ndows, the owner, wanted to put an occupant in it who would keep the plaoe in order for the rent. The news seemed a perfect godsend to Emma Lamar. She never thought for a moment thit the house was haunted ; for the place, like any other deserted habitation, had gathered disagreeable re ports. She only knew that it would be a home for her brother Westerly and herself during Westerly's studies; and sheaccordingly applied for it and obtained it. The brother and sister were very different. Dearlv as Emma Lamar loved her brother Westerly Lamar was a bad, passionate, unscrupulous fellow. He had inherited choleric blood and a lelfish nature from his father. All his mother's noble qualities seemed trans mitted' to his sister. Emma was the elder, being twenty-three. Westerly wa8 just of age. Resolute facing of a hard world had liven Emma Lamar an air that was a little grim ; but she had exquisite fea tures and beautiful, dark-blue eyes. She tfould have been a beauty and a belle if .he had possessed the tastes and manners or a beauty and a belle ; but life was and always had been 4 serioUB matter with her. _ She had seen father and mother die in her early youth; and now she lived for Westerly, who was not a very comforting object to live for. Westerly was studying medicine, and was, at least, an ambitious student. Of course ^ they were poor, but Emma's capability kept them always in respect able appearance. She kept them also perfectly independent and out of dobt, which gave them a strong claim to the re spect of their neighbors. When they went to Oak Crag to live, they had everybody's best wishes. No one was particularly fond of Westerly Lamar, but all wished him well for his sister's sake. Everyone approved of Emma Lamar, the devoted daughter and good sister. The first evening they spont at Oak Crag, both felt a little strangely. They occupied the west Bide. The remainder of the house was deathly still. That morning they had wandered through it, viewing for the first time the spacious rooms, half stripped of their furnishings, murky and dusty, and smellihg of mould. The place was merely a curiosity to them then ; but when darkness closed over it, and they remembered what a changed place it was since the days when the grand old place had been their childhood's awe and admiration, the neighborhood of those cold and desolate rooms to their evening fire wajj, a littlo opprea " This is a pokerish place, after all, Em," said Westerly, after he had sat silent a while, listening to the moaning oÂ£ the wind in the ohimney, while his sister Emma sat by the hearth, absorbed in her work. She looked up. " But it is going to be so much better for us, -Westerly. " It will take all my time to look after that old garden." "Not more time than you ought to give to exercise after studyiug so much." " But I want to 'go into the city some times." And Westerly Lamar rose, strolled to the window, and looked thoughtfully out at the pitch-black night. His sister was silent for a moment,than she said; "You mustn'l go into the city and leave me alotie here, Westerly." "I'd never have come here if I had thought of that," exclaimed Westerly Lamar, impatiently. " What were vou thinking of whenyou made the plan, Em? Did you wane to bury us alive ?" " We oan't afford to be vt rv sav. "Westerly." - 7 S " Afford ! I'll afford a decent lifts on? of these days," muttered the young man, as he turned again to the window, and looked at the city lights. There was a look of peculiar concern upon his sister's face ns she went on with her work. She might have been hurt by her brother's ingratitude, or perhaps sh'e was thinking her plan of coming to Oak" Crag might be an unfortunate one. Her expression was very grave, whatever rnicht be its cause. Westetly finally returnod from the window to his bookn. As the moments passed, and the clock ticked loud I v in the silent room, Emma's head bent lower and lower over her sewing, and at last a tear splashed on the snowy linen. She had tried so hard to make the place pleasant and homelike to Westerly I At least it did seem that he was unappreciative. He looked up at her suddenly as 'the clock struck ten. .* Em, you had better go to bed. I am going to study till late," lie said. Emma hesitated. "I'm not sleepy. Won't you be lonely ! here, Westerly ? ! " No," he replied. " I can study much better by myself." So, after a little while, Emma put by her work, bade him good-night, and went across the hall to her room. 1 She sighed heavily bb she let down her hair before the mirror; and, as she looked ' at the reflection of her face, she saw that her cheek was pale, and her eyes mourn ful and steadfast. j She went to bed, but did not sleep. She watched the moonlight creep across the floor, and listened to the dismal wail ing of the wind, until the clock struck | twelve. Then ehe rose, wrapped herself from the frosty air, <jjnd stepped aoroes the hall. She opened the sitting room dopr softly and looked in. The oil had burned out of the lamp, and the wick sputtered feebly. The room was unoccupied, and apparently had beeh for some time, for the fire was out, and the atmosphere was ohilly. Emma Lamar went back to her bed and burying her faoe in the pillows', sobbed like a child. She realised her dreadful situation. Probably she would be left alone in that desolate place night alter night, while her brother was away Heaven only knew where. She had her secret. For the last three months her brother had been accustomed secretly to take the night train at eleven o'clook, go into the city, and return to his room at somewhere about foilr o'clock in the morning. She possessed this kuowledge unknown to him. When he would make his appearance at breakfast, it would bo with pale cheeks and bloodshot eyes, or sullen and heavy headed with insufficient sleep. With a dread that was almost a surety of evil, she had asked no questions. She believed her brother to bo wedded to some bad practice, but she could not tell what. He was easily angered, and she did not dare question him for fear of causing an outbreak which would be no satisfaction. So, after moat earnest thought, she had come to Oak Crag, hoping that the change of situation and the demand upon his time and attention might alter his habits. She was con vinced that the plan was unsuccessful 5 and the prospuct of being left alone in that gloomy place night after night wa3 appalling. The clock struck one. Just then a slight noise startled her. She raised her head and listened. It was a step in the room above. Her heart stood still, and then commenced beating so that she was nearly suffocated. Her first thought was to lock the door of her room, She did this, and then crept back into bed and listened. She could distinctly hear some one going about over head, and for a while she was completely abandoned to terror. Then she attempted some solution of the problem. The house was old, and the noise might be caused by rats. But she could not, in reason, entertain this idea more than a minute. The step became a regular pacing over head. She was convinced that some one beside herself was in the house. She lay and listened to the sound. Then she thought it might be Westerly ; but she knew too well that her brother abhorred those lonely precincts overhead, and would by no moans enter them by night. He was miles away, and she was alone in what seemed to her great danger. The suite of rooms that the Lauiarshad taken were on the ground floor. Emma's bedroom window was about three feet from the garden walk. Through the oak boughs the moonlight flickered on the floor, and she lay looking at it as she listened. Suddenly the sound overhead ceased. Wondering what this might portend, she listened anxiously; and fearing, possibly, some assault, she re membered that her bodroom window was not fastened, and the room was of easy access from the ground. Springing up, ahe was about to slip from the bed and fasten it, when a shadow fell across the floor in the patch of flickering moonlight. She glanced toward the window, and saw a face-a droadful, wild, ghastly, pallid face-with burning eyeathat mothers for a moment; then the face disappeared, and Emma Lamar sank back in a swoon of terror. Whon she returned to consciousness, ahe heard her brother cough in his room adjoining ; and she knew that he had re turned, and it must be nearly morning. With a feeling of safety, Bhe turned upon her pillow, and, resolving to investigate the mystery as day came, fell asleep. It waB late when she awoke, and she sprang from bed before she remembered the events of the night. It seemed like a dream as she suddenly remembered what the last night's experience had been ; and the more so when she threw open the windows and let in the ringing songs of the birds. At breakfast she told Westerly the Btory. He came out of his room sleepy and sullen ; but when she commenced her narrative he flashed into sudden anger. "1 tell you the cursed old place is haunted, Em," he exclaimcd. " Of course it is. There's no other solution for such sights and sounds. I presume old Meadow's ghost haunts it; and unless you want such visitors every night we hud better leave.'' - " If I thought it nothing more real than ghosts, and you were here, Westerly, I should not be afraid," replied his siater. " What do you mean by my being hove 1" ho said quickly. '. You were not here last night, Wes terly," answered Emmn, hardly willing to meet his glance of astonishment and anger at her discovery, yet speaking firmly. Westerly was silent a moment, then said with cool bravado, " I had business in the city. And I'll tell j'ou what, Em, I may be away any night. So, if you don't want to be lel't alone here with the ghosts, you'd better find some other abode. For my part, .1 nover was iu favor of coming her." " Why, what can you want in the city at night, Westerly ?" said Etnina, sorrow fully. '.That's my business," roplied Westerly, gruffly, bonding over his breakfast. Here the cmveiviuion dropped, for Emma felt too deeply for words, and Westerly ate his breakfast in silence. During the forenoon they went about thoir separate occupations j bui in the afternoon Emma came into the Bit ting-room where her brother sat studying, and laying her hand lightly upon his arm, asked, "Westerly, will you go up stairs with me ?" , " What for he asked in surprise. " To see if any one is there, or has been there," she said. For a moment he looked incredulous. Then he rose Blowly, saying, " Why, Em, you must be a fool I How could any one get into those rooms ? They are looked in every direction. But I'll go up if you like." They went up-stairs. The stairs were broad and the steps low. The halls, dusty and sunny, eohoed their voices when they spoke ; but, though lonely, the place was not in any degree fearful. They unlocked and opened room after room, all of which looked silent and un disturbed. At last they came to the chamber from whence had proceeded the sound of footsteps the previous night. Emma Lamnr's heart beat hard as she un locked the door. They entered. The room was silent, and eohoed the creaking door. All was perfectly still and undis turbsd. Westerly laughed as hia sister looked about the room. " Do you suppose ghosts leave any marks to traok them by?" said he. " Oomo, Em, don't be silly any longer. I tell you no live person could have been ' in the room last night." " What is this ?" Emma picked up a glove from the floor. Both examined it in surprise. It was a man's buckskin glove, gauntleted, and fastened with a heavy gold button, on which were engraved the initials, " R.M." The glove bore the impress of a shapely hand ; but it was impossible to tell how recently it had been worn, ifc was so soiled and stained. "Ithas probably lain here for years, where some visitor of the old family dropped it," remarked Westerly. "I fancy it feels slightly damp, Wes i terly," said his sister. "NonsenseI It's nothing but the dampness of the room. These north-west chambers are full of chills. Oome, throw it down, and let us go down stairs." But Emma kept the glove, carried it down stairs, and laid it away. That night Westerly promised her that he would not leave the house, and the brother and sister retired to their rooms at ten o'clock. Suddenly, as the clock struck eleven a bell rang violently through the house It was nob the hall door bell, but proceeded from one of the chambers. Emma heard her brother spring out of bed with an oath. The next moment he was at her door when she met him. ' "For heaven's sake what is that, Emma ?' he exclaimed. " It is the bell of the north-west cham ber, Bhe replied. All this time the bell was ringing. Sud denly it Btopped. " What shall we do, Westerly 1" " Curse me if I don't find out what this means I exclaimed her, brother. He sprang back to his room, and, to Emma's surprise, returned with a revol ver. " Where did you get that, Westerly ?" "Never mind. Take that light and come with me." She was dresaed only in slippers and wrapper, and the air of the entries was chill; but she did not mind. She fol lowed her brother in his rapid speed up stairs. Strange to say, his theory of ghosts had never made any impression on her. She feared nothing so vague but anticipated some strange discovery of human beings where all had seemed deso lation. The first strange development was tlmfc the door of the north-west chamber was unlocked. It yielded to Westerly s hand, and with an exclamation of surprise l>e entered. , , There was no doubt that it was occu pied. A faint light glimmered on the table, and upon a lounge lay a man, evi dently in the agonies of death. His face was deadly pale, and the eyes were rolled up as if he wore in convulsions. The brother and sister stood by in silent hor ror. In a moment the convulsed fea tures were seen to relax, and the breath stopped. Â« " Ho is dead," raid Westerly. They brought the light to the marble f ice. It wÂ»s handsome and haggard. Westerly uttered an exclamation of sur prise. " What is it, Westerly ?" . " I saw that man last night in the city." "Where?" "In a gambling saloon,' replied the young man, excitedly. He forgot at the moment that he was betraying himself. Indeed, Emma La mar was too agitated to notice the betrayal beyond the mere words. She looked down at the man, and a look of weariness and sorrow on the still, pallid face touched her to tears. , . , , "Pshaw 1 What are you crying for i1 exclaiincd Westerly., " Hold the light a minute," He gave her the light, then, unfasten ing the man's necktie, and, baring his breust, mude various tests of life. The form lay as impassive and cold as marble. " He's dead enough," said Westerly. " What'are we to do with him 1 Shall I call a physician, Westerly ? I am no afraid to go down thcthill." Emma Lamar thought she would prefer it to remaining with tiiat solemn dead figure, while her brother went to call hi-lp or evidence. But Westerly did not answer. After a few moments he covered the face, and said, Come down Btairs now." _ Tiiey went buck to the sitting room, pub down tho light, and looked at each other. * " How-did he come here, Westerly r "Heaven only knows; but, Em, it's the best luck that; ever happened to me ?" " How ?" " I shall uso him for a subject if noth ing happens to prevent-that is, if I see no chance of detection. Prof. Gardner will/pay me one hundred pound ., and ask no questions." " Good heavens 1 Westerly, I beg of you-" "Pshaw! Hush, will you 1 Theres nothing to prevent. I've mado up my mind. And there's the body-a spleudid case. You noticed his dress, did you not?" "No." "Army-major's outfit, I think. He's a foreigner; I noticed his accent last night. He won my monoy like the devil. How he happened to be in this house is the mystery." " What killed him " Late hours and liquor, perhaps. Pos-i sibly ho took a quiet dose of something to get himself out of the hands of the law. He was a desperate looking fellow when there was life in his face." " Oh, Westerly, where have you learned about these things ? You have changed bo much in a year 1" ?'Go to bed, Em ; don't preach 1" " What are you going to do ?" " I am going up-stairs again." " Westerly, I pray you do nothing with that man's body to-night." " I'll do what I please, Em. You had bettor go to bed." "But, Westerly, the danger of-" " I will manage my affairs. Go to bed." He took another light and went to his room. His sister knew that he had gone for his surgical case. Trembling with cold and excitement, and trying vainly to collect her faculties that she might think calmly, she retreated to her room, and lay down, half sick with the workings of fear and anxiety. She heard her brothergo up. stairs. The thought of hiB work made her faint. She prayed that something might happen to prevent. Just then she heard him returning. " Westerly 1" she called. He canie to tho door. "Listen to me a moment, Westerly. Suppose that man should be tracked here, and found mutilated, what is to Bave you from the accusation of mur der ?" " No fear of that. The family burying ground of the Meadows will have one more occupant before morning. I shall have quite done with him in an hour." '' Oh, Westerley, you don't realise what a desperate thing you are doing 1" "Don't 11 A hundred pounds is worth a little desperation. Go to sleep, sis." He shut the door and wont up-stairs. Emma buried her face in tho pillow, and wept in an agony of despair. Not only was her brother's work revolting to her, ' but she realised how imminent was the peril. Westerly seemed determined to bring certain destruction upon them. But suddenly she heard him come leaping down the stairs. He burst into her room.' " He has gone I" "Gone?" " Yes. I believe he. was the devil. How could he take himaelt off when he was dead?" And Westerly Lamar, a moment before so cool, leaned against the door, and wiped the perspiration of excitement from his forehead. " How did he go, Westerly?" " I don't know. I made a slight cut in the breast, and then came down for my other instruments. When I went buck he was gone." " Were the windows and doors open ?" "The door was ajar just as 1 left it. The windows were shut." " Westerly, I um so glad 1" " Of what ?" That you did him no harm." "Eooll" exclnimed Westerly in a sud den rage. " What harm could I possibly do the mnn if he were dead ?" " Bathe wasn't dead." " 1 tell you he was as dead as a post!" Westerly went back to the sitting room. It was nearly daybreak, and ho made a fire. He sat over it moodily when Etcnna came out. Then ho rose suddenly, and went up-Btairs. In a few moments he came down with something in his hand. " What it that, Westerly ?" " 2s utliing- but that glove," ho said, as ho it down. " lint I put that glove away. This must uo the mate." It was so. Tho buttons bore tho same initials. Emma took thorn ii charge as a cluo to the stranga opisodo of tho night. That day it was decided that they should leave the house. It bore a horror to Einma Lamar ; and, since her plan in coming there was not likely.to prove suc cessful, it was not worth while to romain in so disagreeable a place. They would go back to tho little cottage they had rented for the Inst tlireo years, and live as best they might. At least she would be near to neighbors thore when left alone at night. She had never before in her life been so unhappy, and she could nob keep back her tears as sh'i prepared for their re moval. Beside lier disappointment and sorrow, she was wearied and nervous from the effects of the night's excitement, and at last, during her brother's absence, she dung herself down upon her bed and cried like, a child. The poor girl felfc tired be yond her strength. At twilight she arose and went into the garden, hoping that her aching head would be relieved by the clear, frosty air. Besides she could not bin acknowledge to herself a dislike to stay in the house alone. Westerly had promised ro return at six o'clock, and she stood on the hill watching the road, when she saw u dark spot upon the gravel walk at her feot. A second glance assured her that it was blood, and her heart leaped up in horror. Gazing in a kind of fascination at the ground, she saw another and another dull red spot, and still drops beyond. Stop ping forward she followed the murks to a little summer-house in an oak coppice, and there upon the sent lay extended the figure of a man. (Concluded in our next.)
