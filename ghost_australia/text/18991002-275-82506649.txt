THE HAUNTED HOUSE. ______o______ A curious story is told by a correspon- dent of the "Liverpool Post" of a haunt- ed house at Southport. It was occupied by an independent lady possessed of a decidedly masculine type of mind and iron nerve. While occupied one fore- noon at her writing-desk, this lady, hav- ing, according to her own story, a feel- ing that someone was in the room, look- ed up, and saw standing at the other side of the desk a figure of a woman who was gazing intently at her. The figure had its head covered with a dark- colored mantle, though the features were distinctly shown. The lady, not believ ing in ghosts, and convinced that she was under an hallucination, put out her hand to touch the apparition. She, of course, touched nothing but air. The figure, however, remained for a few minutes, and then retreated towards the door, and vanished. This experience was repeated on at least three occasions, and the lady kept it secret for fear of creating alarm. However, one day, again in the forenoon, a piercing shriek was heard from the kitchen, and one of the servants was found lying in a fit. She averred that an exactly similar ap- parition had passed through the kitchen a few minutes /before. The apparition was seen once afterwards by a third per- son, but did not subsequently recur. _______________ Mexico has had 55 Presidents since 1621\. Of these 16 have died violent deaths.
