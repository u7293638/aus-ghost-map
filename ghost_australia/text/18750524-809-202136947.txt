THE SMYTHESDALR GHOST. to the editor of the agk. Sir, — In answer to your Smytbesdalo corre spondent on tho supposed hobgoblin mystery, will you permit me to remark that while spiritists believe, nay know, that spirits can materialise and show themselves, thov can onlv do so under certain conditions, wliich conditions, in tbo case related, are entirely wanting. Would it not be more likely that some ono is amusing himself with a magic lantern ? — Yours, Ac., IRIS.
