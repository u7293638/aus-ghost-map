LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Dec. 29. D, QTim'hatce's Secret is, it seems, the name of the half finished never left behind him by Nathaniel Hawthorne. If there really is a secret (though I cannot say Hawthorne had the power of putting any reader upon tenterhooks in that way), let us hope enough has been written for it to be guessed at, It was an additional matter for regret in the case of Edwin Drood that it was useless No one aces, though many have pretended to see, the key of the enigma If novelists would only take the trouble to write out the rough sketch of their plot before setting to work upon the story, this posthumous inconvenience would be averted. If a popular writer were malignant he might indeed construct half a novel to leave behind him, and realise something handsome for his family, without any plot at all, but which might seem to be full of plot hints that had in reality no meaning, and passages that' very literally "led to nothing and thereby amuse a whole generation with speculations and surmises. There seems to be a great deal of false information about concerning Anthony Trol hoped circumstances As I stood on the Steps of the Kensal Green Chapel waiting for the long procession that accom 'panted his body to the tomb, I overheard two labouring men in talk about him " This is Trollope s funeral,' said one " And who was Trollope' Oh, I know, be sure, he was a sculptor (I think this arose out of some marvellous confusion with Messrs. Trollope, the builders ) ' No, no, he was a storyteller, bless you returned No 1 " he made a hundred thousand pounds by his pen (This Billy tale had been told, I afterwards learnt, in one of the daily papers ) " Lawka, but that a a deal of money " Vea, it happened this way, explained No 1 " When a story teller hits the mark he makes mint of money , but if he only goes very near and just misses it though he may be enjoys as good as the beaches makes next door to nothing there a the funeral Such is fame and its commentators As a matter of fact, Anthony Trollope did make a good deal of money, though I fear not enough to put by my considerable sum but it was not so much by high prices as by constant work The largest sum he ever made by one book was I believe, by Fi meets Parsonage, for which he received £3,000 Several being writers have received more for single works, Wilkie Collins is known to have had £3,000 for Ainutdale, but none, perhaps, on the whole, have made so much by their pen at Trollope What is not taken into account when folks talk of big game is the great length of some of his earlier book The same thing may be said of Dickens and Thackeray They wrote novels beside which, in mere contents, the ordinary three vol um o novel is as one Volume This very important fact (when we talk of figures is always omitted by those gentlemen who affect to tell its all about the gains of modern authors Mr Ashmead Bartlett offers to give up his seat for Eye if Mr Chamberlain will give up Birmingham and then to try conclusions with him for Liverpool The loss of an eye in this case is not, however, a very serious catastrophe, and to exchange Birmingham for it would hardly be to fulfil the Scriptural dogma of an eye for an eye , it is more like bartering an eye tooth for an eye, which is a swept out of all proportion A great deal of comment (and no wonder has been made upon the conduct of a witness for the defence in the Lough Mask murders who acknowledged that she had lied unless tatingly, because ' there was no cross on the book she was sworn upon, ' 1' no doubt exhibits a religious sense ment not distantly akin to African socialism but there are many people, after all who hold pretty similar views, though they are not displayed in the same manner Every man who takes advantage of the notes sity of another to drive a hard bargain and flatters himself that he is free from blame in 60 doing, is in the same position " The law cannot touch me, he says , or, in other words, '"there is no cross on the book I kissed ' It is the same with hundreds of persons law) era, financiers, politicians, critics, who, not being actually in Newgate, persuade themselves that they have done no moral wrong As to the cross itself, that symbol iS peculiar to the Catholic but in this country the Protestant witness is often found kissing the thumb instead of the Bible he is pressing with it, under the amazing belief that since he does not kiss the book itself his falsehood is not perjury It is a fact difficult to persuade what the advertisements call "a very large and important class that it is not the gold but the temple which enactments the gold, that is of real importance. In a late account of a little "difueuHy between the mob and the party of order in the United States, there appears to have been a most providential preservation of the military The police are reported to have fired and killed " five persons, and wounded 20 others, including a colonel the standing army of the Great Republic is not of large dimensions, but no nation under heaven possesses so many colonels, and considering that out of 25 persons taken at random (and apparently) fired at at random) only one should be in the enjoyment of this military rank, seems little short of a miracle Perhaps the telegram ought to have run killed and rounded 2" persons, including one who was not a colonel "I have been wondering during the last ten days whether I should like to be made Archbishop of Canterbury 'His chance was so slight of my being appointed to the past, that, as the mathematicians as), it might be "disregarded I could wonder quite freely and without any personal prejudice or embarrassment Of course, I could have been made everything is possible in an age which produces apricot jam from turnips and should I have said, ' lido episcopate In some points I should have improved the place-I mean the palace An American bishop once bitterly) complained to me that the hospitalities of his brethren of the Bench in England never included a cigar " There was no tobacco," reassured me, "even at Lambeth ' Well Ilia' I should certainly have remedied But in other matters I might have fallen into error If I saw two of my clergymen, in a parish full of destitute and heathen people, quarrelling over the cut of an ecclesiastical garment, I am afraid I should knock their heads together, which would probably be returning to a too early form of church discipline It I found another bent upon being a martyr because he was not allowed to waste candlelight in tho middle of the day, I should send my apparitor whom I should choose for his thews and Conewarre shake him which would pro- bably produce paragraphs in the High Church papers Ihenasno promotion would ever take place without a searching examination in the works of Scott and Dickens, the evangelical clergy who " object to novels would bealwayacomplainingthat they were debarred from"thehigherBpheresofusefulness, which is parsons for good livings 'The sympathy of the public would be with me, but I should suffer from cliques and coteries It must be impossible to be called " Your Grace, and never stir without a chaplain at one a heels, and at the same time to act naturally. To have £20,000 a year, but with the sacrifice of personal comfort-no, the offer, if it did come would come too late I had arrived at a period of life when comfort is every thing I decided that I would not take the primacy, The matter is over now, but I honestly confess: that I should have refused it on selfish grounds, and not to oblige Benson." It makes one very old to think that I was that gentleman's contemporary at college. Think of being contemporary of the Archbishop of Canterbury When I knew him he belonged to " the ghost club,' that undergraduate society I wrote you about, for the investigation of physical phenomena Observe the advantage of giving your mind in early life to spiritual things! If I remember right he could tell a certain dream story of a very striking and surprising fund An Archbishop, I suppose, may not tell stories, which, to my mind, by the bye would be another and a most serious draw back to the acceptance of such a post. I say "I suppose," for to judge by some recent memoirs this liberty of story- telling is not absolutely denied to Bishops " Oh, Sammy, Sammy, why did you ever keep a dear) And oh son of Sammy, what sum in four figures could ever have induced you to publish it I perceive that in reply to some remarks upon his amazing indiscretion he has naively replied, " Oh, but if you had only seen what I forebore to publish, you would have been amazed at my moderation. My own conviction is that when a man finds him self a literary executor his nature under goes a transformation The gravest man becomes a humourist, and the most respectable loses eight of the decencies I am credibly informed that the editor of Gas /les rear indecency 13 still utterly at a loss to conjecture what harm he has done to his deceased friends memory, and how it has come about that from having been one of the most respected of writers Carlyle has sunk to zero in the barometer of public respect, I am convinced that every man ought to edit his own posthumous works You will remember, Sir, that I fore told the success of Vice Vc <a before one word had been said of it masinglenowspaper save one It has turned out to be quite unprecedented, and what is still more strange, quotations are every where incidentally made from the book as if the author Total 20) were already a British classic I noticed two in the As the day set 1111 quite recently. Abishop the other day had the good sense to recommend the work upon the ground of its pointing out so much that is amiss in private schools and only last week I see the president of Kings College School defends that institution from the imputation of being mentioned in that lively satire "I hear, he said that the ice Vtt sa was once amongst us but if he has had King's College School in his eye he must be full of imagination indeed ' No school master or president can be got to admit that " Crichton house is at all like his school. The wholesome terror that a clever boy may thus excite in his pastors and masters is really most gratifying, just as the exposure of a certain class of charitable institutions 111 June 10 are did one's heart good Schoolboys and governesses owen great deal of gratitude to Anstey Guthrie and Charlotte Bronte The ex Empress has done a princely thing After long litigation (including an appeal to a higher court, which has supported her the Pharo Estate and castle at Marseilles (made interesting to us all through the pages of stone Case) have fallen into her hands a properly worth 160 000 The first use she has made of its possession is to hand it all over as a free gift to the municipality of Marseilles A queenly act, indeed, and one which, in 1 imptia el, had she not already given a taste of her quality as a ruler might have turned many to look with favour upon her dynasty If this gift had been conferred during her son s life, it might have been open to cavil, as it is, there can be nothing but praise to say of it I wonder by the way, whether they show the abbe s cell in the Chateau d If and the passage through which Edmund (not Mr Bates, but the other) used to visit it on all fours It ought to be unnecessary at this time of day to potatoes that the behaviour of persons on the scaffold has little to do with their innocence or with the righteousness of their cause, but because certain Irish murderers have " died game, it has seemed to some persons that they were, therefore, meritorious Even Irish agitators will have no sympathy for the miscreant Oberdank executed last week for an attempt to assas- Senate the whole Imperial family of Austria yet a more courageous man in a certain sense never existed No martyr ever suffered with more Jan 27 food indeed he excelled most martyrs from the circumstance of his smoking a cigarette as he stood under the gallows tree ' He knew neither religion nor God, he said, wanted no priests, and even ' refused the assistance of the hangman For all which absence of imagination he will doubtless be very much admired There is nothing in which our unpaid magistrates show their unfitness. so much as in their custom of inflicting fines for the offence of cruelty.
