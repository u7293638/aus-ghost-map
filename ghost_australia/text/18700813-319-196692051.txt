[?] A NIGHT WiTH A MADMAISr. ........ ... [prom CHAMBEns's^JouiiirAi,.] ': !?.'??; ? It was just such a .night as a sailor loves rra night of comparative peace, a soft breeze, an easy sea, arid the land an indefinite number. ;of miles ori the weather- bow. Our vessel was as ; tidy- a littlo craft as any in tho royal'havy, land :th'at is no small boast either. Her name was the May! Bee, and may bo she wasn't a1 saucy ono; when wo iuujjuir, wo aiiwivya won ; ,auu ituiiuk, loo,Jiaa we run away, we should^ have won the race also ; at an yrate, in thei/chase, thie slaver ney^r had the ghost of a chance that we drew a beo-line upon.; (Jin* cruising ground was the Indian/ Ocean, its length and breadth, from the cold waves of the far'sbuth, to Aden in, the sunny north; ' ' ! Well,' ori the present occasion, we were rather short of hands, ; and of heads too, if officers may: be regarded as such ; for three of our boats : were away on particular service ; and; as our engineer was on the sick. list, the fires were put, sail set,i arid ari unusual quiet reigned throughput the ship. It was past eleven o'clock,, arid our commander! had turned in. Icpuld hear. him snoring through the bulk-head, for his cabin was right: abaft our little -ward-room, -although in1 no -way, connected; therewith. My.pabin was the only /one of; those off the ward-r.pom' at . present ! occupied, the only other officer;, on board— saving/ the,' engineer.— being the, assistant-paymaster, whose cabin was outside in the steerage. ? . 'Into the further end 'of tho 'steerage led ? the companiori- ladderi' so that, in pur passagje to arid froin; the ward -rooin to the deck,.. we had to; cross it. ;.I was standing in my little box-like sancturii, preparing to go to bed, wheri the noise of approaching footstei^s inthe steerage attracted my attention. Imagining that some one was sick, Ihastily threw on my coat, and emerged, again iiito the ward-room, juBtas 'Mr/Travers^6ur:assistant-paymasterj entered by 'the other door. He held righi; in front of him, sbas to beihiddenfrbm anvone behind, a drawn cutlass, which, from signs and motions he made; I understood he meant irie to take charge of and eoriceal.'; I quickly did so behind my cabin curtain, and had scarcely accpmplislied the task, when/Mr. Wheeler, the engineer, stood in the doorway; and the assistant-paymaster, after pretending to borrow a candle, bade me good night arid re tired.-' /? ???;?

His dis ease was one of the worst forms of alcoholic mania ; in other words, a bad case of delirium1 tremens.' From, ono attack he1 had only recently recovered, being 'snatched from the' very ja-ys of death. His ; delusions . had been many ;. but principially he had the idea that a conspiracy was afoot onboard, having for its object the haras sing of him; Mr. Wheeler, in every way, and the .final abdrictipri of hia body, the binding of the 'same, bands'/ and : feet, and, the delivering/ of it to, the/'deep,/to/ afford food to :the sharks.'

'.Repeated, blows, with the knife at length dispelled thisdemon .;? and then :myriads of horrible insects ! came Irooping up'1 over 'the] table, and. covered the bulk-heads all around ; and 'See 1' he had 'cried to me, ' ' diarift »I see them on deck, springing up like jets 'of water} arid flowing away in streains, those white thick worms JVand now they were on him,: gnawing ? his flesh, eating his vitals.1 'Corruption !

Nay^ nay,' he whispered im petuously; at ihe same time holding mei back ;' 'not now— riot' now, doctor ; wait: til! the' blessed sun rises. In the dark, I could; not wrestle, with them, and it will, be so very i long till morning.. Will it burn ?' he added; pointing to the lamp in my cabin. ' ? ? i I nodded assurance ? arid then he pleaded with| such eloquence to be; allowed. to. renjain near the; light, and to sleep, bafore my cabin door./ttiat I atlastconsentod; and. spreading /a mat and.pil low for him, bade him. lie down;: He did so,' and before5 morning I ha'di every :reasori to repent oi my Juuuueas. xao tutu requeaieu jue to piace besido him a loaded revplver, , or at .least a bayonet or cutlass, whioh, having no airibition for a madman to mount/guard on me, I peremptorily: refused. An hour slipped away-- during which time he lay quite peacefully on the mat, soino-! times' closing his1 eyes, but .only to immediately reopen them,:, and gaze furtively and fearfully away, out into the ; darkness ,pf tho steerage, as if momentarily expecting the attack of an un seen foe. : ??'?'? ? ' ?????? ' ? All was by this time quiet, both foro and aft,, in the sbito, for it must have been long past mid night. * The tramp, trairip of the quarter-master, overhead, had stopped ; even tho cockroaches,; aftor a supper of corks, biscuit, , port-wine, and blacking, nod gone to roost, and the^ commander had ceased to jmore, from which' I argued ho had fallen into his second arid, deepest sleep. So there wasn't a sound to be heard, except the creaking of the rudder hinges, or the splash of the wavelets as they ripple'd past my cabin -^-a Bound that had so often wooed mo to sweetest,: dreamless slumber, and seemed even now inviting: mo to rest. Thinking it my duty; to remain pn watch, however, I had not turned in, but sat on' a chair beside my little cot, writing letters homo. Presently, 'Doctor,', said my patient. '€ thought you .had been asleep,' I answered. '* What can Ido for you ?' ' Wiyo me a prayer-; book, there's a good fellow,' he said, and I won't disturb you again.' 'I would, Wheeler, if I had one,' replied I, ' but you know I've the misfortune to have been, born Scotch and Presby-; tsrian ; but hero is a Bible ;' and I handed him tho book ''of books, , . /, , . ' / ? He took it, and thanked me, and I went on with my writing. I was not eo much preoccupied, however, as not to.perceive.that he thrice ; opened the book; read /very attentively;, and between each, time he prayed— silently, indeed, but so earnestly that the drops of porspiratiori stood in beads on his pale browi , '? This brow of his; .too; was' a i very; noble one ; indeed, he was; .when well; riot only a manly, good-hearted, fellow, /but a wise ? and well-educated gentleman.,. Thinking; that his present frame of mind augured nothing but good, ? and v that' (there; could ; not possibly be any. danger to himself or; -.me^moreover, feeling tired - I closed' my: portfolio, .and .without un dressing, threw myself .ori my bed-: with ithe in tention of snatching a fewi, 'hours' repo30y;ifnot sleep. ? I should hero mention that I had, ' only the day provioua, purchased1 from the ship's 'stores' a large clasp-knife, such as sailors usually carry.| This knifo I had left . lying ou my little table among the books and ether articles. !? ?.,: ; | I could not have been long in bed till rfell asleep, the last thing I remember being groans proceeding frpm' the mat in front of my door. 'I am a very light sleeper, and used to have con tinual rows with : my servant for ahakirig me in; the morning, telling h'irii that all'he had to db,in order to waken me was'to enter my cabin,' and; win k once or twice, 'iiow long l slept x-cannot aay, ; ? I believe it' must have ? been fully an hour ; but' when I did at last^'open my eyes,- 1 never felt tiiore wido-awake in all my life. I had not, so far as I knew, been1 dreaming, yet I awoke with a strange andindescribablesenaatiori' of im pending danger. It was as' though .???& cold, cold; shadow'had fallen uponor passed over my bridn; and senses.' - By the side! of my pillow stood '??Mr.i Wheeler, and my eyes opened directly on his: ?; I shallnever forget the. expression on his face;' it was not so much that it was dark and terrible—; it was tke furtive listeriing expression on 'it that seemed so strange; almost like a cat about to seize its prey.; ? In his hand, half -raised, he. held.my own clasp- knife— open- ! ??'??' ?'???'? ????-,? -n'^ 'Our eyes met, and for two. seconds, not more,1 1 looked at him; arid' yet in : those two seconds the devil' in him was conquered. I have often 'had reason to be thankful tiiat my wits did not desert me in time of danger^ and this'time my presence of mind saved me from: an- ugly death.. Had I ventured . to spring up with the intention of- sav- ing myself,he was astrong matt, arid undoubtedly would soon have overpowered me. But instead of this; I'morely said, iri as cool and peevish a voice as/I could command : ' Pshaw ! Wheeler, inan, don't ? wakeri ' a ; fellow.- You'll get the volume in the little book case.— Good-night1; I've to rise early :' and JI closed:my eyes, npt/how-i ever before I had observed the deadly1 weapon quickly concealed behind hia back, arid. the foolish simpering smilo of the : dipsomaniac succeed the stern, determined glance of tho would beassassin. 'He 1 he !' laughed the madman ; . 'I thought — he !ho ! Oh, hero is tho book. — Good night i sound sleep.' ' Yes,'1 thought I, '.my boy,,aria a nice sound sleep you were preparing for me.' A feeling of anger at that moment took possession of-me, and I felt I almost hated my unfortunate patient.''- ?? ? ;::'??; :? ?? . ? . ??'-.,. ? -? ?,.-. ?',,?.'. ? -...' j ' I had now very little inclination for sleep : arid; after _ reinairiing quiet for a few momenta, I began' to/ airiiulate restlessness ; '? theri' rubbing my eyes, Tsat up, yawnedjand said: ?'' Hang it; old Wheels, couldn't you. have got the book yourself,^ with/out rousing, me? I can't sleep- agairi. now : however, I may as well finish ? those letters. . With these remarks; Tswung'myself to the deck, and reseated myself to write. For some time I looked': everywhere; but ' hv vain, for the large; clasp-knife with which I ?- was to have been made; so intimately acquainted; - At last i I perceived. a1 little bit' of '-itsi polished iblade peeping but froiri beneath the :inat on which Mr; Wheeler had once more thrown himself. ' So, then,' thought I; -'-X-am- a- prisoner,., and ... mygaolor a madman. Tleasaritcbnsiileration !' There was little chance of any one cotriin^to/^myi aidt My only hope was, that' one of the men might be taken ill apoplexy, colic, . or. . cholera- morbus, I .did 'riot mind w.hat^ provided I should be seritfor./ -I was' very much in the positiori of the doctor in the old caricaturo,. praying: Heaven to Bend a: pestil-; ence among the people, 'that thy servant may not die of Want.' I knew; too, that if I roused his anger , or , suspicion,, by callirigfor /assistance or trying ioescape, ishould'be/.but as a child in his haridsj and he. would assuredly kill ime; 'If,' I thought, 'I could 'only, gain pos-j ?session of that awful knife ;' which I now: firmly believed I had been fated' to buy for my own ex ecution. How soori; too, might lie not;' with? the sudden impulse common.to such cases) spring/up^ and attack me ! It was !quito evident now thai his Bible-reading and! earnest . prayers' had been' meant only aspreparatiori for death. -Therowas thus1 'a method in his inadness.' '; AH the strategy I could BUnimon was now di rected to the gaining possession of the knife. First, I asked him ;to accompany me to the stcer-J age, where the dispensary was, for some medicine I told hini I 'wanted. He' simply sneered, as miich/'as to say: 'Do you think me so exces sively green /?' : 'You would bo all the better of an opiate, anyhow,' I said. For a moment he! seemed to approve of the plan.. 'Will you let me helpmyself to the morphia, theri V he asked ; , adding, to prevent my suspicions, 'you give' soj :iarge\1-a\'-dpse,/!you-::knbw/--'-v''\CeVtainly/-iTBaid,; niy hopes risjrig rapidly ;, 'you shall' help your self.' He seeiried to consider a moment, then concluded he would not budge ;? and my hopes foil again to zero, all the' move quickly that fora few minutes after this he;was Very restless, and his hand frequently disappeared below the mat, where I knew lie was fuiribling with the knife. :At length, a liappy- thought crossed me, and .act ing thereon, I got up, laid by my papers,: and pretended to begin to undress.' ' Ohy bother ation,' said I; winding up my watch/; ' it has stopped :,at 'one o'clock/: just giyo a peep there,' Wheelefj arid see what time it \s.' ','.', '' . .,JN'ow,)in order to do thi3, he had to get up and; stand' on a locker, close by; as the ^lpck was fastened to a beam overhead; and bn'it/level'witb! the upper deck. The bait tbbk.1. With ;cne frightened look ; at the darkened', 'wiird-room around him, ho mounted ; arid,/ as quickly as I could, I bent down and clutchod .tho knife, ; Not a moment . too soon, however, for he1 was down from his perch in a twinkling, arid at me liko a catamountain. ' With a fearful imprecation) / he sprang upon arid seized mo by the.twaiirriis ; ho tueri/daslied mo backwards into my cabin, and down against th'6' chest o£ drawers. . All the ner vous excitability of madness aided his powerful arms, and I felt as if in a vice,_ ' Tuts !',' crjed T frvrmnnr n. lftllirll +,}initffl» n. rlpnrllv town* r\yna' a*-' my heart — 'tuts! old Wheels ;. you hurt riio, man j_and I want the whitMe just half n minute,' Andl looked hira.straight in, tho face as I spoko. ??. And once again tho devilish look' left his : eyes, - the ferocity died away,; and hiB face resumed the old idiotic grin. .Then he laughingly released ino, saying,, as he retired to his .'mat': , ' You \yere too much for old Wheels, that time, Scottio.' ''And what;'asked I boldly; 'did you want with the knifo 1' ' Doctor,' he replied seriously, f' I mustrotire.' 'Retire ! What do you mean ?' I inquired.' _ 'Long hath tho' night .of, sorrow reigned,' said the poor man ; ''the, dawn shall -ring me rest ; and poor. Wheeler will die; or/the; captain will kill him, roll him up in a hamriiock,! and send him down, down among slimy, cra^l-: ing things arid terrible reptiles ; and they're all in tho plot, and all hate mo— all— all !' Just then four bells rang out sharp and clearly in the night air ; and for a short, time I almost hoped some one might enter tho ward-room,: andi relievo me from my trying situation. Some foot stepson the quarter-deck Ididhearr-it was butthe. relief of the man at the wheel ; thoy sbbri ceased,' and all 'was : silent as before. ' A short time' after- wards, the lamp in my cabin began to burn more dimly/ and give other indications. of an' early exit. I hardly knew whether to be pleased or otherwise , atthis ; a struggle with my maniac patient I felt sure I must have,: and1 daikness I kne.w-. would hasten. that event, and bring on tb.3 denouement.

' This report was never made,, for: just as I- 'was about; to descend, a dark; figure' glided stealthily past, loomed for one moment on: the bulwark between me and the starlight, then disappeared, and the plash alongside told me, .that the unhappy engineer had .thrown himself: into the sea; -'Man, overboard !'

I' .rushed , past ..the! man at the wheel ; to where, in the stem of the ship, two ; little.; brass 'knobs, '.like! dppr ;bell; haridles, told the position of ithei life-buoy^ i ; One was pulled, arid a, gleam ; of light Bprang up ;: then, the 'other, and. the .beacon dropped sullenly into the sea. ,.

'Man the quarter boats,, and lower ,away with a.will. -Jt is earnest, my. lads,' ho; added ; ,',.it is poor- Wheeler ;' for the men were used to besent away after the lifebuoy on many a dark night; as a species , of . drill., ; ' A . bottle of rum to, each, boat/, with an additional one, to the boat that; picks up the, officeri' , . , j /, They, hardly needed such' .encouragement, for the boats were manned and lowered as if by magic, and , were soon, swiftly leaving the ship,; heard, .though- hardly seen, arid dashing onto-, wardsthe , blazing beacon, that floated nearly a quarter of a mile off. Thebuoy/ seemed to be playing, a littjegame. of ,bp,-peep with us,. at one; , moment flickering and shining gaily on. the sum-: mit of a wave, and the next dipping; down, arid' hiding from sight, behind it.
