MAIN ROAD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. SIR The Parliament having in its wisdom granted about one third of the amount absolutely necessary to keep and maintain 120 miles of mainland, with bridges and culverts, in repair, it becomes imperative upon the Government to see that the sum annually voted is judiciously and properly expended, and that the ignorance exhibited by the labour employed on the line be no longer tolerated 'The process now in operation, over the portions I have used, is that of putting down metal on a muddy roadway, and than bespattering with, or rather burning the stone in an additional cost of dust from the side drains, " by way of blinding to make the stone set ' Surely so wasteful on expenditure of labour and material, and a system so opposed to the principles of road imputing, and laid down by Macadam will at once be put an end to If not, the Minister and his subordinates will, with your permission, again hear MACADAM'S GHOST.
