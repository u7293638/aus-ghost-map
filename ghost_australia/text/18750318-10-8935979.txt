MALAGANNA'S GRAVE. TO THE EDITOR OF TUB MERCURY. SIR,-In an extract from the "Cruise of the Freak, 1872," published by you this morn- ing. I find the following:-"A solid piece of masonry, bearing a tablet, with an inscription now almost illegible by exposure to the air, marks the resting place of the noble chief Malaganna, who, as a warrior, stood unrivalled among the aborigines, and was considered a sage of his tribe. He was the last chief removed to Flinders Island, where he died." Poor, broken-hearted Malaganna ! How, memory lingers round the brief closing words "where he died." May I ask you if the bones of this " sage " chiof still rest beneath the " piece of solid masonry " named ? I have good reason to think not, but that they were'ruthlessly torn away by a "body- snatcher" year ago, to grace (disgrace, not by their presence, but by being thus brought there) the Museum. I have not heard of their finding their way to that place, and if not yet confined to the "tea chest" in which they were placed for removal, they may have been sold to till the purse of one who forgot or disregarded the words of Him who said, " I am the resurrection and the life." Do you or any of your readers know what became of them ? If so, you or they would oblige by com municating the same to HIS GHOST. Maroh 17th, 1875.
