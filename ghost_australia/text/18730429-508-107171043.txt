'Oh. father,' she murmured, half rising, aud then the old feia-a, the doubts which ske bad had, aud which he had not uttered one word to dissipate, ruse uv-bi-f'ire her, mid she couldnot face the mystery oflisr future with him. It was leaving her real home— Hester and Antuuio— it was surreuderir.5 them botk for one whom it was impossible to road, aud she was not brave iu that huur, only a weak, sick girl, who would be tvue to all of thuai if it lay in her power.

All was ovev, the choice had yc-eii made, and the man was alone iu the world. He went at a rapid pace along the high road, as though he would uutv-alk tbe bitter associations which had met him iu his birth place, and all that dinrrust-if him which he bad cnine thousands of miles to experience. He was tired of Wolsloii : he had made, up his mind to be gone, aud there was iiotbi g, he ?was certain, that nee-3 detain him for another hour. At the inu be asked to see the land lord, and in a harsh, peremptory tone, de manded his bill. ' Are you going away to-night, 6ir?' 'Yes, lam.' ' It is verv late.' wasthe remark of tlw- inn. keeper, as if he were doubtful if Joint Garth had taken lately any heed of time. ' I know it. But I must get away.' ' Indeed, sir !' Something in the landlord's face annoyed him, and he said, mockingly, ' I may be locked up agnin— can't you see that ? You are one of the wise folk of Wolston, and know what 1 am. Get me the bill.' The landlord had not left the room when Garth called to him again. ' Yes, sir. What is it, please ?' 'Find some one who will row me, at his own price, to - hestwich.' 'To Chestwich, Mr. Garth P' ' Don t' Air.' me,' said Garth, abruptly. '1 am Colonel Garth, late President of .aJs*ko Give me my right title and digm'ty niau. Had you insulted me in the parts whence 1 hare come, you might hav.i bf-sn shut. ' '1 — I really had no imeutim of insulting yon, colonel.' 'Find s-iue one to row me to Chi'stwioh. at his own price, will you. ' I will try.'' The landlord departed, and went to the vil lage in »e:ircb of one of bis watenueu.

' Is not that man ready ?' asked John Gurtl impatiently. 'I II look him up again,'1 rejilied the la::d 'ord, hastening :-.wuy. When he returned, John Garth was standing on tbe bridge, looking down into the deep dark i.ich. wherein oae night Gregory Deerham met his death bluw. ??' ' » ?? I wish it had been I,' he said to Mmself before the landlord had approached bim. ' Peo ple respected him, and believed in him, and hes missed.' ' 'he boat is ready, colonel,' said the land lord, bland and smilinc, after tbe fashion of luidlvirds who have had their own way, and whose bill has not been a subject of discussion, '?ti- 11-17 Cu part with you, - 'olonel Garth, and I hope you have been comfortable.1' ''Jh, very comfortable; I don't know when I have enjoyed myself more,' .said Garth, sa tiricituy, us he walked frein tbe bridge to tne water's edge, where the waterman was waiting t'jr him. '?' I hope we ehail soon see you again at Wol«ton r' the host continued. ' Never in this accursed place,'' Garth shou ted with a suddem violence that made the land lord spring into the air. '? Wby don't jdu leave wr ? Haven't you been paid enough f ' '? Yes, sh- -thank you— certainly.' Garth looked down upon the waterman, a hale and stalwart fellow, aud a striking con trasc to one Robert Smith, who had rowed him from Chestwich to Wolston a few weeks ago. ' You are not afraid of work ?' said Garth. ' N'o, sir, not a bit,' was the answer. Garth stepped into the boat, sa,t down, and drew his cloak closely around him. ' Row off, then.' ' All right, sir.' Garth sat back, a grim dark fignre, which did not move again till daylight. The boatman remembered till his dying day that long and silent journey, the immobile cauntenance 1'iwe riug from the ebadow of the felt hat, and the dull dead apathy which was stamped upon it, and which time did not seem to influence. J»ka Garth thought hard, aad passing things belonged not to the life he was consider ing. He did not regard the yacht of Antonio Baretti as they ro- vedpast it, or the man who called tbem aud asked whither they were going u,t 6« lute an hour ; he did u«t even look to wards tbe g -eat white house where he had lost hope, and where his daughter lived ; there was uo interest for anything beyond the grave world in which h~ had submerged himself. Pacing from VTolston Broad to the narrower river where the rushes grew, gliding by the villages lying at the fair water's, edge, resting at tue old inn — at the Bed Lion, where Mrs. HoLtou had married her barman and repented ydaraaju — stealing on from day to day, aud meeting in their course ships heavily ladea and jl&usure; yachts making for the sea, being passed at times by vessels and yachts bound in their direction, and then finally amengst the houses, factories, and wharves, with the lights of a large city flickering iu the water, and people looking from the sides of ships, and from bridges, and landing-stall's at them as they r»wed t* shore in the twilight of one Sep tember niffht. It was beginning' «rer again — there had been much o£ life and hope, snd prayers lest, and much o£ »ew misery and n.2iioti*n gained, jolonel John Garth thought as he rtont up tke landing-stairs with his Icuap tack »n his shoulders, and his cloak thrown across his arm. ' Why, is it you, sir p' asked Eobert Smith, the only man to recognize him, and take stock o); his return. ?' Ho — it s my ghost, Smith,' he said dryly. '? 1 was killed at Wblstoa, and my restless spirit walks abroad.' He passed his questioner without glancing towards him, and btrudc up the steps into the daikueas of the streets. j Robert Smith aud hid brother boatman from I the Wolston inn, ttoed looking after biiu. ; . ' They made. WV.lstuii too hot for him. then, j mate ? ' said Smith. j ?? At, I tiiijtk they did,' was the reply. ' Didn't lie worry you to get ou sharp and fast r'1 j ' No, he didn't ; he didn't seem to care.'' : 'iiow he's altered! You may depend upon it, that he did that job at Wolston Bridge ; and he ? a lucky fellow to get off scot free.' ?' Yes, that's true. He was precious hiclcy there.' Lucky! John Garth did not know that there were men still living who considered him a lucky man. He wont away considering him self tae most unfortunate wretch upon earth, and assured tuat no one let t iu 'VVulston or Chestwich believed in any good in him. As he returned to bis native place, so lift passed away once more, with every man's hand and every woiuim'a heart against him. That was John Garth's luck,|he thought. |'to be continued.]
