FRAGMENT FROM AN OLD LATIN ODE. A DULL deep pain is at my heart, My eyes are wet with bitter tears, That gush from lhat still silent fount The memory of bygone years. Oh! that within the iron gate3 "Where death receives the trembling ghost, Some spot were found-some quiet nook "Whare we might converse with the lost! Where, far from life and light, and pain, In that still shadow of the tomb, Our tools might meet with theirs, and they Fill in our hearts the vacant room. Oh ! kingdom rich in conquered spoils! Oh ! land whence none cÂ«n e'er return ! The soul is shut and barred in thee Eten as the dust within the urn. -Jane V. mpson. ? j I : \
