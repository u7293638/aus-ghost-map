HAPPIEST DAYS. BY ALICE CART. The clouds in many a windy rack Are sailing east and west, And sober suns are bringing beck The days I loved tlhe beat. The poet, as he will, may go To summer's golden prime, And set tile roses in a row Along his fragrant rhyme. But as for me, I sing the praise Of fading dlowers and trees, For, to my mind, the sweetest days Of all the year are these. When stubbly hills and hazy skies Proclaims thb harvest done, And Labour wipes his brow and lies A.dreaming in the sun And idly hangs tihe spider on Her breoken silver stair, And ghosts of thistlees, dead and gone, Glide slow along the air lWhere all is still, unless, perhape, The cricket makes ado, Or when the dry- billed heron snaps Some brittle reed in two Or rahool-boy tramples through the bure, His tangled path to keep, Or ripu mast, rustling downward, stirs The shadows from their sleep. Ay, he that wills it so may praise The lilies and tile bees; But, as for me, the sweetest days Of all the year are these.
