!'-;:£:-;: ' DEAN FLANAGAN. An Emmaville correspondent writes : — The weight of eighty summers having begun to tell on the Very Rev. Dean Flanagan, that popular priest is about to sever his connection (after a period of nearly eight years) with a people by whom he is revered and re spected. Father Coue, of the Marist Fathers, is at present officiating for the Dean, who has been on a visit to his Lordship Dr. Torreygiani at Armidale. As the good Dean' is returning about the 9j;h November to wish us good-bye, steps are being taken to give the genuine and patriotic old 'Sojr- garth Aroon' 'a farewell worthy of his long, faithful, and generous services. As an instance of the Dean's popularity among those besides his own creed, I may tell you that a Protestant gentleman of this place, after expressing his admiration of the Dean's good qualities of head and heart, said to me recently, 'My dear Sir, men as good as Dtv-m Flanagan, are not born nowadays;,'' a statement which would in. itself stand for a page of narrative. Although the Dean's unbounded charity endeared him to all classes, yet never, when occasion re quired, has he ' feared to speak of '98.' Indeed, his love for his race entitled him (in the estimation o£ the cunning concoctors of the Kiama Ghost plot) to a prisoner's place in one of Parkes's penitenti aries. But Captain Charles, a liberal Protestant gentleman, seeing the villainy of the ^host-makers, immediately ' bailed out' tho Rev. Fenian? The Dean still laughs heartily at the hi«h compliment paid him, and it is quite u treat to hear him de scribe his short prison experiences and amusing in uidents intended to incrimimitu innuuunt people. I will be present at the farewell bauquct.
