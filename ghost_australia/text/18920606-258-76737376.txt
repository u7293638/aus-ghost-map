FOOTBALL. British Association Rules (by onlooker) The match, Scotland v All Comers, came off on the Queenton Rangers ground on Saturday afternoon, the team which played the Rugby selected last Saturday week, rep- resenting Scotland, Cook (full-back) being the only absentee, he, through sickness, being unable to play. For the All Comers, Fogg, Armour and Mellemby failed to put in an appearance, thereby weakening the team con- siderably. In the first half of the game the result was Scotland two goals to nil. In the second, half, although playing against a strong wind, the All Corners held their own, several times having very hard luck at their oppo- nents goal and it was only in the last four minutes of the game that Scotland scored their third and last goal. It is needless to make comments on the individual players, as the two teams worked their hardest, but great credit is due to the several novices who played in the All Comers ranks for the hard uphill game they fought. The Scotch "ghosts" form was a long way superior game to what they have shown this season.
