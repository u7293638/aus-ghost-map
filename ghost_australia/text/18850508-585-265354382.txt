WA0AMB1E HAUHTED. Quite a sensation was caused in the township last night through a rumor being spread thai .a ghost was seen sauntering about tilt old State school. The man who brought the information seemed so tliojonjhly frightened that a number of men accompanied Jiim to the place, one of the number carrying a revolver. On arriving at the place a tall white £guio was seen to enter the building, and the brave volnn. teers, thinking it to be a practical joke, rushed in after it, but to their utter.dismay "the building was empty, and to add tothd' ecare tbero was ho visible'mean's of egfeap, only.through tbe door they had entered, •the windows being all paled up. The mine hardly able to believe their own eyes, left the mysterious place hurriedly, and when crossing ihe yard they were again brought face to face with the mysterious being, who was sitting on the top »il of the fence en- ' 'closing the building. The man with the revolver stepped forward a'pace and said "Speak or Til fire," and there being no reply he let blaze, but as if by magie the apparition had totally disappeared. It hardly seems probable that any pel's oil would or could play a trick of this kind) but if such is tbe case we hope the police will spare no exertions in bringing the person to -his or her senses. We have heard it whispered that lights hare been seen in this place after nightfall, when no persons were even camped near it.
