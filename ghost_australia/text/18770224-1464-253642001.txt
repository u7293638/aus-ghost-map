A VALENTINE TO MacELHONE. Gliost of the Honso. Devoid alike of decency, and Arise ! and to the vulvar gaze he shown, That, seeing, all may slum John McHellown. Dignams and Taylors, ignorance and slang, Upon thy grimy lips congenial liang : Thy croaking voice, thy unshorn face, thyself, Are symbols of a mind as common as thy pelf : 'Tis such as you, John Drag, a people's choice, That cast a slur upon the ballot's voice ; "Wise men could never iu the face of day Make you their mouth-piece, though bad selectors may. Let us forecast the biographic page That will pourtray this legislative sage : " He was a man looked at from head to foot, That seemed unwashed, or else he washed in soot, With sunken eye, 'neatli low, retiring brow, That sought for vengeance, asking for it " now He'd rise to speak, to scratch his head, and stammer Some hackneyed speech, oblivious of grammar : Those sounds that fright the car when some brave ship Strains plank and mast in ocean's mighty dip, The groan and creak, and whistling of the wind Are music to his voice — t'was thunder unrefined. His Maker's name he'd introduce full oft ; In benediction, never — unless the man hiccoughed. He'd " wish, and pray, and hope to Him above," That lie could give some hated one a little of his love. His inane words would follow in such inflected style, As made you think eacli word the last, or hope it wa g the while. His voice was coarse, his language coarse, the man himself was coarse ; And yet the people choose him, for the want of something worse. Ayaunt ! .John Mac-aroon, to school, and learn What grammar is, then next you might discern The difference between a gentleman and " rough : " Of the stMviict' in modo we cannot have enough. Cultivate the heart, and educate the mind : Man is none the less a man when a bit refined. " Condemn not ere you judge " is a homely saw ; Traducing men when honest is against the law. VOX POPULI.
