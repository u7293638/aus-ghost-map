Percy Dean, a lad |16 ; years of age,- was; charged with . wantonly, barking apple ; trees, the '..property. of John, Smith, -and was fully committed ; after which Arthur Sherwin was charged with aiding ; and abetting, the prisoner in the offences From .the evidence -published ? in , the Mercury it appears ..that Smith and Sherwin. are neighbours, residing at the. Upper Huon,- and that. for some.time past a very bitter feeling has.existod between' them. Percy Dean; who, is Sherwin's nephew, and resides with him, admitted; that at Sherwin's instigation he had gone to Smith's premises three nights. On the first occasion he poisoned Smith's dog; on the next destroyed 16 apple trees by ringing them ; and :,on the third pulled down, the fence, chopped up potatoes, broke branches of trees, and finished by stabbing ahorse. Sherwin, who was de fended by Mr A. L Clark, denied; the evidence of Green, and called witnesses; to disprove his veracity, who stated that they would not believe his (Dean's) .path.' After lengthy evidence, had been, given, Sherwin was fully committed, for trial, bail being allowed in two sureties of £50 each and himself in £100.

If this were decided upon,' it would be necessary to hire, a small ?? portable; steam-engine for generat ing -the: electricity, and- then 'the light could be i easily tried in various parts of tho.town. 'In reply to Alderman Button, Mr. Joseph said he did not think his Com pany would share with' the Council the cost; of making an experiment in Launccs ton, as it already hadinore orders in hand than it; could get through for several: months'/ In the'event of the town being generally1 lighted by electricity, Mr Joaoph concurred in the opinion that the water-power of the South Esk might be utilised cheaply for generating electricity.
