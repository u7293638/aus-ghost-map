ORIGINAL POETRY. THE "QUIZZING ROCK" OF DELORAINE. In Blarney Castle, so grim and old, Lies a stone, once worth its weight in gold; But now it yields its world-wide fame To the "Quizzing Rock," of Deloraine. The Western Railroad now would pay, For hundreds would come out this way, To catch a glimpse as they'd leave the train Of the "Quizzing Rock," of Deloraine. Old "Quamby's Bluff" must hide his head, And bitter drops the "Tier" may shed, And the "Sugar Loaf" may melt with shame, Near the "Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. If Solomon liv'd, he'd own t'was true, Tasmania at least, had something new, And the lovely West can this triumph claim-- In its "Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. The Surveyor-General is about To make a new chart of the Island out, He'll depict no doubt in colours plain, This "Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. This new found rock (Geologists say), Has too- thirds brass in its pristine clay, Loadstone and tin, too, a slender vein, In the '"Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. The "honest folks" of the fertile West Are often "quizzed"—'twill be confess'd, And Justice herself, seems quite insane, 'Neath the "Quizzing Rock"' of Deloraine. Some say that Neptune with angry roar, Cast it in wrath on Tasman's shore, Others affirm to volcanic flame, We owe the "Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. If it be an Ærolite dropped from the sky, Astronomers, of course, will learn by-and-by; Stutzer its hist'ry, perhaps could explain, When he comes to Iecture in Deloraine. But I'll tell you the strangest part if true, Church, Medicine, and Law partake of its hue; "Ye're all gone daft," I heard Sandy exclaim, About the "Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. No wonder indeed old Blarney stone, You die of grief in your castle home,— But sure your ghost can cross the main, To the "Quizzing Rock" of Deloraine. SCHWARTZ. Deloraine, June 14th.
