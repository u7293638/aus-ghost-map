Mr. Batey was wont to' relate an incident in connection with his first camp out which fhows what an almighty scare the unaccountable will give to us at times. It would appear that Ke got to the Plenty with John Watt, a young Sydney aboriginal, too lato' to pitch the lent. They were obliged to rig it up a» a one-sided slanting gunyah, and when the hour for retiring came, they squeezed themselyes under the hastily constructed shelter. It might have been at that hour that ghosts are supposed to takes nocturnal constitutional, when all at onee the holy calm of the Austral night- was enriched with the vocalisation of a member of the New Holland fauna. Mat. Beyatty, ss his GeprilierOTuntrymenjwo^ •Jinn,-- injstOTd'^i ^o^g chariiieS OT strange harmbny,:was faacinated in the direction of unadulterated.horror. He actually believed the sounds proceeded from a snake, and in that thought he fired both boots into the blackness of the night, in tiie hopes bf scaring a^vay the intruder. The volley failed to pro-: (luce the desirod effect, and, if he had any desire to investigate, bis pedal encasements being gone,' he was restrained py : the fear of putting his foot oh the reptile. In this .dilemma he appealfed to the darkey as to what was.causingi the disturbance, but Jack could not tell. The reason for this Was, probably,' due to the fact that' Jack had been taken when a piccaninny from a wild tribe and reared exclusively in: the, capital of- ; the sister colony. " Next" morning an old stager showing up, he was informed of. the. circumstances, and he burst into a laugh of large dimensions. On the subsidence of his "hilarity, lie exclaimed,," Why-it was a -——— possum." As regards Black Jack, when the FliutofFs put cattle on. the- ground he was employed as stockman. It was observed that Sis horses became high in bone, and the .reason .of that was discovered in the;.fact: that Jack, was-in the. habit of spurting to town with undue frequency for his own particular pleasure; ... This fellow told my father t'hat when in Melbourne one Sunday, he: went to church., He, said, lie .saw people taking pieces of bread;, and g! ling forward; he took two bits, where-, upon the parson shook his head at him J Certain of the people were taking the communion, but'tlie autochthon, thinking it was a free feed, went forward to* help himself. When Fliiitoff dismissed him he was never heard of afterwards. It was supposed his sable brethren had effectually • stamped liim out, a thing those people were much addicted to, especially when the, coloured gentlemen came from parts remote. The aboriginals of this continent, .from nil I have read or heard about.them, in lulling thbse ^ of their own eploiir appropriated the. kidney fat of their viotimf:. TKe.y ; 1 La.d *L'bcHet, l stand, that if tliey rubbed tlie soles of ' tlieir feet with this fat, .it enabled them to sneak silently upon kangaroos. Another of, their . ideas was, if tliey greased.theirb;pdifeB":.witii lt^'fch^ absorbing the strength of the dead man. More than , that, if I err npt, in a small hook that a Mr Jlayden published fifty years ago or more, that gentleman says the fat was in greater esteem if it, could be abstracted before the fallen foe had shuffled off this mortal coil. To conclude tliis chapter,"'as.!.JohnV Watt evaporated completely from off tlie sci-ne, it is reasonable to assume that he was partially used :up as a lubricant and the balance of his remains;thrust down,a.hollow gum tree. . ] i .
