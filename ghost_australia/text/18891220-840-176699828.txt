It .were a different aspect now. ,; The, glow of sunlight had faded, the , evening had benome dull and. chill ; or seemed. ,sq to Viotor Pen riogton. . The house ''an;! 'garden, neat and trim as they were, looked opld an3 forbidding. Penringtoh, though some years older than Phyllis, loved her dearly and truly ; he was grave and sad- when he thought of the past and the future. But ' was he not innooent of any crime.? Had he been, guilty hia position, even though he was' unsuspected, would have been different. So he argued. He would ;have quitted the , Holme that very night,;hadhe not appointed to' wait for Long hands the detective, and did he not feel that his absenoe might be misconstrued. This duty, as it undoubtedly was, held him fast ; although Ms inclination then -was to fly from the .Holme forever. ' ; He returned homo, and decided to write a letter to Phyllis begging her to see him, or at -any rate to explain the reason of her moat «ztraordinaiy conduot. The servant met him in the garden, and informed him that a person wished to see him on business. ' Who is he'?' inquire Viotor languidly. : 'Don't know, sir,' he said, ' hisname was Long— or something short like that' At any other time Viotor would have smiled and exchanged a jest with the woman, but his heart -wan too heavy for jesting then. ' Where is he ?' he asked 'ooldly. 'In your room, sir; that's where he is.' 'In my private room. : Have not I told you never to permit; anyone to enter that room f Why isn't it looked? Is it looked?' ? ' Mebbe it be,' was all the reply she vouch safed, as Penrington hurriedly entered the library, from which the room in question opened. AH was Beoure. HefouDd the detective seated in an arm chair, gazing out of the window, a cigar alight between his fingers. Mr. Longhands appeared somewhat disoonoerted by the sudden appear ance of the owner of the Holmo, but with1 an apology he quickly recovered hia selfposses sion, and said : ' Good evening, sir. Here I am, you see.' 'Yes, I see,' replied Penrington, easting a rapid glance around him, and walking up to the door of communication with his private apartment, he looked it and withdrew the key. , ' Well,*' he continued ; havo you any news ?' 'Yes, some. I have ascertained that Ralston has bolted aoross the water — so 'tis said, any way; and I have telegraphed to our men at the port?,' replied the deteotive, who had remarked the looking of the door with some curiosity. ?? J.UUU, wnai qo you propose to aor assoa Viotor. ' I shall follow him up. I hear he has gone Bristol way. The local constabulary are after him, too. I shall be off almost immediately. There was no early train, or I wouldn't be here now. Have you any due, sir?' ' None,' replied Penrington briefly. 'Didn't I see you and a lady, sir, oKHsinpf the field ? Yes, I thought so. She was Miss vAIoioft, I'm told.' ' Yea ; but that has nothing to do with the case.' ' Oh, we can never tell. There may be a clue in this, or there may not be. Straws tell ns how the wind blows, and many a promising case has been upset by the negloofc of triflea,' said Longhands, senteritiouply. 'Very true,' replied Victor calmly. ' Have you anything morn to oommunioate ?' 'No; but I must be off . Excuse my cigar, sir, please. I've' a habit of smoking, it isn't quite the thing on duty, but it's soothing ; not exactly professional, butit's.pleasant. Good night, sir.' h' Good-night,' replied Viotor absently. His mind had already travelled far from the detective. . . ? '? ; . ' ' 'There's Eomething on that gentleman's mind,' mnttered Longhands aB he turned away., 'He has a weight on his spirits. Why did he look that door, I wonder ? Where does it lead to ? I wish I could pump the old lady, bnt'Bhe'B dry as a limekiln, and won't answer a question.

'Tour suggestions are moat insulting, and I will hear no more.' She drew herBelf up very haughtily, and qnittod the ' room hastily, ' to avoid all further qnestionirig. ' 'This kind of thing won't do,' muttered Mr. Lon'ghaiide, ' I must mask my batteries. I shall have to hunt up Balston, after all. I'll keep an eye on Penrington, ? too. I'm sure they've quarrelled. By Jove 1 I'll ask him plump out. But it's too late now ; I'll go baok to the Maid. I oau't get off to-night. , The £200 is worth having.' , , , ' , The Mermaid, generally, known as, the Maid amongst its frequenters, was possessed of a spacious bar and parlour in whioh many village politicians aired their views, and argued with as much foroe and eloquence as Iriah homorule members. To this parlour did the deteotive adjonrn, in the hope of obtaining nomo oluo by whioh he migh: tiaok' tho murderer.of Mri Aloroft. ' ' '?? ',.??'., When Longhands entered the parlour the animated conversation suddenly ceased. The eyeB of , every gossip were fixed npon him in doubt, and some with fear., A polioeman from London was a personage in thoir eatimition, and hiB power's' were magnified. ' Maybe he carried warrants in his pooket with blanks for the namea of people to be immediately in scribed as murderers of the deoeased gentleman. No one ventured to speak, and some of the men even made a movement aa if to withdraw. The detective perceived thie, and hastened to stop it. ; '? Come, ladg, you've no cauae to be afraid ; I ain't goin' to hurt ye. I'm not on duty here. Call for what you like, gentlemen, and I'll stand the raoket. What shall it he ? Now; Bay the word.' 'Couple o' gallons o' old ale,' suggested one individual at length, looking round at his friends'. 'Bight!' exclaimed Longhands, ' we will have it in. One gallon at a time will do, I suppose?' ' Save trouble to hayo it at one go,' re marked another. Eh, Ben f' ' Aye, it won't get so flat, Jim,' replied his friend. ' Here, my lass,' he oos tinned' to the plump, dark, girl, who officiated as barmaid ; ?' get us a oouplo of gallons o' old ale, d'ye hear ?' ' Two gallons !' exclaimed Batty, 'Aye, two; and here's the money,' Bald the detective. 'You can keep the change, my girl.' The barmaid thanked him, and in due time the ale appeared in two eans, giving an aver ige of about u pint and .three quarters to eaoh in dividual, which was a 'very fair allowance con sidering what the party had already imbibed. Mr. Longhands said nothing. He lighted his pipe and contented himself by nodding his acknowledgments to the ' good healths' whioh were bestowed upon him. As ho anticipated, the ale loosened the tongues of his companions. ' 'TwaBn't Harry as did it ; not him. He isn't the man,' said one at length. ' 'Ain't he? Thbn whoisP' said another. ' Aloroft hadn't any enemy, had ho P Who, did it? No one can't toll. I didn't, I know! that' ' ' i 'We don't know but ye didn't; Alfred,'; said a waff. 'We've only your wordfor 't.' ' ' Ye'll have my fist, for ,'t next, then. No ; it were snsanside — killed himself, ha d'd.' '? , , 'Blather,' replied another, '?he,oouldu't si struck hisself like that ; and whore's the tool as done it? Find that first. It wasn't there when Joe oome and called me for to remove th.9 body. No, it waBn't.' ' If ho had a-Buaided he'd have let fall the tool as he done it with, wouldn't ho? Very well. There it 'nd a bin found. ' Very well, and it baint found, so it ain't no suside: He's a murdered man,' oonoludod Ben. ' 'Muster Penrington he was away, absant, when it were done, wa'n't he P' i 'Aye, Penrington were' away.
