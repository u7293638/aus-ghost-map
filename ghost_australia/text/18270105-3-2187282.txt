EFFUSIONS OF INSANITY. Two amorous swains, in your Paper I see, Bid farewell to the year twenty-six, The one writes a sonnet, the other a glee, Both mourn o'er their juvenile tricks. They whine and they sigh and they sigh and they whine, As if twenty-seven would cheat them; Mr. S. who is mumpish, afraid ere he dine That a ghost, like his fathers he'll meet them. Then S. like a fugleman to E. O'S. Gives the signal for love in a ditty; E. O'S. then complains that his Jean or his Bess, Like any sweet girl that is pretty, Has left him, by breaking some old iron chain, Because she of chains had been weary. Regardless of Mr. O'S. or his pain, As she had got tired of her deary; Then he watches, poor fellow, the gleaming of day, As they pop themselves off in the distance. And then, to be sure, the night comes in his way, And he's left without any assistance; These thoughts bubble up in his muse-loving brain--- His mind it becomes wild and dreary; He laments that the past he can ne'er see again; Poor fellow, he's love-sick and weary! But why should'st thou funk, my sublime E. O'S? Thy hopes by to-morrow may brighten; Thy griefs can't be more, but they well may be less--- Twenty-seven thy burden may lighten. OUR lasses are fair---may be faithful mayhap--- Woo a charmer, my lad, she may cheer thee. A bad one, I grant, is old Lucifer's trap; Take care that none such may come near thee. But take to thyself a sweet rose- blooming dame, And thy hours they will glide along gaily; At breakfast with butter and rolls line thy frame, And THY HEAD WITH THE PAPER THAT'S DAILY! TWIST 'EM.
