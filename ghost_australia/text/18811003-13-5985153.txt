THEATRE ROYAL. I HfS. ttARKlNS AS HAMLET I "Hamlet" was played at the Theatre Royal on Saturday evening, with Mr D H. Harkins, an actor quite new to Australia, as the prince Mr Harkins has a good presence, an excellent voice, in which there still linger slight traces of his American birth, a sign fairly clear utterance, and elocutionary abilities of high quality, though it may be doubted if he alwajsuses these gifts to the best advantage No visitor to the theatre expecting to see the Hamlet of his imagination The character is an expression of the passions and the interest depending more on the thoughts than on the action and it is this insubstantiality which makes the part so difficult to embody Mr Harkins has en dently applied himself with enthusiasm to the study of the great dramatist, diligently searching for his true meaning, and he presents a conception which is his own, in marked by an) slavish adherence to tradition We may all add our pebble to the great cairn of criticism which has been raised on this admirable play, and the new candidate for popular favour should be welcomed as an addition to the Blender ranks of honest Shakspearian exponents. The Hamlet presented by Mr Harding is a man dominated by an overmastering sorrow for the loss of his father's sorrow upon which scarcely any other feeling ever plays, and the unity of effect is carried out with extreme fidelity. The distinguishing tones are laid on with a heavy hand, but there is no skilful arrangement of contrasts and subordinate gradations-no flashes of sunlight or fitful play of fancy to relieve the general gloom. This is a defect in art Besides, it must be remembered that Hamlet was a young man, in the south of.ptimy nature," and that there is a certain buoyancy in the character without which it loses some of its fascinating interest The idea is consistently worked out, however, and Mr Harkins seems to hold so strongly the view that Hamlet was a man who " vacillates from sensibility and procrastinated from thought till he loses the power of action in the energy of resolve,' that he never really rouses from his lethargy till the last scene of all, when in mad rage, with a passionate vigour of action which is quite refreshing after so much doubting, he says the king Mr. Harkins IB, of course, letter perfect in the text, and he gives no now reading Some of the " business, however, differs from that most in vogue The ghost, as it appears upon the battlements, is habited in neutral tinted clothes, with a gauzy veil thrown over the head. This certainly aids the illusion as to the visitant being a bodies apparition, but we must confess to a preference for seeing at this point in the drama " the majesty of buried Denmark' "armed at point, exactly cap a pie," because of the repeated references in the text to the figure being armed A very good effect is produced in the closet scene by the ghost, dressed in court costume, emerging from a portrait of the dead king in one of the panels of the oak wainscoting, Hamlet having a moment before directed the attention of his mother to the picture Here there is excellent authority for dispensing with the armour, the stage direction in the corrected folio of 1032 being "enter ghost unarmed." The ghost scenes were all managed with picturesque effect, a strong light being made to play on Hamlet's face throughout his colonies with the perturbed spirit Mr Harkms'a opening address to the apparition, kneeling in an attitude of filial piety, was impressive and affect ing, When he interrupts the narrative of the crime with the words " O my prophetic soul, he pronounces " mine uncle" almost assent ingly, v. it bout the more customary interro- gative rise of the voice and in a way which expresses confirmed knowledge of a horrible suspicion In questioning Horatio and Mar- celina in regard to the apparition, speak- ing to his friend he adopts John Kemble's reading of the line "Did you not speak to it? laying the emphasis on the second word, showing that he expected that from one who knew his father so well, which is to be preferred to the common habit of emphasising the word speak The great soliloquy, " Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I in common with the other soliloquies, was delivered with an entire absence of any attempt at declamatory effect, and in the natural colloquial style of a man thinking aloud, but with well proportioned emphasis The concluding words, " Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain,' were given in an affecting tone of heart broken sorrow He makes an excellent point at the end of the act, where it flashes across his mind that the play's the thing in which to catch the conscience of the King, b) hurrying to the table, where as the curtain falls he is writing the speech of some dozen orBixteenhneB 'for"TheMarderof frontage ' In the interview with Ophelia Mr Harkmsdis played with pathetic power the torture of the Prince's mind when, talking at the concealed listener, he disguises his love for her in the terrible language of a madman. Before giving way to the assumed paroxysm ho show B by an eloquent gesture that he is conscious of the presence of the King and his chamberlain be bind the arras. The advice to the players [ was given sitting, with a friendly ease and dignity befitting the occasion In the badinage with Polonius, just before the play scene, when the Lord Chamberlain says in regard to his own stage triumphs " Brutus killed me, and Hamlet rejoins "It was a brute paraffin," before finishing the sentence with to kill so capital a calf there," Mr Harkins turned his back and walked away, so that no car was wounded by the coarse sarcasm To address such a phrase to Polonius within the hearing of the assembled court and most actors of the part do it-is to forget that Hamlet was likely to be governed in such a matter by delicacy of feeling The denouement of " The Murder of Gen sago was very effectively worked out Hamlet watches the King's face creeping up under the cover of a fan, exhibiting a painfully intense excitement the while, and when the criminal flies in dismay ho bursts into the hilarious quatrain, " AY by, let the stricken deer go weep,' with hearty exultation at the success of his plan, but without undue bois terouBneas, and sinks exhausted from mental tension into the King a chair, being now the sole occupant of the lately crowded room, where he is presently joined by Horatio in the operatic version of " Hamlet " there is a piece of business introduced in this scene which has lil ways seemed to us to be come mendable When the commotion arises and the courtiers are rushing about in terror, wondering what is going to happen next, the under servants, alarmed by the noise, crowd in, and the manager of the strolling players, who are the innocent cause of the disturbance, advances to the front of his little stage protesting in the utmost distress that his performers have meant no harm. This is a much more natural termination to the scene than the instant clearance of the chamber, Mr. Harkins omits the incident in which Hamlet, seeing the King at prayer, reason with himself as to whether he shall kill him there, and determines that his sword shall know a more " horrid bent " The scene IS fiendish and repulse o, and is wildly excited. In the closet scene, where Hamlet plunges his sword into the arms, killing the hidden courtier, and replies, in answer to the Queen's question as to who is the victim, " I know not, in it the King?' the best point of the evening was made. The words were uttered with an electrically thrilling effect, which made one wonder why Mr. Harkins should conceal so useful a reserve of force. The interview with the Queen mother was the least admirable portion of the performance. The words of dignified reproach put into the mouth of Hamlet, expressing so much nobility of character and tender pathos, clothed in language of the most exquisite grace and sweetness, were partly delivered in a high, thin tone, somewhat querulous, and suggestive of the lachrymose and whirring This is Mr, Barking's worst manner ism. It shows itself at times, and is very unattractive The tragedy ends with the death of the King and of Hamlet. Mr Harkins is skilful with the foils and he enacted the killing of the King with a momentary fire, which had only gleamed once before during the progress of the play. He nevertheless made a favourable impression on the audience, and was called before the curtain at the end of each act To sum up the performance of Saturday night, this is not a picturesque " Hamlet ' It does not take captive the imagination or eacham the feelings It is deficient in the, vigour, and impulse The highly sensitive, passionate nature of the Prince of Denmark is not depicted with sufficient emotional tension to enthral and none of the tumultuous overpowering effects which are capable of being produced with the character are ever i reached On the other hand, the impersona- | tion is entirely free from stagings of exaggeration. , the soliloquies are giv- en clearly I and naturally, and with just emphasis, and Mr Harkins has always remembered that Hamlet should be more a gentleman than an actor The representation is well calculated to awaken fresh interest in this tragedy and to send us with a new zest to the study of the great master The general cast of the tragedy was the same as on the occasion of its production a few weeks ago, with the exception that Mr Greville re appeared OB the First Gravedigger, a part to which he has an excellent prescrip- two right "Hamlet will be repeated to night ___________
