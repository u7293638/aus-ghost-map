ANGLING. ANGLING AS IT IS. Br PIKE. Not a bite! No, not even the ghost of a nibble! Fire times have I esaayed, and as many timet bare I failed in my endeavour to give to my basket a fishy smell. It iB still, I am sorry to say, as sweet as a nut. Naught but ahrimpa and aandworma have tarnished its virgin purity. This I look upon as a sort of calamity at this season of the year. The time was, and that not so far distant, when by the of November Master Bream and I have been on the most intimate terms j but that was before the advent of night-lines* I think of those curses by day and dream of them by night, and I am «qually unhappy in both states. I have gone down to the river in a mfrst Chris tian frame of' mind, with goodwill to all men, and all that sort of thing; but I am eorry to ray that my wishes have towards a small section of the Footacray community undergone b radic&l; change on my return journey, and I don't think that it is to be wondered at. Just imagineyour self in my fishing-boots for a minute or so, and I will try to explain the cause of the change. Z stick to business like bricks for a week, and then I promise myself half ft day'e relaxation on the river. I picture to myself that celebrated bole wbere I have so often filled my basket in an afternoon, and. start, happy and full of hope. After trsvellingnnder a hot sun for miles, over a rather stiffish country, I find, on arriving at said hole, that I. have been forestalled-not by ai brother angler, dear reader, but by a very frowsy individual in a " dug-out," who is trailing his machine by his long line, taking « fish off here, andputtinga bait on there, just by way of variety. And so good-night to my chance of any sport. Now., to imagine that any commonly-oOoatituted piece; of humanity could ait down and conscientiously say that be wished that man well, I believe* to be all fudge. 1 wished him as well as I could under the ciroumstances, and that was that his lines and his dingy were at the bottom of Hobson'a Bay, and that he was engaged in a more lucrative employment. And this vexation is of every-day occur rence. It was only about a week ago that I was sored so i but being determined to try a cast or two, I was rigging up my rod, when the parson in the boat bad the oool imperti nence to tell me that I had better not fish there, tor I would very likely get foul of his line. Jfra«*le8J! WMn'tlfan^l -Not withstanding this kindly faint, I fished there for veiy epite, and actually tried hard to get bold of bis line, and if I - bad I was deter mined to t*y the strength-of a very good Sainton gut bottom. But I might just 'as ^rell have fished in the bath' at home; I' would bave caught as many fish, and beep much nearer the beer-barreL The j#ry last, time that I was out I counted five of those human cormorants iflyi^^e^msfiiiow avoiation' within the distWPe of three quarters of a mile.
