Divorce Oase, and Ghost Trouble. To THE EDITOB. Sir,-ID your issue of the 27th, a Lower Portland correspondent writes of a divorce case in this district that is to be heard in the Divorce Court next month. It seems rather strange that the writer is the only one in this district who knows anything of it. It seems to nie that he knows more about other people's busi- ness than his own. Thar« is an old; saying that when one has no business of, his own, he delights in prying into other people's and it seems to be so in this ease. The ghost at Lower Portland, by the way» has been capturad. This will be a great relief to the young men who have been so-soared. To the great surprise of all, the ghoBt turned out to be an over-grown monkey* and he is now consigned to a well-known agent in Sydney. Yours, &cM; A BIVSR RESIDENT.
