MARJORIE'S LAST CHANCE. It was a yellow September day upon which we ail moved into the old house at Bubhleton-one of those days that lend a glamour to tbe saddest scene, and positively idealise the glories of our American autumns. The hillB were veiled iii soft violet haze,-the road was carpeted with red and yellow leaves-tbe bland sunshine steeped everything in warmth and brightness, and, out in the old fashioned garden, the pears hiing like pendants of gold, and the blue plums rained down on the 'ground whenever a light ' breeze shook the boughs, while the air Was full of the pleasant scent of the ripen- ' ing grapes. How we four girls raced tip and down under the trellised arbours 1-r-how we pelted each other with t h e heavy headed dahlias and «baséfl one another down to the very edpWÎfiè îïti'leliroofc that gurgled ; over , ¡ti bed of mossy stones/ and lashed a shrill answer io the angryr *h«1e'r of the discomfited r squirrels;, . whose ¿tore «if mite we .stole'! AwoV then the house ~-the ", bijf1 solitary: loom«: the quaint thtee%oornered «loBétó/theold-íaBbionedWBinsbotinít, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ around a fire of blazing stiske ia thc great chimney of the room which w« decided must have been the * best parlour* of the dead-aud-gone gentry, who had once inhabited Bubbleton Grange. * I mean to write a piece of poetrt about the broken sun-dial in the flower garden/ said Nina, sentiment- ally. ' I wonder which room would have the best light for my easel/ mused Helen, the artist of the family. 4 But you must remember, girls I' said I, hugging my knees and staring ecstatically into the fire, * that if il hadn't been for me, you would never, any of you, have crossed the threshold of Bubbletoh Grange!* * I thiuk/ said Sara, sarcastically, ' that we must vote Marjorie a medal as the philanthropist of the family/' * We must bear in mind/ observed Nina, aptly following Sara's lead, * that, if it hadn't been for the charm* ing stupidity of our younger sister, who would neither be à scholar, s shop-girl, nor an artist, aunt Pauline never would hare brought us tc Bubbleton.' 'Exactly/ said I, not in the leas! discomfited by this sisterly raillery, tc which I was accustomed. ' But do you think, Marjorie/ said gentle Helen, * that you can manage the bees?' 'With a netting mask and'gloves yes/ said I. ' I mean, to make a profit out ol the business/ explained Helen. ' Oh, I don't know/ said I. *I never made a prout out of anything yet. But bee-culture is full ot possi- bilities; at least so the Manual says. And there are four or five rows dowu at the foot of the garden with at-least a dozen hives ia every row. Suppose each hive to net twenty-five shillings a season-* 'Oh, Marjorie, Marjorie 1' cried Helen, elevating her hands in dispair, * that isn't the way to calculate Y ' Isn't it ? Well, don't let us calcul- ate to night!' said I, with a yawn. * We are all too tired-and this fire- light is too glorious. Hark ! isn't that a cricket on the hearth ? The dear little harbinger of good, how pleasant its tiny voice sounds ! Ob, I am ewe we are going to succeed !' To explain things properly to the reader, I must first acknowledge that Sara's estimate of me was perfectly correct. Practically speaking, I was a failure. I had broken hopelessly down in my examination to become a school- teacher-I had bungled in the very rudiments of art-I was too poor a mathematician to reckon change behind a counter. Even when they Compromised matters by making me a companion to an old lady who was willing to nay a moderate salary to someone wno suited her, I spoiled all by falling asleep when 1 was reading to ber, and forgetting the daily bath i of her darling poodle. And when aunt Pauline read in the newspapers i an advertisement of a bee-farm to let, she grasped the opportunity. * I will start Marjorie in bee culture/ Baid she ; * and if she can't succeed in that, she can't succeed in anything, and weean all live out in the country a deal cheaper than we can in tho city. Sara and Nina can come into the city every day to give their lessons*-Helen can have a studio somewhere in the house, and prosecute her art-work; and Marjorie, poor unlucky child, ' shall have one last chance.' And this was bow and why we came to Bubbleton Grange 1 * Do you suppose/ said I, refloating. ; after we had listened to the cricket's | chirp in silence for some time, ' that there is a*-- ghost at the Grange ?' ' Sara gave a violent start. * What nonsense !' said she. ** It would make it very romantic/ i said soft-voiced Nina. I * I haven't heard of a ghost/ said Helen, 1 bat I've heard of a very ' elegant gentleman who has his country ?seati itt Aüs¿ey Parir,- «lose to otfr bdUnflaries-Mt. fSer^ld iAtistëy T v 1 » tolihgT said Kimi- eagerly. ' * Yes/ nodded Helen. -g A^éss-tlíoä old Micha?!, tW^rdénet-, says. And should like a wealthy husband as we as any girl. I detest this crying < hammer time and tune into the hea of every stupid child whose motbc can afford to pay me three guineas quarter !' 'Don't leave me «out, girls!' sai Helen. As for me, I still sat and stared int the fire, clasping my knees close than ever. I was the youngest-th ugly duck-the stupid one of th family. Naturally I expected t J giv place to my eldest s sters!-a sort c unwilling Cinderella 2 * And what does Marjorie say 1 asked Nina, laughing-and Sar answered ' Nothing at all 1 Marjorie, poo dear, never has any ideas I' But they were mistaken-I ha. ideas. I had a very defínate intentioi of making a success of the bee-busi neBs, I was tired of alternate Iee tur and ridicule. I resolved that this tim' I would triumph over my adverse fate And all this time I was musing ove my future. * I may have ideas,' I sharp!1 retorted, * but they don't run in th direction of love and love-making. And just then AuntPauline caine ii and sent us all, without ceremony o distinction, to bed. Very early in the morning I wok' up, roused by the cheerful crowinj of some not far distant chanticleer and the myriad indescribable sounds o country life, and without disturbing Helen, who still slept soundly, 1 ros and dressed myself and stole softlj out into the garden, where the erina son of dawn-rise was clothing even tb« simplest surroundings with pic- turesque glory. Surly asl was, my little wi»ge< charges had been before me, and wen soaring forth in tiny clouds of black ness towards the level morning sun shine. I walked up and down thi narrow, thyme bordered path, anc viewed the industrious mites witl mingled admiration and disgust. ' They must love to work bettei than I do,' was the Upshot of my meditations. ' Horrid, fussy little things. What have they done to deserve being held up to all creation at a model ?' And then I began, Alcaschar-like, to count up the possibilities of making a fortune within the next ten years out of these bee-hives. Supposing that j all went prosperously-supposing that ' honey held its own in the market j supposing that each swarm duplicated itself half-a-dozen times over-sup I posing Butin my abstracted saunter up 1 and down the narrow pathway I lost I sight of outward surroundings and I Unconsciously stepped backward, over- turning two or three hives at once. I uut flew the enraged inhabitants of j these invaded cities armed cap-a-pve I -away flew I pell-mell and screaming * help Î help ;' into the very arms of a man with a gun in his hand who sprang over the store wall, appearing ! as if by magic before my astonished \ vision. Apparently he comprehended i the whole in a second, and seizing me around the waist be swung me lightly [ over the wail into a small circular summerhouse, over-grown with scarlet I leaved ampélopsis and late-blôBsomed honeysuckle. ! ' We are safe here/ said he. They will go past us. Bees are stupid creatures. I hope you are not hurt?' ' No/ cried T, laughing and crying at the same moment, * but £ hope you weren't hurt; fori ran against you with my whole force ?' "* Not in the least/ he answered courteously. ' X suppose you are one of my new neighbours ?' * I am Marjorie Bell/ said I, think- ing with a pang of my crimping pms and the extreme plaiuness of my ging ham grown 1 . .k And Ï am Gerald Anstey/ he said. * I boee that hereafter we shall be the best of friends, Miss Marjorie I Will yoltt allow me to go back, now that the ' bees are quieted doWo a little, and re^ place fteluWo^ tb* temtö? :HWr^wmmMjt do be careful!' :!r, ' ' : \ :T :>!:< . ' ; ; I ^Âalîn^;wtth my heart riptfjT with me as far as the door-step of the old Grange, and left me, promising to call that very afternoon 1 In this unconventional way our friendship commenced-and when the first snow fell, feathery»«bite and soft over the hills and vales, Gerald Anstey asked me to be bis wife ! ' Little Marjorie has drawn the trump card after all,* said aunt Pauline, laughing. * Oh, Marjorie, may I come up to the Hall, when you are married,' said Helen, * and copy those beautiful old pictures in tho library,?' I * Only to think,' said majestic Sara, ' that a man could fall in love with a I wild romp of a girl who nearly knocked him do.vn at their first meeting !' I ' Perhaps/ B&id; Nina, putting a caressing hand on my head, ' it is because Marjorie bas a face like a , cherub, and the sweetest blue eyes in all the' world ? After all, I don't I know that I wonder at Mr. Austey so very much/ And so the bees made my fortune after all, although not exactly in the way we had anticipated !
