Sir—A sum ought to be put on the estimates for the expense of printing a large number of copies of his Excellency's speech on the opening of the Legislative Council, to he distributed amongst the schools in the province, as an instance of ngram-u matical language, to he avoided, I observe that his Excellency desires simp7er forms of law—Docs he mean more simple forms ?> I notice also that he asks whether the concessions of her Majesty to the province are to be azailcd of. Does he mean whether the province will avail itself of them ? I am, Sir, your obedient, servant, COBBETT'S GHOST.
