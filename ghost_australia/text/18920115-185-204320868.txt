SNAZELLE. Mr Snazelle gave a change of programme at the Mechanics’ Institute [?] evening. There was a good audience, and the enter tainment was thoroughly enjoyed by every- one. Among the features of the programme was the reading of Tennyson’s touching poem, “Enoch Arden,” which was given in a masterly manner and was rendered more effective by the admirable illustrations which accompanied it. A number of Scottish views were very interesting, especially a scries illustrating Burns’ “Cotter’s Saturday night." Mr Snaz»lle sang “ Reeked in the cradle of the deep" most effectively, and was loudly applauded. Among other noticeable items of the performance was “The garden scene from ‘ Faust,' " in which Marguerite and Mephistopheles were made to appear and disappear from the scene. Mr Snazelle rendered the well known serenade in excellent fashion, and again drew forth the plaudits of his listeners, “ The cnkernutmaii’a story” was one of the hits of the evening, and was re ceived with signs of unbounded apprecia tion. To-night Mr Snazelle takes a benefit, and another change of programme will be given. “ The ookernutman’s story” will be retained, and among the fresh items to be given will be “ Mariey’s ghost ” (Dickens), illustrated by 20 scenes from living models.
