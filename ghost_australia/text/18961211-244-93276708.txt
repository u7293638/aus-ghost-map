A? RO?MANCE OF MAORI?LAND ?ri' flotnir.) ON TH WAIKATO. AT II`f41 ESTBUrA'Y CIHAPTEi')+ V.--CON It.uED. The cog stood watching me as I tried first the door antd then the win dow, to gain admittance. Going fur ther tound to antimglec of the Ibuilding, where there had- reccnt I been added an additional room, 1 diasuvcied that the small window therein )iclded to mty hand. It was what is known as a cqttage window and very small, but, after tmuch tribulation, I ilanaged to squeeze imy body through it and found myself in a room as dark as lades. I carefully groped about mnc, not wishing to give any needless alarm. 1 could distinctly hear some one snorinlg soundly, the noise being a good imnita tion of the lower notes of a French horn. (;Guided by the sounld, I laid lily hand on a plunil form slhubering peacefully oni a. stump bedstead. I shook the slumberer somewhat roughly. In an'instant the snoring ceased,giving place to a girl's voice, that called out in accents of alarm, but with an unmlis takablo not thernl ati, : " What tilhe dcl's that ?" I flush, my girl It's only-" " Wha are ye ?' she cried, sitting bolt upright and stretching forl h her arms. " Is it a ghaist that touched mle ? The L.ord save us and bless us I it's no canny to be haunted," she lmut tered, in a lower Lcy and with trembl ing lips. " I anll not a ghost,"' I returned, ill a reassuring tone. liave you matches' and candle handy ?" - "Matches ? What gars ye speak of matches? ''Tak yersel wa." II lily life had been it stake I could not have held in the hearty guffaw that escaped ime like a rifle crack at the tone of her voice and words. "Ah, it's a poor gate when anemneets auld Cloutie !" she cried, beginning to sob. " Blessed saints, save me (fom the unco wain !" My laughter rang out again and the Newfoundland began to bark. " My good woman, don't you hear that I amn only a man ?-a being of Ilesh and blood, like yourself?" I an swered, giving her another shake. " A mIan !" she ejaculated, int quite anothor tone of voice. 'Ilow dare you come in a decent lassie's roomt at this time of nicht ? How dare you do it?" " Listcen to tie for a minute." "I'll no listen to sic a foul carlie," she responded quickly. "Shame oll ye, moll, to conic sneaking tae one's roonm when all the rest o' the house are sleeping." "Confound it I Will you listen to me while I explain ?" " Gang awa wi ye the same way ye cam, or I'll rouse the captain," she cried, sharply, raising her voice to a higher pitch. " Conime, inaich, out ye go through the window." " Which is Captain Helywood's room ?" "Which ? AIh! ye would be at murder you villain?" she answered, fumbling for the candlestick. "My dear mnadamn, believe me I alIn "Don't fash youtsel'''llnon, with sweet words," rephed lmy invisible coln panion. " Keep your blarney to cool your IOlrridge. I'm noii your dear madaml, ye ugly loon ; and not to be bamboozled by fair blather. l)o ye think I don't ken ye. .Maister I)avie Brock? Although ye are trying to change your voice I ellen ye, llty lad u And what's mollre, I'll tell the caltpati what a false carle ye ate, if I live to -ec the morn !" The welcome greeting of a utatch struck my ear as she concluded and in stantly the rooml was illumlined. " \Why, you are no I)avie, aftcl a': " she cried, gazing at mny blood-stained face and torn habilimnents in allia.c Ilient. " Certainly not, I tcplied, gtavily. " If you had only t ondtscccndcd to listen to tile for a IIolicintI I wou il have explained Iny being lerit: att thi. hour." "Oh, youl would, ch ? \\\'ell. what do ye want ?" e)cing toe :,uspaI 9usly. t"have ail illmpotalstl COIImuitluiitatiott to mnake to Capltain Ileywood \without delay," "Gang to the hlut o' the imen i)ndet and see the Calt;tln ill the itOiniinig,' she said. " I 1mus see him at once." " Y 1ust F" " I IIUSt !" " Awecl, the.i, ang antd see himt; and, I say, have t!he Illtannes to cloc the window aftlr \e." A litave, Ictrany wenchi, tlhis, with a round, talt lact, hige, buinct c)c. and. anills as t oll2 adIll muscullar .s a vil lage blatksmith, it t, go into the wli delneiss in to ~titnerehip with isltme young anid halii) settler t) hew out taf the PIritilive ~haos a hotrie amid a tulnte for her irogeii'y. I objected to aialpe toy exit through the wildowl and begged ilthat she woulld awaken Captain lheywood, as liy in formiationt concierned the safety of thce statliol. SI canna go to the itnaister in Iny sark I' she cried, in somie conifusiotn. " Gang out atl 'le wiidow for Ijuslt two minutes and then l'll be tscady to do your bidding." I was out oif the window in a ctatk, and was shlt- tly aftetwards jotied by tlly tnaid, wt?ho without mote ado lud ile to round to a side door and ran ti bell, Presently a head was- thrust oit h with an old-bashined nightcap thircon, Stotn one of the windows. "What'a the matter ?" caled a voiae rescbling lhe sharp grating of a hand gaw on a nai - " Here's a Mnan wa.ts to lspealk wi )c, sir. I'articular u!;silcss." " Tell thile an to go to --- Jleri cho!" Iesponded the \ic te anlid the head and nightcap dis.ilppeaid; i Ilt in a Inoinmir nt a tall, thin liguIc emIlgei d llon10 d tl t in(eIlsI ill the vl e andah, clad scantily and healing in his hand a candle. I suggested that the maid sholld itc tire, as what I had to say was quitc confidential, wheruiponl tile c;lptain (for it was lhe) held the light above his head and took a critical stirvey of lily tout ens,'mb/e. " I'll take your figure head for your honesty, but, as for the rest of you, hang me, you secem lo have experi enced rough weather," he said coolly. " I'i an old sea dog and not to be bamboozled by humbug, Now, what d'ye want ?" I told miy errand in twenty words, but not before the girl had retired. " P'hw !" whistled the mariner ; " is the wind in that quarter ? Well, I'll contrive the dogs a warm reception when tlhey do come. How many did you say there were ?" "About fifty, Captain lHeywood, as near as I could calculate." " lumph I rather long odds. Never mnind, sir, conie in." I followed him through apairof fold. ing doors into a well-carpeted and lofty apartment, furnished most luxuriously. Iy the soft light of a costly bronze lamp which the captain lit, I saw that no vulgar taste had suggestLxl the fur. niture and belongings of this apart. ment. From the thick maroon cur tains to the soft. delicate-tinted ipaper on the walls, there was exquisite har. mony, blended with artistic design. Nothing loud or showy check by jowl with ract bric-a-bric here. I have known people with more money than taste make a fiuriture inart of their homes. Others, again, who had abundant taste and very little money, have managed to make home comfortable and even elegant. Tn this apartment there was wealth and cle. gance combined; and the effect was charming. 'The i'aptain, who appeared to be a hardy son of Neptune, verging op fifty. live and with a jolly, good- hurlored face, bade me be seated and requested me to give hitm a detailed accotnt of what I had seen and heard. Not satislicd with this, I had to give a per sonal account of myself as to how I became be-nighted in the Manaka hills on the \Vaikato. The equcest seemed reasonable and I gratified him, just touching so much of my history as merged into the ques. tion at issue. " And so your name is Frank Leigh, you say ?" " Yes; here is my card." " Card I" lie echoed in surprise;" do you carry cards ?" "Certainly, Captain Hleywood." "Of course; no offence, my lad." " Leigh-Leigh ?" he repeated to himself. "l.eigh? I know that name well enough. W\hat part of the old country do you hail frotm ?' "A little township called letley, in Lincolnshire," I replied, smiling. "The devil!" cried the captain, starting suddenly to his feet. "No, sir, 1 said Tetlcy," cried 1, laughing. "So you did, mny lad. Why, hang me, I was born within three miles of it," ejaculated the old fellow, with much energy. " I knew a Coloncl, l.cigh who lost- an arn at the battle of' Waterloo. I le lived in an old tumbled down ruin called 'The Pillars,' about half-a.mile out of ctley." "The colonel was my grandfather, Captain Heywood. I was born-' like my father before me-at 'The Pil lars.'" " You don't say so! Give me your till, ly boy. ang tile, I'm glad to mcct youl," he cried, with genuitne plea sure beaming f iom his eyes. " iordt love you, I've stotl Illany .1 ton oi t appll'li out of the old colonel's gaidnci when I wa., a younker.

Vet the picture here rcversed this order of things. 'fake the features singly, and they were Iby no neantis perfect, nor were they set off by any brilliancy of coloring. iut the face aroused and impressed the imnagina. tion with a belief in the purity and lov. liness of virgin woman--womnn tun. tempted and unntainted, either by the follices or the vices of that m)ystery called society. The glossy raven hair, coiled up in a simple, luxuriant knob behind the small cars, together with the pale olive complexion, were cer tainly not , nglish ; but the (lark blue, lustrous eyes, slhadedl by long lashes, the sweet, expressive mlouthl, and the sooth white broiw, were unimistak anble c.haracteristics of the Anglo-Saxon ra(e.
