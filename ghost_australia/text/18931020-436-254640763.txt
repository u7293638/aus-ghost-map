A NEW COMET. The Rev. George Martin write* to the Herald:â€”" Iu observing the planet Venus on 12 h test., just after sunset with a 4m. Grubb equatorial, I was surprised to find a comet in the same telecopic field with the planet. I thought at first that it must be a ghost,or some flaw in the glass ; but on turning the telescope on to the double star Antares, I found things all right and the little companion to the star quite distinct. Oi re-observing the planet with various powers the comet was a fine oVject. In relation to the planet the nucleus was south, following, and tbe tail spread out in a fan-like curve, in part enveloping the planet hut in no wi*e detracting from its brilliancy. For a few moments to tbe naked eye the planet was involved in a distinct uebuloaity, though no clouds were in the sky near the planet."
