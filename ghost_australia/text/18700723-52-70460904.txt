THE BOGAN. July 5th. This day (July 5th) four months it began to rain hero; ever since we have been more or less subject to doods. The Bogan is now falling, and will I dare say be crossable for teams in the course of a few days. Tho water is fast drying up on the plains, as from their very level nature the water cannot drain off, and must either evaporate or absorb. What a country for a railway ! At "Buddabuddah" (oh, what a name ! it took two of us to spell it) the new public-house is pro- gressing very slowly, and instead of being opened on. the first, as was intended, the foundation and posts are only to be seen. All was flooded. There wns only ono dry spot on tho Bogan that I know of, and that was near Ryan's house, although the house itself was nearly covered. Mr. Balfe had to quit his house, although ho thought (poor man !) that he had it built out of the reach of lloodB. At Dandaloo, Mr. Martell had to fly in the dead of night to the sand ridges, and all his stores and furniture were more or less injured. Some of the most valuable furniture was raised on benches ; but, how- ever, the water did not remain long so high, as it began to subside after the second day. Our mailman is seriously ill, I believe, from being so long exposed to the wet. Tho continual wet and boggy state of tho country has left the cattle and sheep in a very low condition. Still Mr. Brown's lambing at Mulla Mulláis progressing very favourably. Mr. John M'Nevin's sheep on tho Myall Cowell are doing very well, being high and dry. The report so falsely raised of that enterprising gentle- man's death by drowning is, I am happy to say, most flatly contradicted by him putting in anything but a ghost-like appearance at Cardington. The squatters are once more busy, and drafting and branding goes on even on tho Sabbath, as if a flood or any other visitation of Providence never visited the Bogan.
