If in a Beethoven scherzo he is unable to follow the time with his forefinger in the score, after the greatest effort, it is well to condemn the tempo is too last. There are many of his readers who are sure to have a- been in the same predicament, and will sympathise. About waltz time would be better, and enable them comfortably to turn back to the repeals.

It the time he played in octaves by the violins and doubled with a cornet or such like the work is melodious. Otherwise it is best to watch the orchestra, and if everyone seems to be doing something it can be termed learned and scholastic esp emily if the critic be musician enough to detect a bit of again writing But the critic will, I fear, complain that I am helping him how to I v rite rather than listen. s eli, he goes to write, not to listen. Could he listen he would not virile " But my time draws to an end, and I must leave the amateur m alibis multitudinous forms to another occasion, and conclude with a suggestion as to how a military should listen to music Let him find ntitBomc turns before what is to be played, and if possible study it carefully. Let the themes be all familiar to his mind, and let him form a conception for himself of how they should be phriisul-that is to say, where the accents should fall, where the unrest and diminuendo made, what the true tempo of each one ia. For even theme bus its own tempo, only ascertainable to the musician by lengthily and similarity. Indent, ii theme, before one is fit to perform it or entitles its Coi formance, should so to speak, have been a part of oneself, it should start up in one's mind at odd times and places, when one is scarcely conscious for the tune what it is.

This is the one and sole aim of the listener, to follow the subtle ever changing moods of the music, without effort, and with out thought, surrendering himself entirely to the air claiming, all saving melody as it at a came while,', nervous and passion ful, telling the secret history of the heart, dis closing us it ville the mainsprings of existence , giving us to participate in those under current of feeling which we recognise outwardly us temperament, character, trout which all actions spring, and that since of actions which we term human life; and of which it is the peculiar province of the musical art to lay before us the fundamental principle in logical sequence, leaving us to tell that line there me no questions to be leaked, no problems to be solved We are individually for the moment that which the essence of all being uni! doing in " I confess that I listen to music more reads) in the evening. to walk in the cool dusk to the concert hall, when Night, the twin sister of At e, htshicalhid love him as over all things out of staring villa and garden building beautiful old turreted castles , from ofhiiHiw piles of refuse, with which the people of this town love to cover what few spots of nature are left creating a thousand luiitiisticbhiulou) turns , transforming Hill laden lighters to make bulges, gliding into sight from an, unknown worlds, into vanishing again in mist, was) enchantment swallowing up this half Imishtd, uncouth town with its gaunt, ungainly parts of bricks and article and in its stead making to up use seemingly as From out some old commence, a interesting city of state!) proportions, whose tall spires quiver in the sunlight, along whose shadow) streets dun pint foulis noiselessly) come and go Aje, even lack Robinson, whom to avoid in distance one would glad!) walk a quarter mile out of one's way, is now a weird in- offensive ghost, no more niliatiintuil than the shadows that in) silence) and silence) i (iignlpiihini In ought art, to, the passions I engi'iiiliie'd li) the line!) conflict of his subside to a profound tenderness All that is harsh and discordant n solus into gentleness and pi nee Unheard Melodies lost in the quiet man and fill the soul with joy and consolation 1 Here will we sit, mill let the rounds of music deep In our case halt stillness and the flight Became him touche I am much turmoils look how the laborer living ends this kind and with it allies of Mile-End cold Time's not the in illertorliuhk.il thou l>elialcl't,c Hut in his mouth like an angel which Mill airliner to all women excel elieilillias, Snell nutritious It is dinnertime soul?
