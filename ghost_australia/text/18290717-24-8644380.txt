"We have great satisfaction in our Journal of this week of .presenting onr'readers with the King's Speech at the opening 'Of the Session of the Imperial Parliament for the present Tear. It will be found perhaps to be the most important State Paper, as it certainly is the most interesting, which has appeared for many years, and it has the singular effect ot spuing unanimity in the British Cabinet apon a great domes- tic! question, and more -singular still of attaching the great leaders of the Opposition to the Minister. This Speech has travelled ,ont of the beaten track, and it exhibits a more Statesman-like expose than any document issued on a like occasion in the memory of man. It com- mences with the usual assurance of peace from Foreign Powers, and states that under the mediation of England, ¿peace has been concluded between Brazils and Rio de la Plata, and the adjustments the claims of British subjects upon Spain, air which bare been effected without bloodshed. His Majesty has opened a. negotiation with tbe Head of the ' House of Braganza, to settle the 'differences with Portugal. The troops of His Most Christian Majesty havecómmencea_ their return from Greece, having completed the restoration dr that country tq Peace, io conjunction with .their Allies. . His; Majesty deplores. the continuance of the war between Russia and the Porte, and' thei 'blrickáde of" the Dardanelles.' His - Majesty announces the!rimprovement of the Revenue! and the economy which he is anxious to enforce in every deparlmeiit of the State. His 'Majesty then adverts to the slate of Ire- land, and; calls, for. powflrs io enable,him ; to .preserve.his just' . .authority,' by suppressing ' an Association existing there, which keeps alive discord, and obstructs the improvement of the country ; and when that is accomplished,. he ' recommends. them to renew the Laws which impose Civil disabilities on the Catholics.. The Duke of WELLINGTON stated that a' Hill .would be iniroducéd,'to'remove the Civil disabilities of tbe eatHdlics.'atíd'thíit it would be acconípaijicü with other, measures rendered necessary thereby. -It will !be"Iseen by, our Parliamentary Report, that thdi Earl AfjWiNCHÎELSEX and Iflrd.lÍL.itoti. still oppose any concessions ; but that Sir Jf.

I take the liberty of requesting that you will communicate this letter to those leading Members of the University with whom you may think proper to confer, and that you will con- sult with them as to the period at which it will be most con- venient to the University that my seat in Parliament should be vacated. I will be guided by the suggestions with which you may favour me in this respect, in making my application to the Crown for some nominal appointment, which may vacate my seat. By this painful sacrifice—by the forfeiture of that high dis- tinction which I have prized much more than any other object of my ambition—I shall, at least, give a decisive proof that I have not taken my present course without the most mature deliberation, and that I have not suffered myself to be influ- enced by any other motive than that of overpowering sense of public duty. My present relation to the University will be terminated, but, believe me, that, to the latest hour of my existence, I shall never be unmindful of the confidence with which I have been honored, and the kindness and indulgence which I have experienced, and that I shall study to maintain, with unabated zeal, the privileges and interests of the University and of the Church of England, notwithstanding the dissolution of those ties which have more immediately bound me to their service, —I have the honor to be, my dear Sir, with every sentiment of respect and regard, your most faithful servant, ROBERT PEEL. We cannot pass over this important letter without offering some comments on it. This letter is candid and manly. Mr. PEEL states his firm belief, that even his continued opposi- tion would not only be unavailing to prevent Catholic Eman- cipation, but would be injurious to the general interest of the Empire. He however tells us, in plain English, that it was his resistance to that Question that mainly contributed to secure him the support of his Constituents. We would not be by any means surprised, if these most conscientious voters would now turn round like their Representative, and follow the loaves and fishes—nay, outstrip PEEL and DAWSON in liberality, for those good men generally keep a sharp look out for fat livings and bishopricks, and knowing that all Church dignities center in the Crown—or practically in the Prime Minister, we are inclined to think those worthies will be all cap in hand to His Grace the Duke of Wellington, all ob- sequiousness, like the lank figure in the Hermit of Van Die- men's Land; ready at a call, no matter with what indignity their opinions may be treated. It would not surprise us even to find the London Courier become quite liberal, the Court air having a wonderful effect upon the principles of courtiers. It is not a little singular that the great struggle of the liberals in France is to keep the Jesuits out of power, and the great struggle in England is to make the Churchmen divide some of their exclusive political monopoly; both these circumstances only confirm us in our opinion, that no greater evil can befal a country than political Churchmen and a wealthy Church —both are unscriptural, and all history proves that they give a death blow to liberty wherever they are suffered to exist. So soon as Churchmen (no mutter of what creed—all are alike in that respect) meddle with politics, they lose their moral in- fluence over their flocks, and their preaching has no effect. We therefore unhesitatingly say, the more they are abstracted from worldly cares, and confined within their own proper sphere, the more can they attend to their sacred calling, and fulfil the duties of their Ministry, according to the commands of that Gospel which teaches poverty to them, and not to med- dle with those that are given to changes. The Catholic Question, at this moment occupying the chief attention of the Imperial Parliament, we feel it our duty to give our readers the fullest information in our power upon this subject, no other political transactions in Great Britain being of equal magnitude with it. For this purpose we lay before our readers the substance of the proceedings and speeches at the Catholic Association in Dublin on a late occasion, which we conceive will be found very interesting to our readers. They are as follows:— DUBLIN, JANUARY 24, 1829. The business of the co-operation between the most influen- tial persons of the Protestant and Catholic body is still in progress. The Sub-committee is actively engaged in the work, and individually there appears to be the greatest desire to consummate this important national benefit. The Noblemen and Gentlemen who composed the Commit- tee for conducting the arrangements of Lord MORPETH'S dinner, and those who arranged the late Meeting at the Ro- tunda, together with the movers and seconders of all the Re- solutions adopted thereat, form a body of between one and two hundred persons, who have appointed a Sub-Çommittee of twenty Protestants and the same number of Catholiss, now sitting to arrange the details of the proposed junction. The following are extracts of speeches delivered at the Association:— Lord KILLEAN, the eldest son of the Earl of FINGALL, in handing in the Catholic Rent of his parish, said it was not the amount of the subscription, but the general payment, making every man in his own circle a Patriot, which gave to the Catholic Rent an impetus. He paid the Catholic Rent himself, because he was convinced it was the great means of furthering the measure they were united to advance; it was, be- sides, the link which bound the Gentry and the Peasantry to- gether, and gave to the latter the high notions of patriotism and independence, which abstracted them from secret associa- tions and illegal combinations, and though he never would force any one, he always used his influence as mildly as he could, to promote the collection of Rent. His Lordship then read the census of his parish (County of Meath), as fol- lows:—Catholics 4361, Protestants and Dissenters 180— total 4541. In this parish the most perfect peace existed, and the greatest cordiality between Catholics and Protestants, notwithstanding that the few Protestants possessed all the po- litical power and patronage of the Parish, and could levy any amount they pleased upon their Catholic neighbours, in the shape of Church rates. It has been observed lately, that the situation of Ireland is so desperate that it is the duty of every man who loves his country, whether he be Protestant, Catholic, or Dissenter, to throw himself into the breach, and take a part in the struggle now making for the establishment of religious peace. I do sincerely hope that the union about to be formed between the sects will be permanent, and if no superstructure shall be raised on that foundation, I think the fault will not be with the Catholics. I know the dispositions of those who take an active part in these Councils. I know that they are ready to make large sacrifices, and they have a right to expect that the Protestants also should make considerable allowances—we have arrived at that important crisis. We have been depri- ved of our impartial and uptight Viceroy, who was favourable to our claims, and it appears by the newspapers of this day, that we are about to get a new Lord Lieutenant with different political opinions. Although we must deeply regret the change, still it should be borne in mind, that some Viceroys who came here with unfavourable impressions, left us decided friends; and let us hope this will be the case with the Duke of NORTHUMBERLAND. At all events it is our duty to pur- sue our course with firmness, temperance, but above all with uncompromising determination, adopting the excellent advise given by the talented and patriotic Lord MORPETH, to endea- vour to conquer reluctant Protestantism by a display of Catho- lic virtue. And I trust, indeed I am confident, that the liberal protestant Noblemen and Gentlemen who have recent- ly come forward, will not be satisfied with a day of parade, of an ephemeral exhibition, but that they will exert them- selves strenuously for the satisfactory settlement of a ques- tion, in which the interests of this country are so deeply in- volved; and that those of them who are in Parliament will withhold their support from any Administration, no matter how constituted, that will not take into consideration the state of Ireland, with a view to the removal of its political evils. Mr. SHEILL, talking of the Earl of SHREWSBURY, said, I lament his absence at Rome at such a crisis as the present. His great rank Premier Earl of England, and his enormous fortune give him opportunities of advancing the question.— His very presence, the sight of the descendant of the great TALBOT, demanding admission at the doors of the House of Lords into that chamber where his hereditary seat is left va- cant, would be imposing. What might not he and the great Catholic Aristocracy of England effect, if they were to apply a p«rtiop-of ^eiiTasí Qpjjtîenca^ iii the'^jcjiasp. of places in parliament?1 n > «n ) . » « / '.j \f i 'I ' ^r.W^said, tj.e Protestant,mina joins, oars, .and,will ke the contest national, n« fee! more strongly, than, tbpjj Sbnt,wB«? m,^J,HjS&W;* ftMTthwto^eh, toataMr^M"^'. o""",w'«,'B «.' they, feel thir.sjTn.

Tlje learned Gentlema^ tb^en ran over the átatutess about the oaths which werç necessaty to be taken on entering Parliament, and insisted, on,bis right by law to'tnke his seat in fl\e Imperial Parliament. Hp'con- trasted the 22d aitiçle of the Union with Scotland, which was ?erj full as to.tlie taking of the oaths, anil the .penalties and disabilities for refusing Uptake the same'witiy the 4lh'nrticlt> of the lush Un jon, which, after reciting the first balfdopei| lin/>s of th}s22d, a»ti» le, sfops short, and proceed^ no further, because (said Mr.' 0'Connlll)^ Mr. Pitt * meditated ad mitting the Catliolics into Parliament the next Session, am} when he cou|d not oveicome the scruples and prejudices of the late King, he resigned. He adverted to two Statutes, one of l'Jiisabeth, and one of James I. directing that an oath' s'ioultf be taken,' acknowledging the King 01 Queen as head ot the Church, This was an oath which not a single Protest t iu the »eign of William and Mary, to emancipate the Dissenr ters. But it might be said, thot, for «bat oath was subslir tuted the 30lh Charles H. ; if it were .done so, it was withouf this authority of law, and for the purpose of putting fees intp the pockets of the Clerks, which law Lord Col cm si Lil must know was abolished, and it shew ed want, of candour to bring it forrard now. When he went into the House, he would most willingly take the oath as to property-would it then be required from, lum to take the oath required by the Act of Challas Ii. which was passed during the ferment created m England by Titus Oates ? The scene that then passed in England was most disgraceful to that country, where perr jursd Judges and Junes were found to halloo on the wretch on the table, to the destruction of the victim, at the bar < hear and cheers). On his going to England, hestrusted that bj proving there wah no necessity foi taking; the abominably oiths^he would be able to assist the Catholic Peers of that country ; for, if it was his right to sit ¡u the House of Com'- . mons, theirs to take their place in the House of Lords must be immediately conceded. Thus would1 he he enabled to stive the noblest Peerage in,the world, and at the same time to do justice lo the religion and liberties of the people of lie- j lind (loud cheers). Lord Coi CHLSiER, in Ins pielace, cited .» number of cases that had occurred attei the Scotch Union, I mid before the Union with Ireland. He, Mr.O'CoNNElL,] . admitted all tbese, and the introduction of them by Lord Coi cfiEsTrn could bo but for the pmposes of delusion. The piesent LordiFi\G\i I was a living witnebs that Mr. Pitt | »>iidiLordtCASlLhRrA«H intended to emancipate the Catho- lics ; he'had seen the letter ot Lord Collat ai.lis. The Knight of Kerry was ii witness to this, and w.as ready" to swear to it, and Loi ti Rossmore had communicated, to the PjIiIic the facts with which he was( acquainted with îespect to (he taking of the oaths. It was the same in, the Irish as the Scotch Act, but the lush Act stopped ¡short, ivhije the Scotch Act went on to nfliv the penalties lor refusing to take the oaths ; it mentioned them plainly-£500 ioi any vate or inca- pacity to sei ve the Crown in any ollice, and a forfeiture ol the «eat 1 he Ii tsh Union Act left out e\ ery one of them, and ¡tn^oiuts no one to administer «hebe oaths ; it might be saul they were1 lo \ie adminibtercd by the House of Commons. He «femes that, for they had no such, power ; except where it was expressly given them by the Sltitute-they could not evamuie | witnesses on oath ; if they wanted lo,administer an oath to Lim, he should require thciu to show tbe Statute, and. call to j any Lawyer to to administer an oath to the Member for Clare. The Irish Art ol Union did not deolare that there wvas to be any forl'ei-1 ture, pam, oripcnalty whatsoe\er for not taking the oaths.- I Could there be any Law] er so degraded as to say that a Bli- , tish subject Mas liable to pains, penalty, or forfeiture by im- plication, without a posit tie enactment? So though there i was a direction to take the oath, there was appointed no tri - bunal to'adiiiiiu'ster it, or any penalty for not tukmg it. Tlu$ proved, the intentions of Mr. Pitt, as declared in his letter ol 1801, when he resigned because he could not be allowed to c irry thal question. He (Mr. O'CONNELL) understood that the present Speaker intended to rely on the 4lsJ. of Geo, lill Hi> hoped such was his uiteution, for he would be able to prove that that Statute did not apply at all to the case, I{ fthould be observed, that Lord CoLCiinsiiR did not rely upon this Act, he was not so absurd as to rely upon it-it applied «»(y to Revenue Officers. By the Irish Act, the oathi should be taken before the Irish Speaker, before forty Mem- bers of Hie Iris!) House of Commons, and between the hours ?of 11 and 4 o'clock. In order to be qualified under this Actj they should conjure-up the Ghost of Lord ORIEL, strip linn or bis Peerage, and have besides 40 of the Member* that were sent from the Ratten Boroughs. He (,Mr. O'CoA NELL) slated that the poiut which was now lapsed bj the Catholics; had been observed fouiteen years ago by Mr- Gabbett, in hi$ «ble andfusefnl work, " Gabbett's Digest." He did not know of this himself, for not thinking he couM find any thing in the nest of the law favourable, to the Catholics, he had . ticver,thought of.examiniujr it. T(bey bad, however found uij *Spr-«t was a golden one (laughter), and the goose who laid it was the Uniou. The learned Gentleman tbeu said be ex- pected, that I rühmen would be' fonud to rally round him on, *he 15th February, mid that the Gentlemeu would leave Ire| land so as to be in London on or before the lath February.'

Upon the same principle of progressive increase, are we'not justified iu sup poemg that under the present system, if our Revenue should increase 20 or 30 thousand pounds annually, our Expenditure w ill be sure to keep pace with our Receipts I This is amon stious state of things, and such as must (if continued) drain away the last farthing of capital from the Colonists ! We have every reason however to expect that many of the Colo nial Establishments will be reduoed altogether, at least const derably curtailed, since their duties and labours have been j transferred ito the Commissariat Department. It is only rea- sonable as their duties are trunsleried, so also should their salaries, to those; who perform the actual public service, , which would relieve the Colony so far of the unnecessary bur- then. \\\ e understand, that this latter Establishment (which is paid hy the Mother Country, and over which the Lords of the Treasury have an immediate controul) does not cost as much motley to support, as either the Secretary's, the Sur- veyor General's, the Custom's, the Engineer's, or the Ord- nance Departments, whieh ure paid out of the Colonial Funds, although this Department hus several highly respectable commissioned Officers, tilling the most important and trusty oihecs in the Colony, and a great many More-keepers, ,Clerks, and Warehousemen scattered ovei the face ot the country, andj who! pei tortn the gieater part of the real busi- ness oj" fue.
