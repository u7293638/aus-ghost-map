BILLIEI KAN'8 FENCE. Perfavour ofjhle Editor of thIe Quensland Times, My dear bush friend, "Billie Kan," Like a thorough buemelne man, Take gour pencil and sour elate, And your fence job oalculate. Poets, 640 to the mile, For the squatter'e Â£12 sanmile; Show what fourteen trunks a day, Wired at 24. each, will pay Cat, barked, bored, borne, and sunk to stoay. Show how giante, kindly strong, Help poor squaorer gents along. Never mind that one barbed wire; Don't let on who is the buy'r; 'e a Godsend to the age Gienso its beastly esooial rage 'lia the twict of mine and thins; So s ight miles of poreoupme Is, for a twelve by eight cheque, jolly fie. Br great Barelow of the Lands, By our gory wire torn hands, Won't we take a bully fasll Oat of "Ipswich's know-all." Wthen that Anarcbist comes here, Hou he'll have, never fear, For bis libels on our posts And ble manners to our toaste, BH great raging Lynoh'e echoing ghosts. Seven posts and seven railse, Treated as we have detaildes With a take-er-leave.it ehoice Monager having oasting-vote Calls for fnoucer en-i-on, And for fi, cbesp aweat upon, Snap's the order of the day; Dinos may take it quick away; Socialism is the deuce they say, J. J. MURPHY. Norn -F.ve men fixing 200 posts a week means reven poets a day with a barbed wire and sapling rail. June 25.
