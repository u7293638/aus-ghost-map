NO. 1 SOUTH. This interesting 12-acres lease is not in the poverty-stricken condition which the public, apparently, at present assume, ifor are the tributors taking away all the gold in the mine, though doubtless they will do their level best in thisvlirection. The 40ft. level, where the tributors are working, is marvellously rich. Their time will be up in October. That they will not even exhaust the particular shoot or patch of metal they are on goes without saying, and the property will in addition have backs of from 150ft. to 400ft. still to prospect and work. This fact will probably come as a pleasant surprise to many shareholders. The company have also £1400 in band, and with the contribu tions from the. tributors m addition, will have £1700 to commence mining with from their existing 100ft. shaft. There is no ghost of a call in sight ; and doubt less many years of profitable work ahead for the little property. Should the, new lode be found also to the eastward of that at present being worked, a new and valu able asset will'be added. Ivanhoe South Extended continue to show a. high market value, but there is nothing in the mine. The same may be said of the Ivanhoe Junction. The two mines together, put up to auction, would not bring much over a thousand pounds, whereas market valuation has placed them near a million. # Some beautiful specimens of laminated 3asperoid quartz of a sea green color are irocurable in the neighborhood of Bulong, and large quantities are be lieved to ' be obtainable. Being of various degrees of color from white to dark green, it seems suitable for treat- ment cameo or relief art purposes, and a market is thought to exist for it in Europe. Specimens.have been forwarded to London that an idea of its marketable value for art decorative purposes may be obtained.
