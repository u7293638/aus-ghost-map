The Kiasaian of God,-that is, Christianity,-i said to be, "righteo -cens an peace and joy in the holy Ghost. It is true, Christians m1 not expect to be without troubls and trials. In the world "they mathare tribulation. Very likely they may hare more to bear tha bal men often hare. God did not sead u inoto the world that we might be happy hereafter. .If God's word is true, and there i an etaerityin store for us, it rally does not so r mach matter whether our ot in thi world be a bright one or a dark one, whether we bare moreor leEs of the cam moon heritage of sufferage and snorrow.
