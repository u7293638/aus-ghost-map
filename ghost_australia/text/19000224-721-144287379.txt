A 9fq.ii of Resource. Sir Jfohu Wafers was the most admirable I spy evep applied to au army. In the! Peninsular War ie gave Lord Wellington j the must ace|i rate and valuable information ahot;t the Qp.iaiarda and their movements. I On one oec.i»iiin lie ;ya« taken prisoner by a ! company of Spanish dragoons while still 1 dud iu the &uvltsi-; uniform. He was sup- 1 posed to be a stupid Qritisher who could not understand a word of French or Spanish, and his captors conversed freely before him. He learned from his guards, while riding between thom, that they were going to kill and rob him at an old will where the com pany was to stop for dinner. They would pretend that they shot him because of his attempt to escape. On reaching the mill the dragoons dis mounted and went into the house, leaving their prisoner outside, in the hope that he would attempt to escape. The instant they were out of sight, Waters threw bis cloak upon a neighbouring olive bush, and mounted his cocked hat on top. Some empty Sour sacks lay on the ground, and into one of them he crawled. A moment later the dragoons came out, fired their carbines at the supposed prisoner and galloped of£ intending to return later to rifle the body. A horse, loaded with saqks of flour, stood near the door, and Sir John, still enveloped in the sack, managed to throw himself on the horse's back, as if he were part of the load. The owner at length came out, mounted, nnd rode away without detecting the peculiar contents of one of the sacks. When far enough away for safety, Waters finding his position most uncomfortable, managed to free himself fron the sack, and sat up. The horseman, chancing to look round, beheld the'man covered with flour, and took him to be a ghost perched behind him. Terrified at the sight, be fell over in a swoon, and the supposed ghost thrust him to the ground ansl galloped off. &ir; John reached the English camp with out further adventure, and was warmly greeted by Wellington. . ?
