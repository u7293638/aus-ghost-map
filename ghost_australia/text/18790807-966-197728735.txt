THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH'S BIRTHDAY. The anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Birthday (Wednesday, August 6) was observed as a general holiday throughout the country. The weather in town was gloriously fineâ€”being in every respect such as gladdens the hearts of those who love to seize the opportunity afforded by the somewhat frequent occurrence of our colonial fttc days to enjoy themselves in the open air. Had the "Clerk" who is supposed to regulate the blowing of the wind and the falling of the rain been consulted by holiday-makers on the subject he could not have complied with their wishes more completely. There were not so many means of relaxation provided, however, as are generally presented on these anniversaries, the Exhibition Building grounds, for a wonder, remaining in their work-day quietness The principal attraction was the military sports on the Oval, which were largely attended, the Newmarket Eaces, on the Morphettville Course, being the only other public amusement. The Botanic Gardens, which have now a beautifully fresh appearance, had a large number of visitors in the afternoon. In the evening, in addition to the ordinary representation of Jane Shore's woes at the Theatre Eoyal and of the ghost's vagaries at White's Eooms, an entertainment was given at the Town Hall, and a military bill was held at the Town Hall, Norwood.
