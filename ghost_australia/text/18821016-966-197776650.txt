SPORTING. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. SECOND DAY. Melbourne, October 15. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] A light rain fell on Saturday morning and continued up to 12 o'clock, when the clouds cleared off and the sun shone, and ultimately for the rest of the day the different roads to Caulfield were lined with traps up to the hour of starting the first race. At the time the Cup was run there must have been 8,000 persons present, which is far the largest attendance ever known on this course. The rain served to lay the dust on the round, but after the firstrace the running ground was very much cut up, and in the Cup the horses were lost in a cloud of dust from the time they passed the Stand until they got to the top of the hill. The racing throughout the day was first class, but it was a disastrous afternoon for backers, as little Jack was not mentioned until late on Friday night; and as the stable did not touch him on the course, he was driven back to 100 to 6, and the public little thought that he was to figure in the light of a winner. The Assyrian's running was too bad to be correct. He was unlucky in getting a bad position at the start, and after passing the Stand with about twenty horses in front of him he never seemed to be able to get through the crowd. Sportsman was made favourite in a field of fourteen for the Hurdle Race, but there was a strong following behind Lord of Clyde, and he went to the front and stayed there jto the end. - Eighteen runners were telegraphed for^the Nursery Handicap, and Mr.' Savill supplied a favourite in Delusion. The Caulfield filly, Duenna, a very nioe youngster, waa also at 100 to 6, and the pair fought it out from start to finish: It was one .of the best-ridden races I have ever seen, and Yeomans just nicked a verdict bya "head in the last halfdozen strides.^ With this evidence of the stable being in form the Assyrian shortened to 4 to 1 when the ring was formed to the Cup. little Jack after having touched 10 to 1 in the morning was driven to a 100 to 6 ; but there were some very heavy outlays on Vtrdure and Fryingpan, both of whom touched 6 to 1 before the start. The lot were saddled and - paraded the paddock some time before, the start, and nothing looked better than Darebin, Commotion, Assyrian, Verdure, Frying pan, and Gipsy Cooper. Neither of the St. Albans pair came in for much attention^ consequent upon the report that the stable believed Mistaken to be the better of the pair.- The preliminaries took some time, but Mr. Watson had the thirty-two marshalled at the post in good time, and it was a splendid sight to see the lot spread out at the top. of the straight running. Fryingpan, •who was in a very bad . temper, broke away several times, and delayed the start a few minutes, but eventually they were sent oil their journey on very fair terms. Dougalston' appeared to De the first to move, but as they came to the Stand Verdure was clear of everything, and was making the pace a cracker ; while Darebin, Fryingpan, Calma, Tumultj Dougalston and Flying Jib were in good places. After rounding the turn Tumult made an effort to cut down the flying grey, but she shook him off with great ease, and continued to lead from Calma, Flying Jib, Darebin, and Fryingpan. .At the-five furlong post Galma was trying his best to lead Verdure and Darebin, who ,had been galloped oh- and badly cut, and had given way to Flying Jiband Fryingpan. These four were at the head of affairs on entering the straight, and as Verdure was in front when they became fairly in a line for home her name was sounded on all sides as the winner, but at the distance Little Jack got clear of the crowd, and came with a wet sail The boy . on Verdure was watching Calma on the whip hand, and not seeing Little Jack, he left his position on the rails and gave the latter a chance, which Moore immediately availed himself of, and dashing up on the inside he caught the mare, and won amid tremendous excitement by half a length. Had Sheehan not made the mistake mentioned little Jack might not have won, as there was no room for him to get past on the outside at the time he made his run. Calma, Fryingpan, and Baron Von Mueller were just at the heels of Gipsy Cooper, and then came Gudarz, Coorcena, and Prattle. The favourite, after getting off badly and being knocked out of his stride in a collision, never seemed to get going, and he was not in the hunt at any part of the race. The victory was very quietly received, and the St. Albans party are reported to have won only a trifling stake on the race. Had Verdure won the ring would have lost heavily, but as it was they won to a man, and taken all through the meeting has been a bad one for backers. As a race the Findon Harriers' Cup was a farce. Of the twentyfour starters all were out of it but four when half a mile had been traversed, and the Melbourne amateur riders are, with a few exceptions, quite out of place in a steeplechase. The Open Steeplechase was a grand race. Napoleon, the favourite, refused repeatedly; but a party of six or eight were in close company, and jumped grandly to the finish. Erin looked like winning after they got over the last fence, but he and Collingwood tired to nothing at the finish, and Sailor, who was very badly ridden by a mere lad, came in the last hundred yards, and won easily by a length. When the betting opened on the Windsor Handicap 3 to 1 was offered On the field, but directly a move was made on Prometheus the ring drew in their 'horns, and it was difficult to get 5 to 4 at the finish. Saionara, Trevellyan, and Gasalier were -all supported, but they had no chance with the brilliant son of Lurline, who jumped away in front and was never caught. The following are the results:— The following are the results:— SECOND HANDICAP HURDLE RACE. A sweepstakes of 3 sovs. each, with 100 sovs. added. One mile and a half. Mr. T.

Breechloader, Barcoo, and Hands Dovm went on with the running, Abdallah, Collingwood, and Sailor lying next; and the only incident in the position round was the falling of ganalra. and the disappearance of Stag, who baulked rapeatedly. Coming to the treble, in front of the Stand, Barcoo was showing the way from Hands Down, Abdallah. Erin, Collingwood, and Sailor, in the order named, but after rounding the turn- Abdallah went to the head of affairs,.
