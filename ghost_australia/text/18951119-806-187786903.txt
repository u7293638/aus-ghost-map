Ghost foil on them, as on us in the beginning” (i.o. r Prntioost) (Acts, 11th chapter, 15th verso).

I prefer to take my Ihoology direct from the words of the Lord Jesus, rather than from conflicting and confusing Greek lexicogra phers.- The Bible itself is tho boet dictionary ns to the meaning of “baptize,” and tboro it is usod repeatedly,, - when it- oannot mean immerse. . God baptised by “pouring,” and Hi* ministers aro perfectly justified in follow.-,, ing His example. I have no intention of ex pending further linie ou this subject-, toe like I-aul, God scat me “hot to baptise” so muoh ns- lb “preach the gospjsJ.” ; - Perbum -sat i snpiontia.
