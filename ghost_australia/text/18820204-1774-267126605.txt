Super,siition in Staffordshire. In the con illy of Stafford, about two miles north-west of ihnlley and one mile from Sedgley, lies 1 he village of Lower (Ltrnal. This plnee during (he Iasi few weeks has been in a, state of great excitement, in consequence of certain rumours beiia: prevalent that ghosts were to be SCt'n walkim; about St. James’s Church yard. The Rev. J. V. Hooker, the vicar, two years ago. was tired at and badly injured, and several persons who knew Mr. Rooker's would-he assas sin asserted that they had seen him lurking about, while, others declared that figures had’been ob served walking up and down the field which led from tin', vie,aiape into the churchyard, perform ing all kinds of strange a,nlies. In consequence of these statements, a large number of persons became so terrified as to declare openly that on no account would they walk near the churchyard after dark, and so frightened were the female members of the choir that they refused to go to practice at night unless some men accompanied them for protection. The police have been called upon to impure into the truth of the rumour, but they have not in any way been suc cessful in solving the mystery. The idea cannot lie dispelled that the church yard is haunted, and to show the kind of super stition which exists it may he stated that a woman a few nights ago called at the vicarage, and requested the Tlcv. Mr. Rookei to permit her to cut a furf four inches square from a par ticular grave in the churchyard, in which she alleged was a young man who could not lie at ease in his grave in consequence of a guilty con science. She stated that if the turf were put under the communion table, and allowed to re main four days, all ghosts would disappear, and | be laid at rest lor ever. — /11 tjn a(dx x A (‘ tvsj utper.
