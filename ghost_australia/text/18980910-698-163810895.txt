CRICKET* Gossip. By Shobtslip. 'LHow bappy could I be with either, were t'other dear charmer away ' is how the members of the 1899 Australian Eleven no doubt felt up to the final meeting of the Council. It would not have mattered j to them if it were the Cricket Council or theMelbourne Cricket Club that quietly dropped its connection with the next visit to England, so long as one - did the disappearing trick. Since the Council was formed I have been under the 'impression that the so-ca^d governing body was a useless and expensive one. If it had done some good during its five or six years of existence one would not very much have minded it costing money ; but it is a bad case where money is spent and there is no return for so long a period of labour. Ail that it bas done has been to appoint umpires, and even last season that duty was very unsatisfactorily performed, as with the intention evidently of arranging the annual meeting at such a time as to admit of the delegates viewing part if not th-i whole of the second test match, the question of appointing umpires was not considered until the season was halfway through. There is now, however, a new question that pre sents itself to the crick- 1 management in each colony, and one that has been brought about by the 'stand- and-deliver front ' adopted by the Melbourne C. C. Who is , going to manage Australian Cricket, the Melbourne Cricket Club or |be Council ? Let me here say, that when the council originally pro posed to use the Australian Eleven for placing itself in funds, I opposed it strongly, for the reason that when that body was brought into existence, in the early part of the present decade, it was not intended to have speculative powers, and those players who had spent their lifetime in 'acquiring an expert knowledge of the game should not be deprived cf the fruits of their labour now. I really do not see, so far as the outgoing team is concerned, that there is much need for any action by the council. The team can select its manager and its own combina tion, i.e., the, say. seven certainties could meet together at about Christmas time and pick the team, aud there should not be any trouble with regard to tho financial arrangements. It does not matter whether the council or the Melbourne Club send it home, or whether it goes absolutely on its own, so long as it is the best team that could be got to gether to represent Australia, which to my mind is all that the English authorities require, success, should it happen to prove victorious in the first -few opening matches, is assured. There is one thing, however, that iB worthy of note. It was stated' that Major Wardill would manage the team if it went under the au3piceB of the council. How anyone could give housing-room to such a thought it is hard under the circumstances to see. The council and the H.C.U. are in opposition, and was it likely that the latter was going to allow its officer to manage an opposition movement ? Hardly, Since the above was written the Council has virtually handed over to the M. C. C. all arrange ments in connection with tbe tour, reserving the right to control the team — an empty honour. The proposed visit of an English team in 1899 and 1900 is, however, another matter, and one that the three associations have a big voice in. Every year that an English Eleven comes to Australia the associations lose largely — all interest goes out of our intercolonial matches. It is true that the trustees of the Sydney Cricket Ground sent along £500 as compensation for Iosb sustained over the recent English visit, and tbe Melbourne C. C. treated the clubs over there similarly, but in my opinion this was not enoughs Handsome profits resulted to both bodies, while tbe £500 paid to the N.S.W. C. A. was much below that netted in the previous season. In justice to the Melbourne C. C. it should be noted that the percentage proposed to be distributed to the N.S.W.C.A. should run into much larger figures. I think that as Australians finance Aus- tralian teams ia England, English teams should be controlled by either Marylebone G.' C. or an English syndicate. Notwithstanding, however, that the two last trips have proved Eldorados the neople on the other side of the world are slow t3 fall into line. Failing that the question then arises, Are we to go without these trips simply because the English will not take the matter up ? Then the question arise, Who is to have control ? For many years post the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Melbourne C. C. have either jointly or individually been interested in these visits, some of which, especially thoBe iu the latter half of the eighties, did not return anything substantial to the promoters. Twice- the M.C.C. and ti.C.G. have joined forces since the visit by Lord Sheffield's team, and on each occasion the result has been a highly financial succesB, and probably— as showing how apparently small things govern large undertak ings—the same partnership wou'd have gone on probably for years, bad not the ground committee or the then trustees postponed the opening day of the first test match. This act was the origin of the present difficulty with regard to the next English team. But with tbe withdrawal of the Sydney Cricket Ground a new body in such matters takes up the running. The Australasian Cricket Council, which was appointed originally to control Australian teams in England and English teaniB in Australia, wants to have the sole responsibility of the next visit to Australia, and of course to pocket the pro fits. The Melbourne Club also wants to do so, ind both have approached Mr. C. W. Alcock, who, it is alleged, has communicated with each, expressing his willingness to act on its behalf. The matter, so far as the council is concerned, has been shelved, and rightly too, for a few months. It was much too soon ] to talk aboutbringing out a team in 1899-1900. While j there is a cricket council it should rale the game ] here, and it would have been wise had the Mel- ! ? ? ? ? ? i..-- ii niii i-r ? i bourne Club approached the council on the matter. As for being able to cany out the project success fully, there is absolutely no fear so fax as the club Is concerned, while the machinery of the council would have to undergo some alteration before such a big undertaking could be brought about. At the annual meeting of the old Warwick Club its forty ?fiiBt— the chairman, Mr. 0. Davis, men tioned the fact that he had recently interviewed \- M Ted.' Evans, the veteran cricketer (a life member of the dab), who retains much of his zeal and vigour, and who spoke of one of his eons (William) in the Narrabri district, who promises to be an ex exceptionally good bowler. The club still retains a wicket in the domain, which it has rented with out intermission since feeptember 1857. During the past season the club engaged in 24 matches, 5 of which were won, 4 lost, and 15 drawn. An aggre gate of 3422 for 188 wickets, being an average of 18*49 per wicket, was compiled ; while their oppo nents compiled 2150 runs for 151 wickets, an average of 14'23 per wicket. The trophies for batting-and bowling, presented by the president, Mr. J. W. Turner, principal of the Model P. School, Fort ?treet, were both won by Mr. George Palmer, with an average of 27*6 for 23 innings batting, and 9*5 for 21 wickets bowling. In the course of an interview with Lockwood, the Surrey professional, published in ' Cricket,' he says that twice he has been hit for 20 in the over (five balls), once by Hall, of Derbyshire, who hit him four times over cover point's head, and the fifth was a snick through the slips. The four fours over cover point's head calls to mind M'Laren's strokes in the same direction oS M'Kibbin on the Sydney Cricket Ground. There is a de±l of luck in getting on to the ball almoBt on the wide mark at the precise moment to send it in that direction, and he who plays it must be content to take a big risk, in fact, there is none greater. The other who landed Lockwood for 20 was S. M. J. Woods. Asked was he not the dis coverer of Eanjitsinhji Lockwood replied, ' I don't know about that exactly, but I waB bowling at the University for a month with Richardson and EFay ward in the year when Banjitsinbji got his blue. He used then to try to pull everything to the outside, and being quick to pick up hints he was bowled less frequently ajftame went on, He always preferred the faBt bowlers. I remember bowling to him one day when Mr. Jackson, who was then the captain of the team, came up and looked on. He asked me what I thought of him, and I said, ' Well, 6ir, you are playing two or three worse Blues than he ib.' Then he asked, ' Can he really play ? ' I said, 4 Well, sir, you come and try and bowl him out ! ' He laughed, and went away, and I believe he took notice of him afterwards. At any rate, Mr. Jackson gave him a fair trial, and also gave him his ' Blue.' ' Yorkshire defeated Somersetshire by six wickets. It was hardly expected that the latter county would win, though it was just as well that Yorkshire did not require to get a hundred in the second innings, ae four wickets were lost iu knocking off the re quired 54. The only century registered was credited to P. S. Jackson, 139, while the beBtfor Somerset shire was S. M. J. Woods's 95 in his second venture. Little Hirst had the best results with the ball — six for 83 — about his beBt effort since he left Australia. There were three centuries in Hampshire v. Sur rey, A. J. L. Hill 199, the highest up to that time tor individual scoring, Abel 111, and Lockwood 109 The last mentioned secured nine wickets for 131 in an aggregateof 566 for 15 wickets by Hampshire. He has thiB season been remarkably consistent, in fact, it ib his best since Stoddart's first team in Australia, when much was expected of him. So far aa ho tv ling is concerned, he has displaced Richardson. We would have to wait a long time before the Surrey express bowler would have 100 against his name. E. A. English, for Hampshire, missed making the fourth with a century against his name by two runs. The result was a draw. W. G. Grace followed up his Jubilee with a great innings of 168, and in the second ran up 38 not out, 206 for once out. Notts replied to Gloucestershire's 307 with 291, Gunn making 74, and in the second innings the former lost four for 56 when ' full time,' aa our footballers say, arrived. Another draw in this series was Kent v. Essex. Sent 280— C. J. Burnup 131, J. R. Mason 77, rest a very long, way off, and 120 for one wicket in the second innings. Essex 334 — Perrin 106, not out, rest not so far as were the men of Sent. Lancashire's 184 were enough to secure a win of an innings and 24 over Leicestershire's 172 and 288. Eccles 139 was top. For the defeated side there were a couple of good doubles, notably Brown 50 not out and 110, and Coe'e 61 and 47. The order of ' the thousand ' this year was Tylderiley, Jackson, Abel, Grace, and Storer. Ranjitsinhji has written a cheap popular work entitled ' With Stoddart's team in Australia.' W. G. Grace eras too lame to play for Gloucester v. Yorkshire. He met with an injury _ in his Jubilee match, and could net go in earlier than about sixth in the second innings. As he was able to play in the following engagement and scored 163 aud 38 not out, the leg could not have troubled him very much, but it appears to have got worse by the following fixture. Gloucester, without ' W. G.,' is, to use an oft-repeated remark, like Hamlet without the ghost, and it is not surprising to find that county defeated by an innings and 17 runs. F. S. Jackson was in very fine form, following up his 139 against Somerset with 160. The nearest score to thiB was Lord Hawke's 36. C. O. H. Sewell, in the second venture of Gloucestershire, carried his bat right through for 88 out of 127, an extraordinary performance, especially as the nearest waB 11 by W. S. A. Brown. Lancashire inflicted a five wicket defeat on Somer set, notwithstanding that the latter totalled 314 ia the first effort, a compilation that exceeded that of the victors by 17* Cuttell and Mold, in the' eecond innings, with four for 17 and three for 57, were instrumental in disposing of Somerset for only 131. A fair average was maintained by run-getterB. Warwickshire and Derbyshire played a draw, which stood at the finish in favour of the latter. Derbyshire put up 285 and 8 for 224 (innings de clared closed), and Warwickshire replied with 217 and four ior 173. W. G. Quaife, was going stronely at the finish with 60 on and not out. For Derby shire S. H. Evershed played a long innings for 153, but there was a great falling off iu the rest, the nearest being G. Davidscn's 24. In the second innings Evershed was bowled for nothing. The match between Kent and Surrey was in au interesting stage when rain caused an abandonment. On the first innings the difference in favour of Surrey was only 13, but in the eecond Kent had 213 up, and Surrey had lost four for 96. Strange to say, the two not out batsmen had not had time to break the ice. Tbe only century in the engagement was credited to Hayward 101, and like Evershed in the paragraph immediately preceding this, he was dis posed of without scoring in the second innings. Richardson's five wickets cost 152, Lockwood again beating him with six for 126. Thanks to brilliant play by C. B. Fry and sub stantial work by W. L. Murdoch, Kellick, and Butt, Suseex was enabled to play a meritorious draw with j Middlesex. It was in this match that Fry made his two centuries, making the eleventh time that it has taken place in first- cless cricket. W. L.'s contributions were 43 and 38, Albert Trott getting him on each occasion. On beliatf of Middlesex, A. E. Stoddart put in two useful contributions of 69 and 42, and was a long way the best performer on the side with the bat. Sussex applied the closure with seven for 224, and Middlesex had seven for 150, requiring 151 to avert defeat. Trott waa rather expensive, securing six wickets fox 183, and failed with the bat.. A. J. L. Hill, like F. S. Jackson, -followed ap one century with another. In the former engagement he missed the second hundred by one, then the highest individual score of the season, and against Essex he was responsible for 104. On the same side Major Poors compiled 107- For Essex RusBell played a remarkable innings. He started with two fives and tnree fours, and continuing in this fashion he finally carried out his bat for 122. All but one, not exclud ing ' extras,' secured double figures, and that one had nine against his name. Essex's 425 enabled it to secure a nine wickets win. Mead took seven for 100 and five for 61 for Essex. The Marylebone Club is seriously considering the question of chucking, and tbe matter is not being lost in second-class cricket. D. Lowe came under the ban of ritchmarsh recently, and in the Worces tershire-Wiltshire fixture, which concluded^ on Sat urday, Jem Phillips penalised both Eldridge and Smart, the Wiltshire wicketkeeper, who was called upon to bowl. ' j An excellent finish by Gloucestershire against Lancashire made the latter feel queerly. There were 144 runs required when Board, who was out with the last team, joined Champain, and 78 of the above were hit off before Board was disposed of. Champain scored 113 not out. A miserable 44 in the first innings lost the match for Grace's team. Mold took six for 22, but in the second one for 108, and Cuttell four for 18 and eight for 105. ' W. G. ' followed up his 168 with 1 and 5. Bagfihaw was responsible for two fine contribu tions for Derbyshire v. Yorkshire in a drawn game, with 68 and not out 100. The 100 exactly would seem to be more frequently scored than any other figure. Storer did remarkably well with 96 and 30. Tunnicliffe led easily for Yorkshire with 84. A capital story is sent by Canon Bell to the ' Westminster Gazette,' and is as follows : — ' The re aJ story about Grace and the hymn is as follows : I was the master who was reading prayers in chapel that evening, and gave out the hymn. I was also choirmaster, and it was I who had arranged, the Saturday previous, the hymns for the week, and among them was the one in question, 4 Sweet Saviour, bless us ere we go,' and, of course, it was absolutely unintentional on my part that it should have been down for the evenings wben Grace .was in chapel. Well, these are the facts. Grace was bring ing an eleven from Gloucestershire to play the Marlborough Boys, and in the train he made a bet that he would get 100 runs, and also hit a bail into ? Sun-lime ' — a very big hit, and which had only once been done. I was in with bim, and a boy called Kernpe bowled him clean with as fine a ball as I ever saw, I think for only three runs, and therefore neither the century nor the big hit came off. He came to chapel in the evening, and the lines were suug, ' The scanty triumphs Grace hath won, The broken vow, the,' &o.; I believe it was generally thought that I had done it of set purpose. It was absolutely accidental.— Faithfully yours, HENRY BELL. Vicar of Muncaeter, Hon. Canon of Carlisle. Muncaster Chase, Cumberland, July 21. P.S.— Perhaps you may like the folio (ring coinci dence, which also happened at Marlborough : — ' The Cheltenham Boys came to play Marlborough on their ground, and ware defeated, most of the runs having been made, and most of the wickets taken, by two boys, Wood and Stone. Inchapel the hymn, ' From Greenland's icy mountains,' was sung, where the lines occur, ' The heathen in their blindness bow down to wood and stone.' This also was pure acci dent.— H. B.' A meeting of the University Cricket Club waB held at the Oxford Hotel on the 3lst ultimo. The meeting wae called for the purpose, of considering the position of the club with regard to next season's I operations. It was intended that application should ' be made to the New South Wales Cricket Associa tion for permission to play an undergraduate team in the second grade competition, but as the programme of matches in that series had already been drawn up an apparently insurmountable difficulty had cropped np. After a discussion the meeting adjourned with out anything definite having been arrived at. The name of C. B. Fry is to be added to the list of those who have scored a century in each iaamgs in a first-class match. He compiled 108 and 123 not out for Sussex v. Middlesex on July 25 and 27. Those whose names already appear on the list are : — W. G. Grace (three times), 130 and 102*, 131 and 103*, 148 and 153 ; G. Brann, 105 and 101 ; A. E. Stoddart, 195* and 124 ; C. J. Eady (Tasmania), 116 and 112* ; W. Storer, 100 and 100* ; K. S. Ranjit ainhji, 100 and 125* ; J. T. Tyldesley, 106 and 100* : and A. C. M'Laren (at Sydney}, 142 and 100. There are some remarkable points about these figures. In the 26 three-figure scores five of them are exactly the hundred, Storer being credited with a pair : LI of them are 108 or under, and 10 are over 108 ; and there are eight not-outs. Tbe years embraced in the above figures are from 1868 to 189S. The following were the English averages up to 23rd July:— BATTING AVEBAGES (Minimum 12 Innings). !
