E DITOR. r AN"ILLE LITY ., (TO THEl EDITORb OT- THE iIIIALD.) i S? ,--Allowme to point out to the gentle men wlio elecbed the officers for' the Colac Amateur Turf Club about a fortnight since, that they considerably-exceeded their:~iity.' Theywere simply appointed to make arrange inents for the annual race meeting, not to elect office-bearers. The latter should be electedi at an annual)general jmeeting of the. members of the club, according to all racingl law and practico, so,that everyone belonlging to the club might have a voice (and very properly so) in theelection of the officers, and thus do ,away, with' 'suspicion, of cliqieism.

Meantidme, the late election'6f officers is altogether wrong and illegal, ld should be enquired into. i I' am, Sir, &c;,. JORROOKS'SS GHOST. Colec, 2nd November, 1876. :
