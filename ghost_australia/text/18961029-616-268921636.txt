HOPE. They say that the name of the station is changed, and that the dog is dead, , but I remember, and I think I shall re member always. In a shaii) V of a valley, between two tali, unheeding mountains, stood a little brown station, all alone. It looked like a knot in the end of the brown rag of road that hung over the low ridge beyond it. “Hope” was the name in the middle of the weathered sign-board, with “Winnipeg, — miles,” at the nearer end. and “Vancouver, — miles,” at the farther. There was small token of life about the building so far as even we in the observation car could see, so, when the conductor came back from the office with his orders, we wondered why the train did not go on. But pretty soon a tall old man, with a red flag under his arm. came up the track ahead to the station platform. Some of us had alighted, and to us he volunteered, while he rolled his flag closer:— “Rock on the track!” “Is it very large?” asked someone. “Nope; they’ll get it off purty soon; like ’nough, in ’bout ten minutes.” That accent was unmistakably from the “States,” and I came nearer where I could hear all he said. He sat down on a pile of boxes, and. In reply to some remark, said meditatively: .. “Nod; tralpa dpnVbev much ■’caalon to , stopiberfflong nowadays/T'-IIsed to.be n -puty decent'-mine-- up " yonder,”; jerk ing his head toward the little road; “then they war some doin’s here.” “Mine abandoned?” “Eaup.” lie was going on: when an other idea struck him. He looked round uneasily. “They liain't none of you seen Roliy, liov yon?” “Who's Roily?” “W’y, Roily, lie's the dorg:” his eyes grew anxious. “He's a great institution ’round these parts. Roily is.” He rose and went, quickly to the door of the station, opened it, and put his head inside. “Say, Bennie, where's Roll ?” lie called. His voice was different from that in which lie spoke to the tnen out side. Tlie answer was inaudible. “Humph! Curious, ain’t it? When did he go?” Again the inaudible reply. “Well, lie must a’ heard the whistle.” He came back to the travellers, but with his eyes on the brown road oyer the ridge. “Didn’t it pan out?" asked one. “Hull? Oh. the mine! I dunno. I guess ’twould of-” but the old idea was too strong—his eyes sought the slope again. “Now. where in time is that dorg? He ain’t use’ to missin" trains.” “What was the matter at the mine?” “Oh,” there was ghosts came there, ’n’ they scart everybody, ’u’ now they won’t no one go niglr lint Roily, and he’s interested. Wish't he'd come, any “Well. what is it about Roily, my friend, is he your dog?” asked a big. quiet man. standing near with his wife. “Nope. That is, lie is and lie ain’t— one way he’s mine, and two he ain’t— one way lie's mine, ’cause I feed ’im and hanker after ’im ef lie ain’t round. One way lie ain't mine, lie’s Bennie’s, ’cause everything I’ve got that Bennie hankers after is his’n. an’ he thinks a heap o’ Roily. Bcnuie’s the telegraph here. “ ’Notlicr way, lie ain’t mine nor Bonnie's neither. lie liisself thinks lie b’longs to a man ’t liain't been ’round here quite a spell—tlie last contractor at the ‘Hope.’ He left in a ioetle hurry one night, bein’ found with some mine pay money mixed into his own inside pocket by mistake, ’n’ he forgot tlie dorg.” One traveller, acquainted with west ern euphemisms asked: “Did they hang or shoot him?” “Shot ’im; sent tlie remnants cast in a box. We liain’t lookin’ for ’im back, but Roily is. Yes, sir. lie’s on band every train, an’ between times lie goes up to the mine to see cf bis man has slipped by unbeknowest an’ gone up there.” . .Tust then the conductor, passing, said: “Nearly ready; all aboard.” We started reluctantly for the car.. “Can’t think what on ’arth keeps ’im. He’ll cry all day ef he misses this train.” We were all on board now. The con ductor stood, watch in hand, his eyes, too. on tlie road. “There he is!” someone shouted. “He knowed he was late, an’ took the short cut,” exclaimed the old man. Our eyes left the road, and at the other end of the platform met a small, smooth coated black and white mongrel, all dusty and panting, crouched with quivering flanks by the steps of the last car. a Pullman. The dog’s eyes were on the porter. The porter looked to the conductor for a sign; the conductor looked at his watch and his orders, and nodded. Then the porter lifted the eager little brute into the car vestibule. We in the observation car all waited, with eves on the door of the nearest Pullman; all but the quiet man, who . had retired into the front corner of the car behind his newspaper. “Blest if I want to see the beast dis appointed,” lie said to liis wife. ' Does he go through the whole train? I asked the old man. “Yes. miss, all but the col-nist ear and the emigrant; he knows that ain’t the kind.” Just then the Pullman door opened and the porter came through, followed by .the-dog. stepping high and nervously. There were a great many In the car, and the dog was bewildered. The porter picked him up and put him on one of the seats, a double row of which ran back to back down the centre of the car. Tlie dog put bis paws on the back of the seat and looked all around, ears up, nos trils moving, flanks quivering, tail straight out and slowly waving. Suddenly lie gave a sharp yell, and bounded over the centre seats down tlie aisle like a young tornado, and stopped with both paws on the qniet man’s knees, yelping, dancing, tearing the newspapers down upon himself. The man took the paper away, and the dog leaped toward his face with a squeal. But the squeal broke half way. and tlie dog fell back on all fours, still as a stone. The quiet man looked at him kindly and put ont a hand to pat him. The dog came closer, his eyes al ways on tlie man’s face, and softly put liis'paws on the knees again. The man ‘“Well, Roily!” The dog's head went on one side a moment, the name was all right, but the voice—the voice— He got down and backed off, bis tail between bis legs, liis ears wavering; be gave one low. questioning whine, then slowly answered the porter’s call. At the top of the ear steps he paused anil came back. With head on a side and paw raised he looked again, and then with a sharp sort of bark turned back and went down. A moment afterward the conductor’s watch snapped; he waved his hand and. the train drew out, up the broad can yon of tlie Chanting Bow. But our eyes were turned back to the platform, where the dog stocld, poised, head ou a side, and foot lifted, looking after us. Tlie quiet man didn’t draw back till we bad rounded a curve; then he found a cinder in his eye. “Nice scenery” he said.—(M.O.P., In the “New York Post”)
