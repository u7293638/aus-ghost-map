A Ghost's Photograph. Most people think that a photograph is true in every particular, that like the fam- ous George Washington it cannot lie. The camera certainly, like a young and innocent child, has a predisposition to truth, but it can assuredly be made to lie. The famous Mrs. Mellon, the 'spook' manufacturer, used to triumphantly exhibit a photograph of ' Cissy,' as absolute proof to infidels of the truth of her assertions. Yet a ghost can be manufactured on a photo very simply ; the method is to take on the plate that has already been used to photograph the room, the figure in a white sheet which is to represent the ghost; the exposure must be instantaneous only, time must not be given for the camera to get a true impression of tbe object ; the result is the faintest shadow of white, perfect in outline, through which can be seen the table or the chair on the other side. Anyone who has not seen a ghost should endeavor to see the photo of one, it will give a very fair idea of what the thing is like.
