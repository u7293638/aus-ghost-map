It is possible that the I uselessness of the whole matter is as evident to the members who take part in it as it evidently is to the few who pay to the wearied and perfunctory champions the compliment of pretending to linton If so, this would account for the dreary, forced, and lifeless tone of the debate What it does not account for is the apparent belief that this dismal and futile function is indispensable to the com- pleteness of Pnihainontarj procedure and that it in some mysterious way fulfils the duty of the Legislature, and adds new safeguards to the proper management of public affairs Though the portion of this process of elimination which is devoted to finance is but a small one, time is made to assume a form with respect to which it is time to ask some serious questions Is it really be come impossible in this colony to discuss the annual nee aunts presented to Parliaments the Treasury. without busing the whole criticism on the allegation that the account-, presented are but a tissue of fabrications that has been the reception accorded by, the Opposition to even financial statement submitted to Parliament by the present Treasurer The charge has been made on each occasion and has been supported by the same purely arbitrary, unverified statements It has "done on the basis of ignoring Acts of Parliament which the assailants helped to p"" lack of disregarding information submitted when the House was asked to wass them. When the treasurer brought up his 4r=[ I elect under the new cash it' but was decided that in place of lawn. " surplus- of £o30,000 been realm find a Loutit of a million It was shown that this allegation was founded on the assumption that some Acts of Parliament which were passed into law did not pass that the provision thus made for actual and estimated liabilites was never made that a whole scheme of extinguish - most of liability, in passing; which the accused took part, had never been nitro (blood The young person who prayed to the gods to annihilate time and space and make two lovers happy his counterparts in those Opposition critics who desired the annihilation of a Parliamentary session to enable them to attain forgery by demonstrating the approaching bankruptcy of their country Will it be believed that after (his extraordinary pro court had been (twice refused and ox closed, it has been actually revived during the present debate in the attempt to give reality to a purely imaginary deficit ? Well might the Treasurer appeal some what taken aback to find himself confronted once more by the ghost of " the same old million," which, as he said, had done duty three times before And here we desire to call attention to the peculiar character of what is called financial criticism by the present Opposi- tion When the Treasurer brought in his first budget under the new system it was said that he would be oak down not join, inasmuch as no confusion of accounts 01 bewilderment of the public mind was possible on the basis of cash payment The next year came, but it did not bring a breakdown It brought another surplus, a moderate but a satisfactory one The first year it was declared, wholly from the inner consciousness of the critics, that the Treasurer was lent me a lot of accounts over to the next financial year If that was done, which there is not the slightest reason for believing, every account so thrown over had to be paid in the following year and included in its expenditure The car did not break down under the weight, or afford the least evidence of such a proceeding. The Treasurer's estimates were ridiculed, but still, with an inevitable margin of error in detail, they have twice come out with remarkable accuracy in gross Ltorv test which could fairly or unfairly be applied has been employed, with the result that not a single fact or discovery has been brought to light to discrediting accounts against which this ruthless war of assertion told dispersion has been carried on Even yet we have not dwelt on the peculiar element by which the financial difficulties of the Opposition is characterised The public pays so little heed to speeches of financial controversy, and construes the utterances of politicians in so liberally Pickwickian a sense, that it does not realise the nature of the allegations which are made in Parliament night after night with respect to the public accounts of the country" The changes of the Opposition are not matters of more difference of opinion about a financial policy or about the probability or otherwise of certain economic anticipations being borne out They are of a totally different tones Last night, for example, it was stated by the Leader of the Opposition stated as mere matters of course about which there could be no dispute-that (1) while the Treasurer had pretended each year to show a surplus, he had really spent a million in excess of his receipts that (2 he had exhibited a " fictitious balance" on the credit side, a bogus surplus " each year that (J) he had obtained power to issue 'leases bills for over a million on the statement that money was owing which in fact was not owing, and that (1) he had "deceived Parliament and the country " Thus, it will be seen, are not charges of an ordinary or a merely political character They amount to the assertion that our public accounts are fictitious, false, and fraudulent, and are the outcome of a vast conspiracy, to which such others as the Auditor-General and the higher officers of the Treasury must boB accomplices These charges are made without any apparent sense of their criminating character They are offered merely as necessary " financial criticism," put forward just to fill the bill " It is self-evident that the accusers do not take their own charges seriously) They would doubtless be astonished if they found anyone did so If a single member of the Opposition locally believed these accusa- tions in the full sense of the words in which they are stated he would at once transfer the scene of war from Parliament to the country, and would raise an agita- tion which would not rest till public indignation had driven the culprits from office and made it impossible for them over to regain it Indeed the work of purification would require a -very wide scope, inasmuch as we And the Labour Bureau frequently charged with falsifying its returns to conceal the real numbers of the unemployed, and it is now alleged that the statistics of manufacturing industries published by the Government statists New South Wales and Victoria are " not reliable," and are in fact concoctions, to give a fictitious advantage to this colony. The w earned eye ranges over a world of fraud and falsehood, and would find the prospect one of universal gloom were it not able to rest upon the little islet of truth and purity afforded by tho side of the Opposition, whose statements and statistics can alt n s be trusted, inasmuch as they are warranted by the makers Happily this process has been carried to such an extent that the reputation of the colony has become " immune " against virus coming from such a source, and the charges fail to cause disquietude to the public, or even to secure relief from the outside detractors of the colony who aid to give them circulation The annual report showing the operations of the Labour Bureau for the year ended in June last is a satisfactory document It not only demonstrates that the institution is effectively doing the work for which it was primarily estate- lished that is, of bringing unemployed labour into touch with opportunity but that it is making a noticeable improvement in the number or the unemploy and as well. The two things do not necessarily go to gether If times were as bad as some make it their business to describe, the number of unemployed would tend to in these rather than to diminish, whatever facilities might be afforded for finding employment when it offered. The letters show that this is not the case for loot, The number of unemployed who registered at the Bureau every day averaged 36 63, w hill during the time cow bred by this report the average fell to 21 43 A fact like that speaks oloiiiiontlj for itself, whether we attribute it to diseased conditions of prosperous activity or to the efficiency of the bureau But as a matter of fact the latter would be inoperative in this particular direction without the former., however, efficient the management of the Bureau might be It a greater number of unemployed are absorbed, it must be because in reaped opportunity, are offered for employment, and to admit this is to concede an improvement in labour conditions that can only go hand in hand with a proportionate increase in pro- writ-, A good deal may still remain to be desired in this direction, but the indication is not the less encouraging because that is the case Take in conjunction with those figures the fact that a weekly average of 1570 men found employment on relief works round Sydney in 1896, while for the year now dealt with the weekly average has been reduced to 106 2, and we get the clue to the work the Bureau is doing One of the principal difficulties in the Australian labour market arises from the circumstances often admitted and com mounted on that the working population is over contra missed Mon flock to the city to find work, in the belief that the opening there is unlimited Worse still, they come because they wish to participate in the relief that the Government may be induced to provide in response to the pressure brought to bear on it The report speaks of a class of men always ready to fatten on idleness and mistaken charity This is doubtless a pleasing figure of speech so far as the process described is concerned, but there is no metaphor about the fact implied There is evidently a rooted repugnance the part of many to v nature afield in search of employment, beyond the reach of casualties works or the assistance of unusual thing It has come to be recognised, partly no doubt as the result of indiscriminate relief works in the past, that there were chances in the city which were wanting in the country It has been the aim of the Labour Bureau to dispel this impression The system of registration pursued puts the Bureau in touch with unemployed labour on the one hand, while on the other it is in a position to learn where openings for Inborn mo available It then becomes the business of the Bureau to bring the two together, at the cost of the conveyance of candidates for employment to the place where opportunity is available Some critics of the system may find a touch of socialism or of grandmotherly government in this, and perhaps an undue interference with the perquisites of the registry office keepers Of course the answer to that 1 md of hyper criticism is that those unemployed are not usually in a position to pay the charges of the registry offices, while the existence of a disproportionate number of unemployed is sufficient proof of the inability of these institutions to cope with the situation in any case One of the features of the report is the statement made that what may be called the up-country industries, such as no occasion for agricultural, pastoral, and mining employment, are showing satisfactory signs of revival This is evidenced by the extent to which labour is absorbed in these several directions, and the But one is doing good work in giving its clients the opportunity to profit by these changing conditions It is a remarkable fact, and one full of interest and significance to the observer of our social and industrial conditions, that in five years no less than 21,707 men have been assisted to go fossicking up country A circumstance like this carries with it a whole volume of commentary on the difference between the labour market in this colony and that of other countries In what other part of the world, it may reasonably, be asked, would it be possible to employ so many men in a time of industrial depression ? We may set aside the instance quoted of one of the men so assisted, who found fortune where he only sought a means of livelihood 'The distance is exceptional, but where else would such an exception be possible ? But what is fairly deducible from the report is this, that under a judicious and non charitable system of assistance there are means of employment and livelihood available in the colony outside the ordinary labour market, while so far as that market is itself concerned there are many oppor tunitiesforiemunorativooccupation if the tendency to excessive centralisation can be counteracted The working classes of the city that is, the men whose families are growing up here have the first right to protest against this undue interference and competition and in connection with this it is worth noting that the report doubts the genuine benefit of relief works except in the cases of married men Of course there may be exceptions, but roughly speaking it is the business of the Bureau to distribute the single men who are unemployed about the country as much as possible That this is being done, not withstanding the fanciful reports lately contradicted, is proved by the fact that there are not more than three or four thousand unemployed in Sydney and suburbs at the present time It is evidently thought by the traders resident in the Solomon Islands that the promptitude and activity shown by Mr Woodford, the British Resident, in chasing the murderers of a French settler and two of his labourers, will have a most wholesome effect upon the natives Hitherto the custom has been too often to wait for a man of war to punish the natives for outrages, and the system has been most unsatisfactory Mr Woodford started as soon as he heard the now with the few native police at his disposal, and he was joined by all the settlers in the neighbourhood, who felt that their own lives were being placed in jeopardy With this force Mr Woodford was able to march some distance inland, and to attack one or two villages which were supposed to be concerned in the crime It is true that he has not been able to capture the actual murderers, but he has arrested the men who are believed to have been the instiga- tots of the outrage Ihibisamostimportant matter The coast tubes are often plausible to foreigners and appear to be friendly , it is notorious that the bush tribes, believing themselves to be safe in their fastnesses, are always ready for mischief, and they appear to have been emboldened of Into because they have not been reached by any punishment for their misdeeds But in this instance. it seems that they were bribed by members of a coast tribe, who hoped to keep the transaction biddon, and to escape on the plea that they were not the actual criminals the fact that they can be brought to justice, and that their training is of no avail, should have a good influence The question, however, that arises out of the affair is this, way Mr Woodford should not have a body of disciplined native police sufficient to protect the lives and properties of the settlers One of the first things done 1 by Sir William MacGregor in New Guinea was to organise a police force, which has done excellent service The same principle is adopted in all the tropical colonies and settlements Mr Woodford is in a subordinate position, dependent upon the Governor of Fiji who is the Ililli Com missioner for the Pacific But, by the tenders pay taxes, and as the recent exploit makes clear what may dip low by raj d punishment, there should surely be no financial obstacle in the way of giving to Mr Woodford a bin ill an 1 oflu lout police force" This would probably put an end to half the troubles in the Solomon Islands Very LifjLr NEWS-On AVcliif Bay Captain In 3 f t Itjilit c 116 it ( ov quiet House and tice ill was red n 1 j storm j ty Cii tun Stanley On 1 ii 1 next 1 21 Excellency the Guy at or will after a 1 a City Mission con crt it the Town Hall On the foil ming ii ural ly he will be present at a rifle match at Randwick and will lunch with the council A fountain at Ryde, subscribed for by the citizens, will be an veiled by him on the 10th instant Lord Hampden will be the guest of Lord Brassey at Government House, Melbourne, the week afternoon, that being Melbourne Cup week Tur Land and Income Tax Validating Bill -The Premier states that as the Cabinet has not meet till next Tuesday no decision will be come to in regard to the Land and Income i ave.
