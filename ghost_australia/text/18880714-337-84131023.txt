GAIETY THEATRE. " Hamlet." " Hamlet " was produced at the Gaiety Theatre on Friday night of last week. Alfred Dampier's Hamlet is a stud,)—it is throughout earnest, in tensely performed, and carries with it an impress of conscientious fidelity to a high ideal formed of the author's own purpose in creation of the character. I should say, from Dampier's acting, that he is one of that class of critics who believe that Hamlet was not really mad, but only pretended to be. The meditative glamor which he throws over the soliloquy, commencing " To be or not to be," was very fine He was favored with several calls before the curtain.*1 Miss Katherine Russell was Ophelia, and, though pathetic and for i'»le in her delineation, Ophelia wtr.h a very decided lisp can't hope to be a very decided success St .neham as the King was a stick. Miss >uiia Merton gave a very fair .representation of the Qieen. Watkin Wynn, as Horatio; Alfred Boothmnn, as Laertes; and Sam P>ole, as Fir:*t Gravedigger, were all good. Dampier himself could not have1 been excelled. Edmund Holloway made a first-class Ghost.
