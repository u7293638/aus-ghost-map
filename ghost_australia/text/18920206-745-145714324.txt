ANTS IN THE BILLY Gen. See's 1ST.B. to Business Sheet is reckoned veiy strong by the members, and to .' us it seems ill advised. It either is not as . exj)licit as it should be, or else it explains too much. Wagga meeting condemned it Avarmly, ' . not so much on account of the strange argu- I ' nients used, but because it doesn't look the square' thing to use the business sheet to argue .for or against any proposition — that is, unless all hands are allowed to haA^e a cut in. There — must-be-a-mistake-someAvhere, for our Bourke correspondent says that the proposal was sent up by a unanimous \o\e of members at annual meeting, not from one of the com mittee, as 'stated in the' N.B. * * - '* - It has just leaked out that a goodly sec tion of those avIio Aroted against -JRae' at the Wagga meeting did so in obedience to a . command -from ? their r /Order. In a secret ballot they AVQ^k-'se'e' the order asphyxiated ?=—-?--? before voting.;;. -jfor anything* -but, a Labor member and Republicanism.

We hear of Unionists patronising some business places where tlie 9 Hummer is boy cotted, and; just .wish, to remind all. hands. . that Unionists are not half using their power ? unless they help their, friends, . and keep clear of their enemies. There are people in eArery ? toAVii, from Bombala to. Tocumwal, who ;? speak fair to the face of a man with a cheque, but who jump on Unionism wheneATer they can do so on the sly. There are a few of this sort. in Wagga, so don't be afraid to make . inquiries before spending, your money. Re member, these, jokers willflog you with your own whip if they get a chance. . . , '? * # *- # ' .'''.- ? , Gas dividends, . Melbourne, only 20 per ? (1'.
