Open Column. (Correspondence on subjects of public in terest is invited, bat the editor does not hold himself responsible for theopiuions expressed ) (to the editor of Walcha Witness.) Sir, — Many people hold the despic able opinion that people are justified: in acting dishonourably and deceitfully during elections. I read with pain in. your columns, and alpo in other district papers, letters over the names of reputable residents, who clearly try w piuue a isisti issae oeiore the public in order to mislead ignorant and un thinking electors, and induce them to do a wrong and wicked act against the people of this country. One of these writers carefully avoids saying a single word about what is clearly the object^ of his letter, viz : To sacrifice, everjjf consideration of honourable conduct in a parliamentary representative, to continue to block and burke any ex pression of the will of the people by an unworkable constitutian, and to force the working people to. carry the heavy end of .-taxation, .for .no other reason than that he and his class may continue to escape paying their fair share of the expenses of Government,, by a direct charge on their land and incomes. One of this class of men was lately heard to say, 'I am a freetrader, but I am supporting the protection candidate, because, - don't you see? freetrade means a land tax.'r From a moral point of view this expediency is very contemptible and sad. It is on » pa«- with letting rabbits: loose on a man's run in order to get work trapping them, nnd many other similar acts commonly called crimes. It is shameful for these men to use the public press with the deliberate object of holding the ghost protection up 011 end of a stick to frighten credulous: voters from the road where they might see men in high positions sneaking out of giving their fair share towards the public expenses of Government. These letter writers, while advocating protec tion to mislead the people, are not protectionists, for several reasons. They are men of intelligence, they have none of these petty objects to influence them that so commonly affect city manufacturers and small trades men in the country, whose only, desire is monopoly— as far as possible — ire their several callings. They have none of the doll, selfish and suspicious facial expressions that almost infallably mark out the protectionist among the farming and labouring class. These great men would declare themselves ?at a moment's notice if there happened' to be no laod and income tax im minent, or if they could shunt the cost of Government on to the slioulders of poorer people. Such unpatriotic and! selfish doings, on the part of many of the wealthy of the country, have been the cause of so much barren and badf legislation, and bad legislation has been the most direct cause of the miserable ruin now afflicting this, one of the finest countries in the world,. We will never get prosperity until met* do the right thing because it is riglilj, and until our national character ? is more in touch with Christian principles. Yours faithfully, ELECTOR. At the close of every football season in England, one of the leading news papers — the conductors of whicl* evidently do pot believe in the game — publishes what it styles a ' Butcher's Bill.' The 'bill 'shows that during the past season there were twenty deaths from injuries received on the football field, and tltat over 150 legs, arms, and collarbones were . broken, besides many cases of concussion of the brain and spine paralysis, kneecaps split, and hundreds of minor casuali1 ties.
