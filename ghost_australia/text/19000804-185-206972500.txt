PUBLISHED BY SPECIAL ARRANGE MENT. LOYAL TO THE LAST. COPYRIGHT. CHAPTER VII. By M. E. 0. Malen, Author of “A Fatal Silence,” “A Daugh ter of the Philistines,” "Neither Widow nor Wife,” “Those Three,” “Some Per son or Persons Unknown,” etc., etc. -Yours obedient, “Hannah Wilson.” That evening Mr Moore received a visit from Mr Lawson, the senior partner in the firm of Lawson and Dale, lawyers, at Barnwell. Miss Moore had been a client of theirs for some years, he. said, introducing himself and he had heart through Dr Lethbridge of her sad and mysterious death, , and thought .it. right to let Air Moore know at onee.that she had left a will.' “ Which I propose to read after the funeral, if agreeable to yon,” he concluded politely. “ Just as you think proper,” replied Air Aloore, with absolute indifference. “I believe it is the usual thing, is it not?” “ Quite the usual thing. At the same time there is no objection to giving you an idea of the contents, if yon wish.” “Thank you; I do not wish,” replied the vicar, who could not conjure up aitv interest in the subject. “I knew my cousin very slightly.” “Nevertheless she has appointed you cue of her executors.” “ In that case I will do my best to carry out her wishes, of course,” replied Air Aloore, not expecting serious complica tions from such" a very limited estate. “ Alay I ask who is the other?” “I am,” Mr Lawson replied. “Yon see I know all about her affairs.” “ Exactly,” the vicar said. “ The funeral is to take place on Thur.s day, I believe?” further observed Mr Lawson. “ Yes; lam anxious to have everything settled as soon as possible, for my daugh ter is very much out of health, and needs to be under her mother’s care. lam afraid the life here was a bad one for such a young girl.” “ I am afraid it was,” Mr Lawson said. “ Still I do not think she will regret hav ing come.” “ Not when she gets back her strength, I dare say, but at present she is in such' a weak, depressed state, I must own. I feel rather anxious. I should have fetch ed her away long ago if I had had the least idea of what she was going through. She came from a poor home, I daresay, but it was always a cheerful one, and a ‘ dinner of herbs’ is always satisfying ‘ where love is.’ However, Ido not wish to judge Aliss Aloore now she is gone,” he added quickly, “ only,” with a little break in bis voice, “I cannot look at my poor child without terrible misgivings; she is so much altered.” “AVell, you see, it-has been a very painful experience for her, but young people pick up so quickly. Give her change of air, and plenty of amusement, and she will be as spry as ever. That’s what she wants,” be added, with convic tion. “ I know by my own girls. They never mope or get out of health wheu there, is a ball or a foreign trip in pros pect.” ’ Mr- Moore did not feel very sanguine somehow, but as be did not pare to dis cuss : the subject further with a stranger, he held his peace, and soon after Air Law son took his leave,. , Margaret had not expected to sleep that: night, in spite of: the draught Dr Lethbridge had sent her, but she was so utterly worn out she. was fast off as soon as her hea'd touched the pillow.'. The candle guttered itself out at. dawn, leav ing an unpleasant smell and a long wind ing-sheet behind, but even this' did not rouse her, and she was surprised to find it was 9 o’clock when she, at last, woke up. Air Moore had finished his break fast some time, when she got down, and was strolling about the garden under the shade of the trees; but he came in direct-; ly he saw her through the open window, and asked-her for a'cup'of tea sis an ex- v cuse for bearing her company.' As soon as she had finished her scanty meal, he made her fetch her hat and come with him for a stroll, judging it better ! she should be . out of the distressing at mosphere of .the Grange as much as pos sible. No woman, however, tender, could! have been wiser or more judicious than he, for he had that’ wonderful intuition and taut which you find in all sympathe tic natures. ;■ He talked of Summerleigh until she not only listened, b.ut even- asked ques tions; and. though .the shadow fell upon her again as they re- entered the Grange, he was mora hopeful that he had yet beep, for ho thought fie knew where'it' came from now,' and-believed she would right herself when she had left Lynside be hind. : He had arranged forth'em to take their departure directly after-the-will had been read, although;thejr’could not reach home until : late,. a®'he'',Uas careful; that Alar garet_saw as little, of ; tfie funeral ;prepara tions as possible in. the meantime.: -He even fr'inf the sinallA ihopjiin, the village;., she had never thought.-bf; it- herself, ho ’• ing '■ But she.put’it ; ou"withoiitanyremark when Hannah-’ took it up into - her ’room on Tlujsday-'morrnttg.’:;'' Fit and 'style were both' equally: bad ?ii of vepuise; ~bht Margaret’smatjjraT advantages;Ariinnph - ed over such :drawbaeks ev6n as this/ and she looked like a young j queen as; she came down-the staira, -Mr Moore- decided with, pardonable pride. ::, • He’had dreaded‘a.breakdown- at. the fufieral;' but she .was quite'-calm, to cs great relief, and showed of emo tion but,, once, and that • was- when: the earth fell with a dull rattle on: the coffin; lid. “Dust to dust, ashes to. ashes,” said.the clergyman solemnly,. and.then.

Mr’ Lawson knows all Miss Moore’s affairs'.” . “Thank you,” said the lawyer, radi antly. “I can assure you I will do the best I can in every way .for my client I should propose, if--agiceahle-.to vou,. that Hannah Wilson, remain here in charge of the house : whilst'you areaway, and have someone to keep her company if she likes. You can give her board wages, and I think it will be a very st-'t able.and convenient arrangement, if Han nah does not object.” “No, sir, I should like it,” replied• Hannah, who had been weeping abun dantly ever since she heard of her an nuity, “and Til have Jim’s eldest girl with me, if you don’t mind, Miss, and try and drum some sense into her,” she con cluded, “as a make-up, yon know.” There.was something very pathetic to Margaret in Hannah’s-faithfulness to tfie love of her youth. She had given him up to please her mistress, but her heart had never once swerved from its allegiance; and though he had been dead and gone for ten years, now her first thought,, on' finding herself provided for so liberally, was to do something for Jim’s children. Hannah was pleased at her young mis-: tress’s cordial acquiescence in the plan, and would fetch Maria that very evening, she said; though she scorned'the,idea of feeling afraid, even if she wefe alohe in tho.house. : ■; , “Neither ghosts nor burglars will harm ine,” she said, “ and.if poor mstress'did come back I should be very, glad to see. her and thank her for what she, has done for me.” Soon after, this, Mr -Lawson took, .

All Margaret’s correspondence since she Returned; home had 1 been from Mr Law-' Sony, and every' one of these letters- she .had handed fto’her father as a. matter .of course. 'When, therefore, she -'thrust Hannah’s, into her pocket and' got : up quickly and left the 'tablej with-a'face'as white as death, tlie elder members of the family .exchanged glances of surprise and .consternation..' - ' “ I liope there is-no bad news,”- sighed Mrs Moore, who, like all people who have had a long struggle, was almost afraid to enjoy the relief when-it,came. - “Ho go and see what is the matter, Helen.” “ I think she would rather be alone for a, few minutes, mamma,” answered He len, wisely. “If you don’t mind, I’ll go presently.” • ' ' : “I do.hope the lawyer. hasMi beard of. another will revoking the: ohe that lef- ; everything ..to Madge,” continued - Mrs Moore, looking.pale and .frightened.' : “ Gome,'my love,it isii’tlike you to be a Job’s comforter,” said'iltHe vicar, re-_ proachfully. - “ Madge heard from him -By the. second post yesterday, .and-it was all right then. .

It is very sad, too, since she will have to live jbere.” “ She will get over it by degrees,’.’lMrs Moore observed. “And then when shi is married-^— “She never will marry, mamma, Lain quite sure,”interrupted Helen, gravely. “ Do you mean. that she has broken en tirely with Dick? L have not dared *0 ask, she looked so distressed once whev I mentioned his name. If she has given him up, she must have a very good rea son, for there never was anyone less mer cenary thau Madge.” . - “ Nurse says she ought to marry a duke now,” put in Florence, who was ten years old, and had ears like the proverbial pit cher. “ I heard her tell cook she wpuldu t look at anything less'if she had a face, and a fortune too.” " V “ But perhaps Madge hasn’t nurse’s tastes,” said Mr. Moore, with iridiilg nt irony. “And then, of:course, we don’t know'any. dukes.”. 1 -Ten minutes later they all dispersed. Miss Tudor/their governess, was coming up the carriage drive., • Helen was 18, and only went to the schoolroom for her music lessons • the two eldest boys stu died with their father. But Willie was going to a, well-known, crammer for' sir months, and Lawrence.- was' destined for a public school: so. that the, vicar felt himself free and .able.to give jnpre time to Ms parish and correspondence. •He was in ■ the middle of a letter half an hour later, when'a shadow darkedvd th,ie window/ which opeiied-on to the lawn, and Margaret came in.

" She - looked up and welcomed Margaret \- with' a smile as she approached, but the smile faded quickly when the other t-old her errand... ’ - _ “.Must you?” she said wistfully. “Yes, I must,” she answered with a slow, pained voice. : “Is it anything you heard this morn in- that has influenced you?” “Yes,” she almost whispered. And now she seemed actually to shrink as if someone were touching a bare wound. “Then there is nothing more to be said. lam sure you would not leave us so soon if you could help it.” • “ No, indeed.” - - - .Mrs Moore gulped down a- little lump in her throat, then'she said bravely, “ I will go and speak to Miss Tudor at once, dear. You will look after. Baby for me, won’t you ? Above all' things, keep him away from the laburnum trees, or he will eat the seeds,” she looked back to add as she was half-way across the lawn towards the schoolroom. Florence clapped her hands With de light at the idea of going'to Lynside; she had never stayed away from home before in her life.' Miss Tudor seemed pleased, too'. She could quite well be ready, she said, if she went home at once, which was, of course, the best thing to do. Florence was in such rampant spirits, to have tied her down to French verbs would have been like chaining a butter fly to a cabbage stalk and expecting it to grovel when it wanted to soar. She made straight for Margaret direct ly.she was - released; - jumping all' the flower-beds in her way,, and when she had hugged her till she", was fain to call out for mercy she caught baby up and ca reered round and round the' lawn with him until , the garden rang with his glee ful cries and shrill childish laughter. : And so having worked off the first exu berance of;her spirits, she could sit down composedly when dinner-time; came, al though ev.ery now and- then a,soft little ripple; of -'laughter broke' irrepressibly from her. lips;, and excited the resentment of, the; younger; ■toys', - -who; thought • she; was crowing over, .them because she. was going to Lynside and they were not. But Margar et reminded "them-that they would' be coming. at ChristmaSj-jand wouldhave plenty of.fnn at school .in.the. mean time, and-so the clouds rolled away. : ‘ Margaret'herself' was- almost cheeeful now that everything was settled for :her departure on .the. morrow,; hut not for the world would she have missed the early train; and the moment she. had finished her - dinner .she went upstairs--:, to. pack.
