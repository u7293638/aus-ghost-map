THE PROPOSED NEW DUTIES ON GLASSWARE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,—In the s.s. Echuca we have some cheap vases such as are used by the poorer classes and are ordinarily retailed at about 2s. per pair. The case measures over all 111ft., and thus the duty at 1s. per foot will be £5 11s. The goods are actually invoiced (for the case) £4 4s., and the other charges without the duty amount to £5 14s. so it will be evident that these goods will cost nearly 400 per cent to import, and if this is not prohibition we should much like to know what is. In the same ship we have some tumblers, with just the ghost of engraving on them. Each case measures 23ft. The duty at 2s. 6d. per foot will be £2 17s. 6d. per case, and the invoice price of each case is £4 3s. 4d.; other charges, without duty. £1 12s. 9d. These tumblers are what were usually sold at 6s. or 7s. per dozen wholesale, and they now cost 7s. to 7s. 6d. to import. It will be many years before vases or cheap engraved glass- ware can be made here ; in fact it is very doubtful if ever they will be made here at all. The proposed new duty is not likely to bring in much revenue if other importers act as we purpose doing, that is, to cease importing such goods for the future. Should anyone doubt the truth of what we now assert, we shall be happy to show how the various charges and duties are made up on the lines we now mention. —Yours, &c.;, LAZARUS, ROSENFELD, and BENJAMIN. 283 Lonsdale-street east, Oct. 3.
