What he wanted to say was that it the book could do 'all that he had stated, distributed as it was all over the known world, then the institution which sought thus to distribute the bible deserved their sympathy and support. He appealed to the intelligence of the audience whether that was not an object worthy of support. No matter whether the society was prosperous or not, the object was suflic?ent to call out their most earnest. support. (Applause). Mr. W.

The lo v. Francis Tait moved thie first resolution as follows: That the report lon read, together with tisa resasre,'s bla?e?-cisheet, be aloplted, sad printed In the usal form, under the dlrecton of thie ssnailtee for eirculatlon. it afforded him very great pleasure to be there that evening, and to ie able, by his presence on the plot. form, to indicate his sympathy with the British and Foreign Bible Society, and his desire for extending its usefulness. It never rquired mtuch arguing in addressing an audience on behalf of that society. They had so many societies now of one sort or another that he sympathised with the manwhole once formed a society whose object should be to prevent the formation of any more societies. (Laughter). But his objection did not extend to the British and Foreign Bible Society.., Many of them knew that lie had tle boner of spending the first ten years of his ministerial life in mlissionary work. And as tile society was named the British and Foreign Bible Society, and as he was the only gentleman on the platform who had boen privileged to take part in foreign work, he would speak of the Bible in Fiji. The Bible has been the handmaid of missionary entewrprise, aod by its aid ditllcultioe had been removed which would otherwise have been inanr. motlntablu. In glowing words hei tnid of the great change whlch lhad been wrought eince the first mis. sionaries landed in Ffjl with the bible in their hands, and taught of it simple truths.' ?oe related the diflciultrle these men had to fight against; how they reduced the, spoken language of Fiji ,to -a written language afer mouths of labour. Now the bilble was read in Fiji, and there was no part of the world lie said where the bible was read more extensively than in Fiji. He agreed with the remarks of the chairman about the bible being able to do good work without the aid of teachers. The good done by the bible in Fiji was beyond all description. 'People landing there now would fined a copyof the bible on every table, aisd they would be welcomed to the island, They would not hiav fared so well twenty. five years ago. Ha liad much pleasure in moving the resolution,. (Applause)., Tihe leu, G1.:'M. DoArcy Irvine sceonded the re solution, andsad hlie rejoiced' that at this his first appearance on a Coulburn. platform hle Ihad to speak i tlloe Interest of that great society whiose objcet was the circulatidi of the sacred scriptures throughout the world.

The gospel was holy-it was the holy gospel. All its doctrines were holy. He would take one of them that which was the basis of all the rest-the doctrine of the atonement. Did not this set forth God as a Being infinitely hating sin and infinitely.,loving holiness ? (Hero the rev.'sepakerreferred to Arch bishop Magee's work on the Atonement) :Were nott the promises a holy 7. Look at the charactera tot whom these promises were given. " All things will work together for good to those who love God." "Likeas a father pitieth his own children so is the Lord mercilul to them that fear Him." " The Lord God is a sun and shield, the Lord?sill givegraceands glory; no good thing will Ue withhold from themo that walk uprightly." Then look at the precepts of the gospel. Contrast these with the babe selfishness of the world. How powerful the contrast! How does the shade seem to darken in contrast with the brightness of the sun I "Be kindlyaffectioned one to another, in honour preferring one another; not slothful in business 1 fervent in spirit, serving the: Lord; rejoicing in hope, patientin tribulation, con tinuing instant in prayer, distributing to the neces sity of the saints; given to hospitality; bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not; rejoice with them that do rejoice, weep with them that weep., Be of the same mind one towards another; mind iot' high things,' bhut 'ondscesnd"to men of low' estate." All these precepts were holy, evincing the holiness of the God.who indited them.- How could he speak of:.the great:'ahd glorious Word Iniself ? Even Voltaire preferred the character of our blessed Lord to his own hero Socrates -ind well ,he might, for our Lord Jesus Christ: was His own gosp)e em bodied-Ho was Himself the living 'example and proof of all its holy doctrines, promises, and precepts.: To his (the speaker's) mind the holiness of the scriptures was the best and brightest proof of their inspiration. (Applause.)' From, their holiness might, be deduced at once their divine ,authorship;. What other conclusion could be drawl ,? Did the world indite the scripti '*r Why; the scriptures denounced the world, condemimed the world, opposed the world, rejected the' world; aniad yet the world indited them I This wpuld~ be to spposo an effect greater than its cause-nay, it would be to suppose an effect in direct opposition to its cause. .This. would be using words'that convey no notion--this would be using language that wbuld violate the first principles of reason.. The holiness of the scriptures to his mind was as clear an evidence of their having been inspired by the Holy Ghost as any moral evidence possibly could be-something of the same kind of demonstration as if a man at broad mid.day were to ask "how do you know that to be a sun ?" The answer would :he "because I see it." Lot them then unite in one holy plialanx to give the holy scrip, tures increased circulation in. the world. If they desired that their fellow.creatures, should become holy, loving, piaceable, and prepared'for time and for eternity, let them unite more and more in this one holy resolve at least, that as far as in them lay the word of the Lord qhould have free oourse and be, glorified. (Applause). ' . - J ' The resolution was put to the meetling and carried unanimously. - - - .-... The 11ov. T. B."

They said that the society lhonours God's word because it, believes in tihe effllicacy of that word and believens that it hasl a power which cat do its own work. Another reason why they should support tie society was becatu:s it had onen distinct aism, and that was the circulation of God's word. lelo hal heard it obljected to on the grounds that every church shtould be a biblo society and that every church should aidt in the circulation of God'n word. Andlf f every cliurceh did its dtty in tlhart rmater thleres would be no lneed for sruch a society. Now inl tihe very face of thiligs thley could soee the albsurtlity of sruch snlt objection.

The society was putting the bible into the hands of men and women all over the world and showing them the way to heaven and teaching them to be Christiais. it was putting the bible into the hands of every child in Fiji and bidding him read it every week-day and every Sunday. But what were they doing amongst their own people? "Why, they were taking thebibleoutof theirschoolsoneveryhand. (Cont sion and cries of no, n?, an?d question!) He' wa very sorry to Lear the cries of 'no." Hemaintained that the bible as a whole was being taken away from theiirchildreii lie ?it'ply said this, that in England, in Australia, their, own Christian children in their schools were not in the same position as those children in those schools where they had the bible in their own hands. (Oh ! Oh !) He was bound to say that they were by meais of legislation about to take the~bible.out of the hands of the children in their owd schools. Was it because they did not love the bible? No; it was because they as Christians differed and did not pull together that the bible was to be taken from them. They had been ac cused of bibliolatry.: Those who" supported the Bible Society, who loved the bible and reverenced it, ..had been accused of bibliolatory. . After referring to the. work done, on the continent and in America, he said that the time would come when Christians would be able to agree on some method which would make these schools in the highest sense of the word Christian schools. He had pleasure in seconding the resolution. Carried unanimously. The1 Bev.

SMr. A. i. Betts seconded the resolution. They had heard, and it was to the credit of that auxiliary that they had been able'to'seud a largo contribution home during the past year, and they know that the main part of the credit was duo to the ladies who had collected the money, and in particulai to the ladies of Taralga. (Applause.) He would asi them to be cordial in their thanks to the secretary, the oev. A. d. Tait. He himself had hail the pleasure of occupying thoe position 6f secretary, and hlie kInoew tihe amount' of work whlihl the secretary had to do. Thlley had got into a state of disorganization before Mr. 'Tait took- the secretaryship; but under his efforts they had booen put right again, and he trusted that during the present year they might be able to suild a- larger sum to the paretnt society than they had done in the past. (Cheers.) The motion was put and carried unanimously. A collection was here taken up. Mr. F. It. L. Rossi moved and Mr. W. S. Foxall seconded a vote of thanks to Mr. W. Davies for presiding. Carried unanimously. Mr. Davies, in reply, after a few remarks about his business taking him a good deal away from G3ulburn, said in allusion to what hlid fallen from the Archdeacon, that he was afraid he had been doing very wicked things of late, and Ihe did not know whether lo ought to plreside at the Bible Societies' meetings or not. lie had been teaching the bible as a class book for twenty-live consecutivo years, (applause,) iuid he would give way to no mant in his intense admiration of and thorough conviction of the nccessity for bible teaching in conneoxion with young pesople. No one could exceed hiit ihn his intense admiration of the Ibilon as a claess.blok--in its proper placeo. (Loud cheers.) But, as lie had observed before, it was his impression that his own children got enough of doetlatie and polemical theology in this Sunday-school and in his own home. (Applauso.) And he waits uro that if Ihe was to attempt to dose theol with any more of it, it would exceed what they could taklt. After referring to the groat work accomplishd 1by the bille, lie concluded by saying that wherever they could got tlio Iilelo iq let them get it, and if the friends of the bible bming taught as a whole, in the public schools could manago to persuade the pleople of this country that theirs was the right view of the case, during the noext three years, in God' na t them o let the do o. Hoe would say amenion to what the people said. (Cheers.) The doxology havinig been sung, Canon Soares pronounced the Ioenediction andt the lceting secpa rated.
