ACCOUNT OF AN EYE-WITNESS. Mr. John Piper, dyer, of Hyde Park, who saw the whole of the affair, claims to have been the means of separating the Premier and Mr. Sparks. ''I was proceeding through the square,' lie said, 'and I saw Mr. Kingston and Mr. Boothby walking towards the_ Post Office, Suddenly Mr. Sparks, whom I didnot recognise at tirst, for he was wearing a little cap, which is most unusual for hun, appeared on the scene, and approaching tlie Premier from behind dealt him a blow near the left ear, with what I thought was a stick. The biood immediately spurted out rrom the wound and Mr. Kingston appeared quite dazed. He turned round, however, and ' went for' Mr. Sparks. Mr. ISoothby for the moment seemed dumbfounded, and thinking that the assault was a most cowardly one and that the Premier had been taken at a great disadvantage, I got between them and was really tlie means of stopping the atfair. I said to Mr. Sparks, * Weli, you have lowered yourself,1 and he replied 'Yes, lhave.' Thereupon he hailed a cab and disappeared. Now if it had been a fair hand-to- hand fight I would not have interfered, and should have been auiu^jd, though I think Mr. Sparks is in bettor trim for that sort of thing than Mr. Kingston ; but to see a man stunned in that way — it can be called nothing but 'cowardly' — raised niy auger. Mr. Sparks's usually ruddy complexion was as white as a ghosts. Mr. Boothby seemed so surprised at the affair that he took no more action in the matter than Hercules in the square, but seeing as 1 did the \vhol« thing from the start it made mv Llood boil.'
