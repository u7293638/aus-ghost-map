PYRMONT PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. The foundation-stone of a new church at the corner of Quarry-street and Crown Road is as hid on Saturday afternoon in the presence a large number of the ministers, officers and members of the Presbyterian body The proceedings commenced by the singing of the 100th Psalm, after which the Rev J Adam, Moderator, engaged in pi Tyer the Rev Dr Fullerton addressed the audience, and alluded to the pleasure it gave him to take part in the proceedings not only from his connection with the communion, but because he was originally a trustee of the land on which the building would be erected He and Dr Hamilton were the trustees for the land under the will of the late Mr Tim is, who had devised certain land for the benefit of the church When the union of the Presbyterian bodies took place and the old Synod of Australia lapsed in the present arrangements, the trusts under the old Synod were transferred by special legislative enactment to the General Synod now in existence, and hence the latter considered that the land on which they stood should pass into the hand of the minister and congi egahon now won shipping 11 the wooden chair in the vicinity Some exception had been taken to the change of Mac, but the fact appeared that the pic at position I was in a central, and as that might lead to its benefits being more widely taken advantage of, it was as well that the range was made He only trusted that its advantages would be appreciated, and that it would prove a blessing in order that the action of the trustees jinuhtbetlnilj undertook Mr Walker would lead them the clause in the enactment which certified to the legality of the a vessel of the trust Mr Walker here, lead the clause in question The Rev Mr Paterson, minister of the Pyrmont Presbyterian Church, then addressed the company as follows -This church is being elected by the Presbyterian congregation that worships in a wooden building situated in Harris-street, Ultimo, and on land which was bequeathed long since for church purposes by the late Mr John Harris, of Ultimo, for the occupying of which ground the sanc- tion was obtained of the acting trustee, the Rev. Dr Fullerton, and also of the supreme com- t of our Church Thus it is to be in connection with the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales-a Church that is founded upon the Word of God, and agreeable thereto Its mode of government being Piosbytenan is well calculated to conserve both order and liberty in the house of God , and its doctrines are in harmony with those of all the leading of Evangelical Churches in the world Within this sacred edifice, when it is finished, praise and prayer shall be offered up to the True God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost' whom we profess to worship, and Christian instruction, together with exhortations, shall be delivered, not with the view of educating and comforting God's people, and of converting sumers, turning them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God I bus, lines Church shall be dedicated to the promotion of the glory of Jehovah and the elevation and salvation of men The poor and often of the promoters of it shall be that it may be as a fount un of hung water in a parched land, whither the weary and tan say may appear, dark, and be refreshed, that it may be further the source of holy, pin dying, existing,

and that this sacred place may be such that our blessed Lord may sign supremely within its walls, and that we may be ivan granted in applying to this house, as we would to all genuine Churches of

"And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, to the work of our hands establish, thou it " The foundation stone of it is about to be laid by our dear friend, Mr John Hay Goodlet, who is well known and esteemed as a merchant of this city, and whose praise u in all the Churches especially in that of the Presbyterian Chun hot New South Wales in the name of our managers and congregation, I de sire to thank all who have favoured us with their presence here this day, and to tender our sincere thanks to the numerous friends who have by their subscriptions helped us to build up the walls of our Zion thus far, and we will confidently expect that the and others will render us still more as distance to enable us to complete what by the grace of God we have so well begun The hymn " O God of Bethel " was then sung, and Mr Goodlet was called upon to perform the ceremony of laying the foundation stone The Rev Mr Paterson handed him a very handsome silver how el, suitably inscribed, and a myall mallet, boJiauicles being supplied from the establishment of Ali El and Jones Mr Goodlet read a lengthy document, in which was set forth the day and date of the laying of the stone, the names of the minister and office bearers in the church, and those connected with the government of the denomination, which being deposited in a cavity in the stone, the same was laid with the customary formalities He then made a short address, which was heard with considerable difficulty, owing to the crowd, in which he thanked the officers for honouring but so far as to permit him to take the part he did It was a matter for congratulation that the members of the Church were in a position to undertake the erection of a more suitable place of worship, and he trusted that its benefits would not be lost sight of, but that all who had an opportunity of availing themselves of them would do save their own profit Moneys and cheque were laid on the stone by a very large number of persons, among them many children the whole amount being £94 12s. 3d. The building, when completed, will accommodate about 400 worshippers. It is of a Norman character, with a spire, and will be built entirely of stone from the adjacent quarries. The site is particularly elevated, and it should prove a great ornament to that part of Pyrmont, which needs some little architectural adornment. Sewage in Waters' series of instructive answers (says an English journal) relative to the influence of sewage in water in causing disease has been received by the Society of Arts in reply to a set of queries addressed by it to the various sanitary authorities. One hundred and one replies from as many different towns and cities form a little encyclopaedia of opinion and experience. Question No. 4 was--" Can you give any information from your own observation or sowage-polluled water spreading epidemic disease '¿" Out of the 101 answers no fewer than forty-four are in the affirmative ; some of these, however, appear to mean that the disease caused was] confined to those who drank the water, and did no spread further. The diseases principally observed as resulting from this cause were fever, typhoid, diphtheria, diarrhoea, nausea, and worms. Wells were the most frequent sources of infection sewage having soaked into them. From Warwick comes a remark of the observer there that in towns he has noticed the spread of epidemic disease has been more frequently traceable to faulty and unventilated drainage, or to private wells which have become polluted, than to the public water-supply. The reply from Willenhall corroborates this, as a district there formerly affected by typhoid has not been visited since waterworks took the place of a supply from shallow wells and sewage polluted streams. At Peterborough it is stated that the water supply is derived from wells " sunk anywhere." " For ten years," writes the observer, "who have not been without typhoid fever epidemic in parts of the town ; parts since supplied with good water are free." To the question (No. 0) whether water containing sewage from a district where there is no epidemic is injurious to health and if not injurious, to what extent it must be diluted, nineteen answers have been received. Of these, fifteen reply that polluted water, even when there is no epidemic, will cause a " general unhealthiness diarrhoea, dysentery, and gastric fever. Three say that it is not injurious, and the remaining one is to the effect that nothing definite is known. Of the three, however, which say that it is not two speak of water very largely diluted, as after downward intermittent filtra- tion on twenty acres of land, the effect of which was that the effluent water contained only one part in 200,000 of nitrates, and was drunk by the labourers without harm. Another observer, writing from Carlisle, though he thinks that no more than one grain of organic matter in 70,000 (or a gallon may be safe, yet says emphatically " we should inexorably prohibit any and every addition of sewage to water which is or may be used for drinking or for cookery. Lot no idea of dilution delude us." No more terribly significant statements have probably ever appeared in as condensed a form and from so wide an area. Almost everywhere the water polluted with sewage caused disease, which was absent from places provided with good water. What an immense amount of preventable suffering do these facts imply ! The grave of M'Gahan, the brave correspondent is in the Catholic cemetery of Ferilceui, described as " a wilderness of utterly neglected graves, tangled over with and half buried in wild weeds and uncared for shrubs Lady Strangford, who was his firm friend in life, has planted in the soil about the grave honeysuckles, white jessamine, roses, and pansies. Regret is felt that he was not buried in the English cemetery at Scutari, under the cypresses near the waters of the Bosphorus, where many Englishmen were buried in old war times. The Russians affirm that the total amount. of the expenditure incurred on the part of their Government "'' for war purposes is 98S 000.00 roubles.
