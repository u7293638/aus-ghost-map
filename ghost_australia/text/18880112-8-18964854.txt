A Fight for Nothing. About a mile from Fort Pillow wo met three coloured men and a team of horses. The horses were hitched to a dead mule, and were " snaking" bim off for burial, but just then had come to a dead halt. The mon were wrangling in loud and earnest voices, and as we halted to see what was go- ing on one of them explained "Yo Bee, gem'len, dis yere mulo died of heart disease." "Didn't do nulfin' of de sort!" disputed the second. " If dat dere mule didn't hev a chill an' jist friz hiaself to death den I'm a gonner. " Chill !" yelled a third. " Gen'len, dat mule wuz old miff to die, an' he jist heeled ober an' dat's all dar am to it. Heart disease ! Chill ! Why dem two niggers neber seed a mule afore las' y'ar." "Junius, doan' you go to puttin'on airs ober me !" threatened the first, who was driving the team. " You is a low down nigger from de bot- tom lands, an' dose white men doan' take no stock in sich." The colonel advised peace, but Junius bristled up with : " Low-down nigger ! Bottom lands ! Why fo' de Lawd, but I has allus lib'd on de mountains an' as fur bein' a bad man, I baa got twenty-two " papers from de werry best white folka to ahow who I am!" " Reckon you lio, sah !" "Who's aliar?" " Yes, who's a liar ?" Thero was a triangular fight. Each man went in on his own account and fought the other two. They were still at it when the dead mule rolled over, raised his head, and after a moment got upon his feet and began to eat leaves from a roadside bush. Our laughter stopped the fracas, and each darky stood still and looked at that mule as if he had been a ghost. Then they looked at each other with blank faces. Then up at us with open mouths. * We rode away before they had spoken a word, bnt presently the leader shouted after us " Bless my soul, but he's done come to life, an* wo's had dis yer fout for nuffln."
