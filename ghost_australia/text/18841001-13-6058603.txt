The storm aroused in Germany by Prince BISMARCK'S announcement of a new colonial policy had far from abated when the mail left Europe We can only hope that it had reached its height, for the tone adopted by the German pt less would, if continued, So far from favourable to international goodwill, but the cable message published this morning, that Prince BISMARCK is form ing a league hostile to further British annexations is ominous in character The report may be a false alarm, but it indicates that excitement still prevails on the Continent The immediate cause of offence is the action taken by the Cape Colony in connexion with the new German Lettie most of Angra request On the 11th July Lord Di RBY forwarded a telegram to the Governor of the Cape, intimating that Urn MAJXSIVS Government had determined that they were not in a position to oppose the intention of the German Ministry to extend protection to Angle request, but that they will " be prepared to proclaim under British " protection and authority any other " places on the coast to the southward " to which British subjects have claims, if the colonial Legislature will make arrangements as to cost" Immediately on receipt of this communication the Cape Government proclaimed the annexation of Walfisch Bay and the adjoining territory, so as to stop a further advance towards its bounds The news occasioned general outburst of indignation in Germany The official Nov (11 German Goetze argues at length that British colonies are subordinate to the British, Crown, no matter how much local liberty of action may be allowed them by the mother country 'The article concludes -"The German Government will not " be disposed to regard as merely for " various incidents what has occurred " in this particular, namely, the at " tempts made to hamper the German " colony of Angora Request, and her " medically seal it up against the outer "world These attempts, displaying " as they do a mean unfriendliness to " wards a friendly nation, must by " international law be regarded as the " action of the Bl Irish Government, in " asmuch as the latter has not met " tried to prevent them " The Gazelle is mildness itself, however, in comparison with less responsible journals Anglophobia trades are frequent and bitter, one writer in the Allgemeine Zeitung suggesting that the English would probably see their way to singing a very different and much humbler song were they but once made acquainted with the tactical formations of the German army, and with the effects of the German file firing a more insulting threat, says 'The Innes correspondent at Bet lm, never appeared even in the French press when it was woik»ngupthenat»onalfurypiiortolb70 'The Times for its part declined to accept the vituperations as a chief son of German public opinion, 01 even of the Chancellor's private mind " those " habits of discipline, it says, " which " appear so admirably in the German " array have never been conspicuous in " the tactics of German newspapers " which profess to support the Govern ment. T less journals are singularly | '' prone to mistake the word of com- " maud, to march out of stop, and no " here at allies instead of enemies. " HAOHLANDER, in one of his military " novels, tells a story of a King of " Prussia who remarked in a review " that a soldier had stumbled ; but by " the time this mild observation, " passing through a dozen officers! " mouths, reached the wretched soldier, " it had been distorted into a severe " condemnation of the whole regiment " for their bad marching. It is much " the same with the symptoms of Prince " BISMARCK'S impatience or irritation, " which get exaggerated in their transit '' from paper to paper until they reach! " proportions never contemplated by " the Chancellor himself." The angry comments of the German papers have had a powerful effect, however, in inducing both parties in England to urge upon the Government the necessity of strengthening the fleet, so that the national invincibility upon the waters may be placed beyond a doubt. It is noteworthy, and the fact must be recorded with patriotic pleasure, that at the mention of danger, Conservative and Liberal began to draw together. On the other hand,, journal so friendly to the Gladstone Government as the Spectator is compelled to admit that what has provoked the displeasure of the German Chancellor is the weakness of the colonial policy of the English Ministry. The Angra Request papers were pigeon- holed for months. England proposes to govern large parts of South Africa, and does not govern. She establishes protectorates in Australasia, and they are names. The Chancellor, we are told, has a contempt for such weakness. All this is very disquieting. And the regret is deepened that the Colonial Office did not see its way to accede to the Australian application when it was first made. The Cape Colony, it will be seen, has been treated far more kindly by Lord DERBY than we have been. The permission given to the Cape Government to annex such territory as it required at its own cost is the exact concession we have asked for but what the Cape obtains easily at a crisis was absolutely denied to us when there was no risk whatever. All that Australia demands could have been granted without any chance of an accusation of a desire to shut out a German colony, for there was no German colony to shut out, while the action of the Cape Government was undoubtedly liable to be described as invidious in character. It must be intended to stop German extension, and was consequently very likely to arouse German wrath. The curse of the timorous man is that he is in variably rash in the wrong place. The agent-general who are on the spot are of opinion that ViQ should not relax in pressing our claims to the islands at this juncture, and doubtless they are right Unless we keep Lord DLRRY up to the mark, he may surrender everything On the other hand, it is not unlikely that the Colonial Office, it properly in structed from here, could come to an understanding with Prince BISMARCK on the basis of a liberal recognition of all German land purchases in the sales up to date It is the ill advised threats of the Western Pacific Commission to annul land purchases that have provoked the fears of the German traders, and it should be possible to reassure our 'Teutonic friends on this point Germany can scarcely wish to create many colonies in these waters, for the all sufficient reason that they would be so many prizes for the French navy in the event of a renewal of hostilities between the two countries Just as, in the old days, England picked up the French colonies, so would France be able to secure those of Germany whenever, as in 1870, she was able to sweep the seas and there are consequently solid reasons why the scattered German trading stations in these waters should be placed under the protection of some friendly power which would guarantee the titles Such an assurance it is our interest to give Our way may not be so clear as it was, but apathy or a lack of assertion on our part would destroy our romance for ever. The venerable fallacy that people can be made sober and virtuous by a legislative enactment, resembles that wooden headed ghost which is continually being cudgelled to death in a Punch and J udy show No sooner is the grotesque phantom laid low by the hunchback s baton, than it springs to an erect position again, as if to invite another blow which is to lay it once more prostrate There is no vitality or nationality in the spectre Its resistance is attributable to sheer insensibility And so with the fallacy we have just spoken of If we were to investigate its origin, we should probably be able to trace it to a superstitious belief in the minds of a small number of uninformed people, that human laws are omniscient in design and omnipotent in operation, and that moral progress and social purity may be obtained by the multiplication of statutes and by their rigorous en for cement A belief of this kind is not merely erroneous in theory, but is at variance with all experience No here have experiments in the direction of making people temperate by legal compulsion been tried under conditions more favourable to success than in the United States, and nowhere have they i i r i mi _ C. proved more signal failures. The most conclusive evidence upon this point has been furnished by Dr. D10 LEWIS. That gentleman has been for 40 years a consistent advocate of total abstinence. He holds that alcohol is a poison when taken in any form or under any circumstances and he has made large pecuniary sacrifices in the cause of temperance. Nevertheless, he '\ pronounces prohibitory legislation to be I the one great obstacle in the path of s temperance reform, and declares that '. further progress in that direction is impossible, so long as that legislation is in force. " Our enemy," he asserts, " can be conquered only by social and " moral weapons, and to call attention " away from these agencies, and fix it " upon the constable, is a fatal blunder." The constable has been had re- course to in more than a dozen of the United States, and most of them have found out that they have made a grievous mistake, Massachusetts abandoned prohibition after giving it a trial of twenty years. In Maine there has been an alarming increase of drunkenness and of arrests for drunken brawls, the reason being that private drinking clubs have been every- where established, and that these have proved to be more fascinating and mischievous than were the publichouses in which liquor was openly sold. Turning to the mother-country, we find it stated, on the authority of Mr. J. T. AGO-GARDNER, in the Fortnightly Review, that the Sunday-closing Act has actually increased the evils it was intended to diminish. It has been in force for six months in the Princi- pality of Wales, and the inspector of police at Cardiff states that there has been an increase of 40 percent, in the number of persons proceeded against, and of 60 per cent, in the number of persons convicted, as coin pared with the corresponding period of the previous year. Similar testimony comes from South, Etiabon, and Wrexham and the teetotallers have been constrained by the force of events to come forward and condemn Sunday closing. The mover of the first resolution at a public meeting of the St. David's Total Abstinence Society, held in Cardiff on the loth of April last, in alluding to the drinking clubs which had recently sprung into existence as one of the results of repressive legislation, remarked that "a more abominable " effect of closing publichouses on Sun " day he could not suppose possible ;" and he frankly admitted that although he had signed a petition in favour of that object, experience had convinced him of his error, " and I now feel," said he, " that no act of Parliament can " make people sober." A Roman Catholic priest, who seconded the resolution, confirmed the testimony of the previous speaker, and demanded the repeal of the act as essential to the' bringing about of a better state of things. "There is more drunkenness, " more sin, more iniquity of every kind " committed in Cardiff," said the reverend gentleman, " than ever there " was before." In Scotland, where for many years past, public-houses have been closed on Sundays, owing to the operation of the Forbes Mackenzie Act, convictions for drunkenness on the sabbath have increased 10 per cent, during the six years from 1877 to 1882, while in England, during the corresponding period, where no such restrictions were in force, there has been a decrease of 61 percent, in such convictions. But the statistics of drunkenness in Ireland are still more remarkable, and involve a severer condemnation of prohibitive legislation. " In 1872 and 1873, over " that portion of Ireland which is now " submitted to the Sunday Closing " Act, the number of arrests was " 118,291. In 1882 and 1883 this " number had increased to 137,385, at " the same time that the population i " was diminishing." Nor is it possible to disconnect the effect named from the cause specified for there are five cities in Ireland which are exempted from the operation of the measure and in these places, during the same period, the number of arrests decreased from 60,621 to 39,638. Again, the arrests for drunkenness on Sundays within the exempted area have gone on steadily diminishing from 2,280 in 1878-to 1,280 in 1883. Thus it will be seen that legislation of a re- pressive character, instead of curing, aggravates the evils it is intended to remedy. Any law of this kind is attended with much the same consequences as would follow the conduct of a physician, who, being applied to by a patient suffering from some disease which betrayed its presence by an eruption on the surface of the body, should proceed to drive the disease into the system, instead of aiming at the eradication of its causes. The Sunday Closing Act in the mother country, like Closing Act in the mother country, like the Maine Liquor Law in America has not lessened drunkenness It has, on the contrary, increased it, only, instead of open indulgence, which could be kept in check by the police, there is an un mense amount of secret drinking, which seems to be all the more sought after because it is a forbidden enjoyment There are no stauncher friends of temperance than those to be found in the ranks of the opponents of local option, of rigorous Sunday ' closing, prohibition, and of such like attempts to interfere illegitimately with individual freedom of action and to legislate against vices o" infirmities as if they were crimes We only differ from the teetotal party as to the nature and employment of the weapons with which intemperance is to be combated We hold with Mr Ara GARUNTO, that it is not to be vanquished by acts of Parliament, but by " the creation of a healthy " standard of public opinion, combined " with the encouragement of self " control, of self reliance, and of " self respect " It was by these agencies that the drunken habits of the upper and middle classes of so ciety in Great Britain, which prevailed down to the end of the reign of Great IV, were gradually reformed and we have no reason to apprehend that the intemperance of the poorer classes will not disappear under similar influences " On the other hand, observes the writer just quoted, " the friends of local " option and of Sunday closing and " other kindred nostrums ask us to " bend to the gust of passion, to " abandon self control, and to lean on " the state for help and guidance It is not difficult to decide which of " these two methods is most in accord " ance with the English character " Mr. WALTER MADDEN succeeded yesterday in inducing the Assembly to adopt the principle that the licensee under the new Land Act may borrow money on registered licence lions." There could be no more complete re- versal of the old radical doctrine, that the settlor has no right to hire capital. A somewhat bitter experience has shown that the selector requires to borrow just as much as any tradesman does, and that if he is kept from reputable, he is driven to disreputable agencies. Mr. LONGMORE used to be fond of quoting instances of the arbitrary and grasping conduct of low-class money- lenders, and he and his friends utterly failed to see that they were driving the unfortunate selector into the hands of those greedy beings. Happily the Assembly is wiser now. Nearly every farmer's representative in the House on dorsed the new preposition, and Mr. MADDEN is to be congratulated upon having effected a valuable reform. The remainder of yesterday evening was mainly given to the crotcliot-mongere. Mr. A. T. CLARK, who is amusing himself this session by proposing catch or trap motions intended to put his follow members in a false position, put forward an impracticable clause of a dozen words declaring that all roads now closed should be thrown open. Such a clause would be inoperative, for there is no machinery in the bill to give effect to it. More declarations are worthless. And not even the most rabid supporter of the member for Williamstown asserted that all the roads of the colony can be opened. The old argument duly trotted out by Mr. CLARK, Mr. WOODS, and others of that clan, that large estates depopulate the country, is now seen to be worthless. The large estates exist because, unhappily, the population is limited, and cutting them up into half- acre allotments would not call another human being into existence here. The two VIEWS which found favour in the House were, first, that to arbitrarily open unused roads everywhere would be to man the local bodies, who would be answerable for any accidents which took place in gully, precipices, or crook, and, so condly, that when a road is not wanted by the public, those who use the grass growing on it should pay for the same The majority of 60 to 10 against Mr | CLARKES a hopeful sign of the times It looks as if the Ministry could deal with the unused roads question this session on the common sense basis of insisting that all roads required by the public, which the local bodies can open without peril to life and limb should be opened, and that the others should be leased on short term so as to put the local bodies in funds Thus the money obtained from one road would enable the council to form and open another Unhappily, it looks if the continued dawdling over the Land Bill will prevent the House grappling with any other subject of importance this side of Oil mt man In days of old, before the dawning of the present era of peace, prosperity, and a coalition Government, it seemed good in Mr BFRIU'S eyes that the tolls and toll gates of Victoria should be swept out of existence " In the light and airy fashion of the political HAROLD SKIM POLL, the agent of their destruction declared that the problem of discovering an efficient substitute to put in their place was one which he could solve in forty eight hours Years, however, have since elapsed, and the problem is a problem still Before Mr BERRY proposed it, the St. Kilda road was a credit to the community What is it to day 1 A stretch of broken and uneven surface, to carnage springs a terror, to coach mon a chronic excuse for bad language to city and suburban residents an eyesore and a perennial disgrace But to human endurance there is always a limit, and at length the members of the City Corporation have roused them only as to the conviction that this main line of approach to Melbourne must be put into a state of of decent repair Mr Alderman MURRAY R idea is that, upon it, Parliament, by special act, should authorise the erection of a special toll bar That, however, would be to revert to an antiquated system of road maintenance, which, in the vicinity of great cities, has been discarded all the world over As one of the deputation that waited on Mr SERVICE yesterday, Mr MOUBRAY contended that people who use a road should pay for keeping it in order Of course, this argument, though specious, is quite unsound It ignores the benefit to the city residents of traffic to and from their doors Yet, strange to say, no member of the deputation could see far enough beyond his nose to drag this lurking fallacy into the light of day To those, tolls are but a cheap method for providing an easily collected fund for road maintenance Mr Councillor CAIN suggested, it is true, that there should? be a road board, consisting of municipal representatives, with power to levy a special rate But this proposal, though sound in theory, com mandednoonthusnstic approval Finally, Mr SERVICE bluntly told his petitioners that granting Mr BrRitVsimpulsive aboli- tion of tolls to have been a mistake, it was now the duty of the municipalities, not of the Government, to suggest a substitute His good nature, however, induced him to add the promise that he would consult his Ministerial colleagues Better had he not given this pledge The responsibility of road maintenance rests with the municipalities, and sooner or later that responsibility must be faced To hold out to them even a shred of hope that Ministers or Parliament may ev mutually help them, is only to encourage them to " shilly shally" about the performance of the plain duty of helping themselves. Our cable messages this morning contain a rather startling announcement. It is reported that Prince Bismarck has arranged with the other European powers for the formation of a league for the protection of the unoccupied territory of the world against the aggression of England. The confirmation or other wise of such an important piece of intelligence will be anxiously waited for. The news brought by the Potosi, which is to the 29th August, states that a rumour has been current that an understanding exists between Germany, Austria, and France, the object of which is to satisfy the colonial aspirations of the three powers, and check the predominance of England. The following memo was received by the Telegraph Office last night from Singapore - " Both routes to Hong Kong have been interrupted from noon to day. Particulars later in the Legislate Council yesterday, the Removal of Doubts Bill was amended so as to restrict its operation to the interpretation of Crown grants Where the term Crown ' occurs it is to signify " Governor in Council Several additional witnesses were examined upon the Legal Professions Amalgamation Bill Mr Frank J Stephen, an attorney of 31 years' standing in Victoria, gave testimony against amalgamation, remarking that those who thought it would result in the reduction of law expenses were " very green " Amalgamation would be a retrograde step Judge NOLI, of the Insolvent Court informed the committee that the practice by which a solicitor appeared before him and conducted a case from beginning to end worked most satisfactorily, and saved the expense of retaining a barrister, and also the cost of preparing briefs, attending conferences, and advising In this respect it benefited both creditors and insolvents The compulsory division of legal labour caused additional expense, and he believed that many solicitors were as capable of appearing before the Supreme Court as barristers " Would not amalgamation result in the deterioration of the status of judges' ' asked Mr Ross " I see no danger of that,' responded Judge Noel, if those who had the selection of judges take care to choose none but fit men," a remark that provoked one of the very few bursts of laughter in indulged in by the Chamber during the sitting Mr John Hobbs, a contractor, who has had experience of law proceedings in Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia, where amalgamation exists, stated that it appeared to give satisfaction to the people. It was very convenient, but did not save expense Progress was then reported, and the House adjourned at 10 minutes past 9 till to day) Dr Kearney yesterday brought before the Legislative Council his motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to in- quireintooll matters relatingtorabhchealth The inquiry he desires is comprehensive We are surrounded by dangers The Yan Yean water is largely chargeable with the increase of hydatids and other terrible diseases. Vaccination with humanised lymph is responsible for the spread of consumption, struma, and contagious diseases of a virulent and devastating nature The effects of smoking and chewing tobacco on boys should be ascertained Colonel Sargood, speaking with the authority of the Government, asked the House to reject the motion To introduce new legisla- tion just as the central and local health authorities are becoming acquainted with their duties under the existing act would be any use Dr. Dobson suggested that if a commission were granted, it should be extended to an inquiry into the effect of long sentences with solitary confinement. In a recent case, the criminal was sentenced to 18 months' solitary confinement, the whole period covered by the sentence being 28 months. It is calculated to drive the prisoner into the hospital or the lunatic asylum, 'The debate was adjourned for a week The Legislative Assembly resumed the consideration of the Land Bill in committee yesterday. Mr. W. Madden's new clause, permitting the licensee to borrow money on them, after two years' occupation, was substantially agreed to As a safeguard, Ministers took power to make regulations (subject to the approval of Parliament) directing how the borrowing is to be effected. The lieu is to be no (available church upon (the lease, will the new i tor is entitled to after six years' occupation A lessee may mortgage without the sanction of the Minister Several new clauses dealing with the mining? difficulty were proposed, but withdrawn at the suggestion of Mr Kerferd, who said that the provisions inserted by the Government fully meet the requirements of the case Mr Connor submitted a proposal for the selection of three acre blocks in the vicinity of cities and towns. It was negatived Colonel Smith moved a new clause entitling the holders of miners rights to take up five acre allotments on gold fields without payment. Mr Mirams objected, unless the privilege was extended to all classes of mc charges Mr Kerferd showed that the clause would be unworkable 'The proper course is to increase the size of the " residence area " Mr. Kerferd reminded Colonel Smith of the vehement protests made but the other day by the cold fields towns against the fencing out of the miner, under provisions of this identical nature The clause was with drawn Mr W Madden carried a clause providing for the issue of grazing licences over vacant auriferous lands Some time was taken up in discussing fancy propositions, which, in the end, were either negatived or withdrawn At 1 o'clock this morning the bill was reported with amendments. The House then adjourned On the motion of Mr Shackell, a clause was inserted in the Land Bill providing that selectors may at any time obtain a Crown grant of 25 acres of their allotment for a vineyard or orchard The grant is to issue alter the land has been planted Mr Richardson proposed a series of new clauses to create a new method of selling suburban lands The land is to be valued, and disposed of in quarter acre lots, the up plicant having to reside, and the payments being extended over 10 years, or a shorter period, as the applicant may desire 'The proposal was negatived by 29 votes to 16 The closed roads question was brought to the front yesterday by Mr A 'B Clack, for the purpose of putting some of his radical friends in a difficulty He moved the insertion of the following new clause in the Land Bill "All roads in the colony now closed shall be thrown open for the public use 'The Chairman was minded to rule the clause out of order, as having no relevancy to the Land Hill, but the majority preferred disposing of the question by a division 'in two or three hon gentlemen were not prepared to vote without first placing their action clearly before the country Mr Mackay was shocked at the idea of the committee rushing to a division In some future election contest, he may be asked, " Did you vote against the clause for opening the closed roads and if he answers "Yes, he will be condemned without a hearing He has been served this way once already in connexion with the eight hours question. "That's just what Mr Clark wants," said an hon member In the view of Ministers the clause was un deserving of serious attention, because, if carried, it would not advance the question one iota. It is a question of local government Mr A. T Clark was pressed by several members of the same way of think ing as himself to withdraw his motion His heart was hardened. The coaxing even of Mr Bent, who professes to be one of Mr Clark s best friends, were of no avail Mr Clark said that if a majority voted for the clause he would throw on Ministers the responsibility of following it up with some effects e provision, and Mr Mirams promised to stand by the hon. member if he would go to a division Mr Gillies, in reply, pronounced the motion utterly out of place Mr Woods was of the same opinion, but so longed for the opportunity of forcing the land owners to fence their estates into 640 acre blocks that he could not resist voting for the clause The Werribee property-Mr Wood B favourite illustration-was imported into the debate Mr Anderson introduced immigration ' You want gutter sweepers cried Mr Woods ' We have more than enough of them already, said Mr Anderson, the farmers want intelligent ploughmen, who after a season or two will become farmers themselves The clause was negatived by 99 to 105 Mr 1 in cham, Mr D. M. Davies, Mr Dow, and Mr Bussell were numbered with the Clark Mirams party The Railway Construction Bill is to be in troduced in the Legislative Assembly in the course of a few days Mr Service stated yesterday that in the interval between the first and second readings the Mining on Private Property Bill will be brought forward The Railway Bill, however, is to take precedence as soon as Mr Gillies is ready to go on with it. Mr Service s announcement was received with cheers One of Mr Zox s standing subjects is the desirability of passing an act to prevent persons with means from imposing on charitable institutions Where they or their friends have money they ought to pay for the treatment they receive Yesterday, Mr Zox moved the adjournment of the House, to ascertain the views of the Government Ministers are questioned upon the subject every session, usually in Committee of Supply Mr Zox referred to the Bayne case, set forth in The Argus of Saturday Mr Kerferd said that the treasurer would try to effect some amendment of the law in the direction wished Amendments desired by Mr Cox in regard to other matters the date of holding elections for members of boards are to be inserted in the bill before the Leys lative Council the case of Mr Wollaston state school teacher at Campbelltown near Creswick, lined by the Minister of Education £6 for conducting a religious ser- see in the school building, was mentioned in the Legislative Assembly yesterday by Mr Lyneham. Mr Gillies, amid cheers from both sides of the House, justified the imposition of the fine Mr Wollaston, before the service was held, twice had his attention called to the wording of the Education Act which expressly forbids the giving of religious instruction by a state school teacher in a state school building He may hold a Sunday school or conduct service elsewhere if he pleases Mr Wollaston was fined for "gross disobedience, and under other circumstances might have been suspended. Several members dissented from Mr Gillies s reading of the law, but the feeling of the House, as expressed by cheers was decidedly with the Minister Mr Cooper gave notice of a motion affirming that on Sunday teachers shall have the same tree dom in matters of religion as other persons The bill introduced by Mr M H Davies and Dr Quick in the Legislative Assembly to amend the Printers and Newspapers Regis tration St Ltnte life has been for triumph Tin tration Statute 1864 has been circulated Its object is to enable companies owning newspapers to register At present the statute only takes cognisance of newspapers owned by " persons, and no machinery is provided for registration by a company The bill allows of registration in the name of the manager, managing director, or secretary It is to apply to existing as well as future Com panies The bill contains seven clauses. In 1879 a Melbourne newspaper, owned by a company, obtained a verdict against the then Premier for libel, but on appeal to the full Court the verdict was set aside, because the company owning the newspaper had not been able to register under the statute of 1861 A question of interest to persons taking up residence areas under miners rights was discussed in a partial manner u the Legislative Assembly yesterday Mr Burrowes, without notice, directed the attention of the Attorney-General to the case of a man named Wilson, who held land at Metcalfe near Taradale After he squatted on the land, it was exempted from occupation under miners right by proclamation Wilson refused to withdraw, and the local magistrates made an order for his removal Mr Burrowes, Mr M'Intyre, and others thought that Wilson had been harshly treated Mr Kerferd undertook to inquire into the facts, and give Mr Burrowes an answer to day Three Premiers who were present at the Sydney Convention have since left office, but their successors have cheerfully concurred in what was resolved upon by that body, and in the subsequent steps to which their consent was sought. Mr Colton, of South Australia, and Mr Stout, of New Zealand, some time ago signified their adhesion, but it remained for Mr Douglas, of 'Tasmania, to join with equal cordiality He had an opportunity of doing so upon Mr Services circular telegram requesting that the agents general should be instituted to renew the annexation agitation in London. The hon. gentleman was unable to reply earlier on account of the break in the Bass's Straits cable, but yesterday Mr Service received a communication from him of an entirely satisfactory nature He accepted the proposal without qualification and asked that the agent general for Victoria (Mr Murray Smith should be instructed to represent Tasmania also many action that may be taken Mr Service at once telegraphed to Mr Murray Smith requesting him to carry out Mr Douglas's wish In another communication Mr Douglas intimated that provision will be made on the estimates for 'Tasmania's share of the guarantee of £15,000 for the protectorate of New Guinea. [ With a view of securing uniform y in in intercolonial legislation on bills of exchange, Mr Service requested the Premier of Tas mania to insert a clause in a measure now before the Legislature of that colony, providing that "inland bills should include all b Hi operating through all the Australasian colonies Such a provision was made in an actpassidby the Victorian Parliament last session, and it is now the law in Queensland and South Australia. A reply has been re ceived from remains to the effect that the Government does not see its way to adopt the proposition They prefer to await the attainment of colonial federation for securing the end desired The Colonial Secretary of Western Australia has urged Mr Service to induce the Governments of all the colonies to come diately inform each other if cholera, small pox or other epidemic appear in their respective colonies, and to say whether scarlet fever and t) plans fever are now endemic there Mr Service has replied that he will gladly carry out the request The patients remaining in the sanatorium at Cut paw paw will be released in a few days and the local restrictions imposed at Ringwood, where small pox appeared some weeks ago will be at once removed It is now considered that the disease has entirely disappeared from the colony.
