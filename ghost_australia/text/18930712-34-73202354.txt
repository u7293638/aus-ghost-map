uyioxnsx. TO THE EDITOR. Sir— 'Hosier's Ghost Kb. 2' is a Ion? Jong way behind the times as to his information, or eke, aa I rather suspect, is drawing on his imagination for his facts. It seems almost childisb to contradict such absurd statements as he makes, and yet I suppose that there are some who otherwise would think they were correct. I defy him to name a single casein modern times — say in the last 50 years— in which a etrike has been decided a.nri nrrWci by *be leaders. In all cases it ia the men thera g9lvea who decide the matter, and too often aiaB ! in a way directly contrary to the advice and wishes of tbe leaders. The beautifol simplicity with which he acknowledges to having accepted as gospel what a Melbourne hotel waiter told him ehows how easily any one who got hold of him might etufi their goose, while tbe repulsive cowardice of the man is proved by the way in which he flings dastardly libels anonymously at a class cf self-denyiDg hard-working men whose shoes he is not worthy to bUckpn, and against no one of whom ho dares to bring any such ac cusation over his own name. — I am, &c;\\. JOHN K. BIEKS. Port, July 11, 1893.
