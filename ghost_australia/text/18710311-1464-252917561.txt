NEW VERSION OP THE GHOST SCENE IN HAMLET. (See Cartoon.) Hamlet (the Hon. J. Robertson,) loq. Speak ! I am bound to hear. Ghost (the shade of the late Hon. D. Egan,) loq. So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear. Ham. What? Ghost. I am thy ancient colleague's spirit, forced To walK all nignt in tnis patnetic guise Till the foul deed done to my helpless body Is purged by punishment away ; List, list, — Oh, list ! If ever thou didst thy dear honor love. Ham. 0 Lord ! Ghost. Revenge this cruel, most unnatural outrage. Ham. Outrage ? Ghost. Outrage most foul as in the best it is, But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. Now Hamlet hear, not that I find thee apt, But duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease, on Lethe wharf Didst thou not stir in this. Because 'twas urged By some mean-minded canting Pharisee That I like other men had had my sins, They came, who call themselves the servants of That awful Power, whose chiefest attribute j Is Love — long-suffering Love — and, in the dark, Dragged up my wearied body sanctified By immemorial Christian rites and made A holy thing through baptism of Death, And cast the helpless clay down some rude pit Dug by their hirelings' hands. Yea there I lie While outraged Sorrow vainly weeps and calls For justice in the ears of Apathy , And they who did this crime most horrible Are suffered to erect their "saintly " necks, And taint the air with puking platitudes. 0, Hamlet, — Hamlet ! ancient Abel's blood Cried from the ground not more than mine to-night, And he had vengeance. Wherefore rest not thou, But in the face of fierce Intolerance And laggard Law, find out and sieze all those Whose hands are filthy with the sacrilege ; Yea, though the sinners may be found with men Who sit in stately places, hold not back But drag them into open day, and make Their name a sound of shame throughout the land.
