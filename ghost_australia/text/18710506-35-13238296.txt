We had still further proof of this confusion of ideas in tho charge delivered to tho jur) by Judge Simpson, for it was clear from that gentle- man's remarks, that he must have supposed that infidelity and blasphemy were pretty much tho same thing No one, however, who reflected on the subject, would conclude that they were alike, for a man might be a thorough infidel and yet give no exprcfsion of his views which would be offensive to tho opinions of others. Yet Judge Simpson seemed to think that putting a stop to infidelity was the same as putting a stop to blasphemy If ho understood tho Premier anght, that hon and learned member held that tho common law regarded order as the main point to be aimed at in tho penalties inflicted m what was called blasphemy But it wns ondent that if a Judgo nero entitled to stop infidelitv bv a sentence, ho Mont a littlo bo- yond tho idea of preserving order and in regu- lo this very case it had not yet been shown that Mr Jones published anything calculated to proioko a 1 reach of the peace, much less that his intention was to do that It lias therefore ondent that Judgo Simpson went beyond the principle of the definition of tho common hw as stated b) tho Attorney-General Ho Mont further, for ho thought the opinion of tho Attorney -General, as dclneredm this House, was inconsistent with tho prin- ciple which had been adopted in tho mother country. In e,iucml thoCcuits of lan had punished cases Mhero there mis such a collision of persons interested as might produce among them something like a breach of the peace But when wo cunio to consider the question of jrosccution for the publication of books supposed to con- tain bluBphemous ideas, wo got into a sphere that was re- moled from tho définition of tho lan laid down by tho Adorne)-General. If tho common law regarded tho prose- cution for blasphemy maiuly as an end to tho preservation (f order, in what May did tho common lan authon-o the nrosecutun of persons for tho mero publication of books-' "lhero could bo no danger of a breach of tho peace ullin a book nas published and yet pro fccution Irr lho pubnuitiun of bjo! 3 «uppos»d to contain blasphemous opinions had taken place lho law was full of lnconsi-te-tcies but ho admitted that tho viens of tho Attorney- General nero homo out by tho charter of Rbodo Island, although in many other în.tnnccs authorities might bo quoted to tho contrari 1 hat charter ran thus -" No person vv ithin the said colony sholl be molested, punched, disquieted, or called in question for any differences of opinion in matters of religion M bo docB not actually disturb the public peaco " Numeiuus instances of confusion and ambiguity upon the judicial definitions of blasphemy might bo cited, and it would not bo difficult to show that thev wore inconsistent with euch other. According to tho ponai codo of Now York, " Blasphemy consists in wantonly uttering or publishing nords casting contumelious rerroach or profano ridiculo upon God, JCSUB Chtist, tho Holy Ghost, the Holy Scnpturcs, or tho Christum religion " Then there was lho slatuto 9 and 10 William III rhnplir 32, which was p-irilv repealed ns to Unitarians by D3 Qcorgo III , while it was left to operate its regarded others Lord Tenterden, in the case of Robort 1 ni lor, m his charge to tho jury, said " lho Act of King V illinm, pi«sed for particular purposes, imposes new mid special penalties upon n hat w as a prei íous oitlnco at common Inn, nnd that the repealing of this Act and tho subséquent Act of Giorgo III. left tho common law exactly nhero it nus found at the date of the enactment of the former Act " I oíd Kenvon on nnotbor occasion, observed that, " To lm puen the Christian religion is a nusde- icinour at commun law" And Mr. Jusüco Ba)Io) said, "To l^lpe^ch tho cstiiblielud faith, or to cndenionr to unsettle tho belief of olliers, is a mi_dtui(anout at common law, und suljccts tho oilenderat thodiscre tion of the Court, tohne,imprisonment, nud jefnmous corr oral punishment " lins was an interpreta tie n of the hw by a J udgo on tho Bench, and ho thought that on that nlone ho lins entitled to ask tho House to chango tho lan.

Ho had no dc.iro to press tho ciso of his clients with rvteronco to tho trail«, of omni buses bo) ond the bounds of the city proper, having entirely to the suburban munitipilitics tlio regu- lation of omnibuses, eo fur as thoy hid an) thing to dj with tbo roads passing through thoso municipalities Ho thought bo should bo borno out v bon he silted thit at tho ongm of tho manngtiiunt of omnibus trilli", the Corpora lion of ¡sydney had to deni with a matter of limited extent oompired to that with which thoy had to deal with of late )oais In the first few years of their management of that nutter, tin eil) proper was ver) large compared to tho suburban districts Uo thought that if tho report to wluth bo had jnst referred, and tho oudtneo up.u which thnt rup irt vvi. based was perused, theio would not bo fouud ia it anything that would impeach Ins clients in regard to the inin/igo nitnt of the omnibus trafilo and the funds of tho ' it> Ho should b) and-b)0 show wh) tho bill should not be entertained when it touched the inanagonieut of tho cabs end velucli s in regnrd to v\ Inch there waa not ono single iota of complaint «gainst tliem Tho roport was base I upon the evadenco taken botero a lonnnitteo, nnd ono of tho first thingB to which the attention of tho Houso was brought, wis the political lnlluenio which tho Ma) or and aldermon of the city of S)dney wero able to t_ert in consequence of their partialit) in granting licenses to those people appl) íng to thom for licenses Ai hat was meant to bo svitl was tins, that there waa tho annual election of Uiisoi and alder- men, and thoso persons-proprietors and drivers- who had an interest m the convoyantes had vote«, and that thoroforo it was to the interest of the Mn)or and nldonnon to cultivate the interest nnd goodwill of thoso persons in ordor to secure their votes Now ho would at once Bhow thit so far as that complaint was concerned thero was no roason whatever for it. There wero l63 licenses for proprietors of «mnibuacs, which wero owned by 107 proprietors, thoso omnibuses pi)ing within tho city of Syduoyand suburbs Now 06 ot thoso 107 proprietors wero residente in tho suburban municipalities, and li only resident m tho city of Sydney. Therefore thero wcro only 11 of tho proprietors who had votes, and upon whom thia .remendona intluenco was to bo exercised by tho mayor and aldermen of Sydney Of course, so far ns thoso resi- dents in the suburban mumoipalities wero con- cerned, neither mayor nor aldermon could oxerciso any influence because their votes wero not embraced m tho districts or wards for which tho mayor and alderaion were elected Thero wero 212 liconsod drivers, of whom 38 only reside- in Sydney, and again thoy found tho tremendous political influence tho mayor and aldermon wero supposed to exercise to cullavato tho good-will of these persons m overlooking thoir faults as omnibus drivers, and by refusing to deprive thom of their licenses io a ease where licenses ought bo taken away. Th_t was one of the complaints. A great doal hod been satd in the evidence about tho 'bus bo)s, and that thoy woro immoral, that they did not sutlicien tly cul th ate reading, that thoy wore not propoily dressed, and that instead of occupying their tuso between the starting of the 'buses by roadmg, the) engaged in marbles, pitch and toss, and in other ways It might bo highly improper that thoso boys should bo doing that, but how could that be a charge against his cheats, and why should they bo responsible for tho morality of the hoys or in any wa) for their education ." Ho did not know whether it waa intended te mond the matter by submitting the boyB to a highl) compétitive examination before being onplo)ed ns 'bus conductors, or that they vero to pass through a compotitivo examination not only as to mental requirements but ns to outside garment« But supposing his .lunts were wanting in their duty, ho would like to know how any commission which could bo consti- tuted wero to nuprovo it. Unless thoy passed in Act, lfko the Factory Act in England, ho did not seo how they could interfere wuh ih__o gamos of nu-b's", end en- force upon the bo)s tho Btudy of Grcvk er Lntin, or any niodoro languages (Laughter ) Taking another complaint, it was said that tho omnibuses wero infested with vermin, and it was said that many of tho unfortunate boys wero under the necossil) of slcopin0r in thom, by which tho ver- min got mt* the omnibuses But ho» were the) to prevent that kind of thing r Wero th.y to establish n «opnrit. clasa of ouinibiifca as in Araci ica r1 What particular teat was to be established for tho purpose of testing that a person who offered himself waa not infested with vermin or not i Tho quesüen was ono whith was entiroly in the hands of the public. Ho did not know that they wero called upon to establish any rulo by winch persons who did not choose to wash thonisolvoa every morning «hould not be permitted to outer tho omni- buses _ he public need not get into the ommbusos thom selvcs, and in that wa) thoy had tho rouiody m their own hands It was said that many of thoso 'buses on occa- sions of nice meotingB or other entertainmout, wore token off the Tuad to the inconvenionco of the public But let them soo what tho real Btatctf things was On public holidays persons applied for tickets to tnablo them to run along a certain route, and only a certain number of tickets woro issued in order to prevent tho public on particular roads from being deprived of the convenience of these omnibuaos That waa ona of the regulations, and if thoy found that tho regulations vero affirmed and properly administered thero could not bo anything to complain of In tho ovidonco Îiven by Mr Halo, it w as stated that the rogulationa wore airly administered, so that, when thoy had the regula- tions, they found that tho public wero not inconvenienced, ano that, so far from that, their convenience was studiod, »na only a certain number of omnibuses wero allowod to be removed, and that number calculated according to public convenience It was also stated that there was a great deal of loitering on tho stroots, and racing after they left tho point of departure. That, ho submitted, ought always to ho in tho hands of tho police, for they could not havo a footman runuing after tho omuibuse.. starting fram a particular point to seo that they went at tho rogulir pac-o. And where llioy had a largo _ body of pilicvi for their convenience Su far us tho starting of the «trmi buses was concerned, the greater part of that was really a mutter in the hands of tho suburban municipalities for they lind entire power to arrange it ns they chuso, llioro was no reason why regulations should not bo arrived at for tho starling of tho omuilmsos. It wn_ said that a gool deni of deception took place by a person-s .y A., going lo the Council Chamber with a good dress nnd II good Imrae.s on tho horses, nml by thal means ohlaining a license; and that ho Biib.equ-ntly passed tho elrcs. and hnrncsfl to B., mid so on to othcr.s. . Wull, supposo that was tho c is«, how could three Comnii__ionar_ bo sufficiently )yn.x-oyed to vr,'vcul; St- ill° only way ia which it could bo dono wns to put a stump upon tho dress and humes- (ocnablu thom to ho id -nt'ili-d Tli'iro M'as, thero toro, no compliant against tho C.i-p.ralioa, in that matter, inasmuch us they could not li.tvo e.nlrol over it. Now supposing ho had no1 given answers to tho cotnpl "nts ho found that tho report ilsolf said that, notwithstanding all tho complaints, nud all tlio grounds of complaint, thoro had been a Material ¡inproveiuont. Wull, upon tha¿ ground, if ho had no other, ho would ask tlio Hum» to hold its ¿and before depriving his clients. Tho proof tint progress had been rnudo was a proof that thoy would entirely got rid of tho complaints. Originally tho traolo was limited, und tlio moans of hin clionts wero limited; but as tho necessity for au merimo in their energy uroso, thoir energy did increiao, and im- provement was malo. It had beon admitted that a greatdoal of improvement had been mudo ; and, with regard to tho traffic in tho strebls, arrangements had been mide by Cnptaln M'Lerio, Superintendent of Polico, that the polico should BOO that not only within the city; proper, but within a radius of eight milos, tho omnibus-drivers should 'comply with tho jegutntions.' 'Therefore, a. the ovil had grown, and as tho nccc3eily for improvement hud arisen, so had, tho energy and determination of his client» to repress that evil increased. Whoa they fonnd it nocesjn.y to call in tho assistance of the police, thoy availed themselves of it profitably, and that was admitted on tho fuco of the report. The Houso should bo cautious how they proceeded to legislate, in a manner that would deprivo his clients of tbo regulation of tho trafilo within iho eily of Sydney, uuloss it hhd been Bhown thero hod boen grots carelessness on thoir part, and a determination to ignoro tho interests of tho public. Thero wore 28 lines of oriinibuses. Tho total number of miles travelled was 1C2. Within tho city tho tot ii longth of road was 50 milos; tho longth of trust roids was 43 miloB, and the length of roads in snbarban municipalitif s was 8 miles 500 yards. How then could tho suburban municipalities bo heard to complain ng linst his dionts, becauso thoy had tho bulk of the management and tho bulk of tho fee ? The suburban municipalities had no right to say one word with regard to tolls. On theso trust roads there were toll bar., and each omnibus paid £21 6B. annually to tho tolls, sometimos as high as £27. Ho did not think tho suburban munici- palities had any right to complain against his clients. Tho foo paid to tho city by each omnibus was £7 10s. which was expended upon a traffic of over fifty miles travelled hy tho omnibuses. On not ono of the trust roads WOB tho annual foo less than £18 ; BO that compared with tho foes paid outsido of the city, the city did not rccoivo anything liko à fair proportion of compensation for wear and tear of streets. Tho 5th section of tho bill provided thnt the commissioners should bo a body corporate, consisting of the Mayor of Sydney, tho Inspector General of Police, and a third gentleman, who waste boolectcd in a manner afterwards provided. Thosixth Boction provided that the Mayor should bo chairman, that in his absence ono of the elected commission should bo chair- man, that two should form a quorum, and that tho chair- man should have a casting TOÍO when the votes wore equal.' Supposing a person presented himself and required a licento, and tho Mayor and the elected commissioner were the only commissioners proscnt ; tho two commissioners dilfored, and tho Mayor might then givo his casting vote and doiide tho matter ; so that political influence might bo exeroisod very strongly under this system. As to the working of the bill, tho assistance of practical persons, as mentioned in tho report, would not bo required. If tho bill wero passed, however, it would bo very expensive in its operation. Tho House, by passing it, would do nothing moro than create II Board for tho purpo. o of eating money. The 12th section provided for tho establishment of a metropolitan transit office, with a largo staff of officers. Tho receipts from feos for 1870 were £2509 18s. 6d. [Mr. TUNKd : You will bo kind enough to slate what nrises from fines.] Ho would deal with that presently. Prom boat licensos no more than £100 could by any possibility be obtained ; and adding all fees likely io bo received together, thoy would amount to about £3050 per year. If this bill wero curried out wo should havo two commissioners, who would havo ' to attend one ordinary meeting overy week, be; ¡des urgency meet- ings at intervals. That, at £i for each commissioner's at- tendance each weok, would amount to £¿08 por ,year. It had been stated by Mr. Kingsbury that tho insp.etors' salaries could not bo lo_s than £150 each, and tho pay of tho ten inspectors would therefore amount to £1500 por year. The rent of premises for tho " Motiop .titan Transit Ofllco " would bo about £200 per year ; tho registrar's salary would bo £100 par year; tho in- spectors, say two at £250, would recoivo £500 por yoar nnd there would be two lads at £60, which would be £120 per year. This would mako tho total yearly' expanses £2978, and thoro was no doubt thot other incidental ex- penses would bring them tip to £3000 per year. With regard to fines, it wan contended that under this system thero would bo none. There would bo no bad .'bits.., no ill-conducted drivers or conductors, &c.f; and, therefore no fines at all. But, oven supposing thero wore tho balance would be very trilling. The 20th Bcction of tho bill provided that tho money received under tho Act should bo appropriated to tho payment of expenses in connection with tho Act, and that tho bilanoo should bo divided annually among the suburban munici- palities in equitable proportions according to the lenjrth of road maintcd by each municipality, and tho weir and tear. If there M'ero any balance to divide, tho commission would havo to procure tho services of somo calculating machine to lind out how it Bhould be apportioned. It would ba no use to securo Colenso. Thoy must havo a man with sorao knowledge of Equity, with somo engineering skill, and a good mathematician. It was not only tho length of road that was to bo calculated, but the amount of wear and tear which it sustained: and how this equitablo propor- tion was to bo arrived at ho did not know. This bill included cabs and drayB, with respect to which no complaint had been made ; but ho behoved that thoy wero included simply at tho suggestion of somo person who desired that the law on tho subject should bo cons.li dated. Law reform might bo a very good thing, but woro tho House, to get rid of ono leaf of tho statute book, going . to sacrifico tho interest of his clients ? The Council had enjoyed theso fees for many year., but tho effect of this bill would be to doprivo them of their rights, and to divort the revenue which had been derived from this source to the cultivation and maintenance of a Commission rather than to tho maintenance of tho streots for tho repair of which it had been dovoted. Tho measure was one which went in the faco of the spirit of all modern legislation. Decentralisation, was the principle of modern legislation, but the effect of this bill was to tako oat of tho hands of local authorities the management of local affairs. H. iincerclv trusted that the House would carefully consider this kill in the light of the few remarks ho had boen enabled to mako; and ho was content to leave with the greatest confidence the interests of his clionts ia tho hinds of this honorable House. The learned gentleman withdrew. Mr. TUNKS said that with the permission of tho HOUBO he desired to coll attention to certain correspondence which ho had receivod on this subject. When the question was lost before tl}o Houso, tho Colonial Secretary suggested that it should bo ventilated amongst the suburban munici- palities. Ho had accordingly addressod tho following lettor to the various councils :- , > " Stl Leonards, 21st February, 1871. " To the Mayor ot the Borough oi "Sir,-Borne timo since, ntray request, tho Clerk of the Legisla- tivo Assembly forwarded to your Council a copy of tho bill intro- duced by mc te regulate public vchicios and boats within' tho police district of Sydney. The second reading was an Order of ihc Day for Friday last, and lho ? debato was adjourned for a fortnight, to afford, it was stated, an opportunity for tho ex- pression of opinion on the subject by the suburban Borough Councils (wo Saturday's Herald). 1 would therefore be glad If you would communicate to mc the opinion, of your Council, or if that ho impracticable within the time, your own opinion of the proposed measure. " 1 have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant, 1 " WILLUM TUNKS." That circular was addressed to tho Municipal Councils of Balmain, Alexandria, Cook and Camperdown, Marrick- ville, Newtown, North Willoughby, Paddington, Redfern, Waverley, Woollahra, Waterloo, East tit. Leonards, Glebe, and Randwick. In overy case liut one-where he had not received an answer-tho replios stated that tho Council to which the circular was addressol concurred in the measure now before the Houso. He held the replies in his hand, ond tboy could be read by any hon. member. Mr. R. FORSTER moved tho adjournment of tho de- bate for a week. Mr. S. BROWN said that tho bill had boen before tho Houso sines the 7th of Dooembor. It was a matter of great importance to the suburban municipalities, and ho hoped that tho Houso would deal with it now. Mr. WILSON supported tho adjournment. Time ought to ho allowed for the consideration of tho argu- ments of tho learned counsel. Mr. TUNKS |said that if thero was any weight in these arguments thoy would never havo greater foroo than now. Mr.pRlVER supported tho adjournment. The motion was agreed to on division. Ayes, 15 ; noes, 9. Mr. DRIVER desired to lay certain documents on the table ef tho Houso to which the learned counsel had referred, and to movo that they bo printod. ' Mr. TUNKS said that tho hon. momber could not do that. Ho was not a Minister, but a paid officer of tho Cor- poration. IMMIGRATION. Mr. LLOYD moved that the Houso resolvo itself into a Committee of the Whole to consider the proprioty of bring- ing in a bill to provide tor immigration into the colony of New South Wales. Mr. GARRETT did not soo why the time of the Houso should bo taken up in initiating businoss which could not possibly be completed this session, Alter some «marks from Mr, DRIVER and Mr. It. FORSTER, in regard to tho impossibility of dealing with a matter of such great importunco nt so Into a period of t'io MS«ion and Iho propriety of such a bill being introduced as a Government nu asuro Mr. STEWART and Mr. TUNKS opposed the motion. The Intttr gintlc-tniin exposed his opinion that tho pro- posed bill wn« no moro likely to como into opnratiou this session than he (Mr Tunk-) wns likoly to liy. (Laughter) Mr, CUMMINGS opposed tho motion. Mr. AVIL-ON said Ihat at this lulo period of tho session it would lo nu abmluto imposnibility to pass into law a mensuro liku that contemplated by the bon. ruoinbcr for NiwciiBtle«. If this iiuiti"u woro carried it would only encumber tho business pa|ier. It appeared to him tobo the nlmost unanimous opinion of tho Himno that this matter «boula to allowed to «lund nvei tor ii tuno, mid ho thought the bon. member would do well to withdraw it. Ho bolioved it would bo iinpussiblo for any private member at any timo to pirns nn imiiiigr,ition bill through the House. Mr. LLOYD : Thon it uuvor will bo passed. Mr. DILLON «aid ho thought if tho lion, member had any /eui for tho matter ho would txorci«o a wiso dUerotion in withdrawing his motion. Mr. LLOYD ro«o to nddro'B tho House, Mr. DRIVER: lins tho bon. nioinbur u right of reply. Mr. LLOYD wished to withdraw tho motion, and in doing so lo say a tew words. Mr. GARRETT : Tlio hon. member could not withdraw nn older of tho day. Tbo motion was put nnd neg.itived, Mr LLOYD moved thnt tho order bo discharged. Ho rrgrottid that bon. membert hud not taken a difl'oront view in relation to this militer, which ho regarded as one of tho mest importent which could como buforo tho House. It wns bia intention to havo naked tho Houso to hnvo allowod a bill to bo brought in by a privnto meinbor, nnd furthor to allow tho question to bo considered nn open one. Ho was convinced that what this colony required to make it prospe- rous wn« a mtaauro of immigration of a judicious character. Ho believed tbut ho could introduce a bill which would carry a largo portion of tho Houso with him. Ho did not particularly wiah, howevor, to bring in such a bill hirasolf if «orno one oleo would tako tho matter up. Ho would sup- port any other bon. meinbor in cairyiug out so dosirnbio an object. Mr. Cowper suggested that it should bo an open question, and if hon. members wanted the country to pro- gress they would not set their faces against such a mea- sure. , Tbo motion was put and carried, and tho order was dis- charged. MAITLAND DISTRICT COUNCIL. Mr. DODDS moved that tho Maitland District Council Bill be now read a second timo. Ho oxplained tho objoct of the bill, which was of a similar character to tho.bill of last cession, which reached its Bccond reuding when the Houg adjourned. Tho revenues under expenditure by tho Mait- land District Council wero at ono time considerable : bat latterly they had been BO far diminished that thoy had not been ahlo to givo effect to the provisions of tho charter. [Attention called to the state of the House, and a quorum termed.] Ho trusted that hon. members would remain for a very few minutes whilst ho explained tho objecta of the bill. Tho Council hud been unable to carry out tho objecte for which it had been instituted. Tho only person in the employ of the Council was a clerk, who was authorised to superintend tho roads within the districts mentioned. One source of revenue entrusted to the Council had been taken from it. Tho late Government refused to hand over any of the annual amounts that were voted, in conaoq'uenco of there being a want of proper supervision of the roads. Tho w bolo of tho Council's income was now derived from two for ries, ono at Largs and the other at Hinton. Tho receipt, only amounted to about £3001 £208 of that amount woro spent in repairs to punts, wharfs, rent of otlices, and salary of secretary. So that no public benefit was roally derived from the existence of this Council. Tho inhabitants with- in tho electoral district of East Maitland havo requested that efforts would be made to abolish tho Council. In lieu of tho Council,it was thought that commissioners might bo appointed to tako charge of the moneys collected in tho dis- trict, and also to take charge of tho road grants. Ho might alco state that when the Roads Bill was passed in 187U, a clause was introduced into that bill which had the same effect as this bill, so that the Houso was BO fur committed to the passing of thi» bill. - Mr. WILSON thought that the mcasuro beforo the Houso waa ono which required a good deal of consideration, and hon. members ought to weigh well what would b. the .fleet of allowing tho bill to bo passed. Thero was no doubt that this Maitland District Council had bcon working very badly; but that was not in consequence of anything inherently bad in the constitution of tbo Council, but from tho 'petty squabbles that had taken placo between the members. Ono reason of it was, that the number of members waa too Bunill ; but a remedy had buen provided in the Act. Tho Act piövided that tho number of members should be regulated according to tho population of the district. After the census had been taken, the Govern- ment might find it necessary to considerably inareaio tbo number of members, and that probably would romedy ninny of the ovils that wero complained of. Ho thought the Hou.o ought to toko that fact into consideration. AB everything in this country was lending to municipal action, tho Houso ought to consider well before it put an end to this Council. ' Thero was no doubt that the annual grant to this Connell was stopped by tho lato Government. The Council, however, had almost unanimously signed a petition asking the Government to reconêider the matter. Ho believed that tho causes which hud led to tho introduction of this bill uroso from tho potty squnbbles which hud taken placo between tho councillors themselves. Ho thought, considering the position, of atrnirs, that it would bo well if the han. member would withdraw tho bill. Mr. GARRETT Raid thero wera only two such bodies as tho Maitland District Council iu tho colony, and thoy wero anomalies compared wiih iho rest of our municipal tmiitu tions. Thero wero municipal councils within thu Maitland District which were willing lo take over the functions of this body, and ho thought this bill ought to be agreed te. Mr. DILLON hoped hon. members would not agree to the second reading of this bill. It was all very well fur tho mover of thiB bill to speak of the stato of things which ren- dered tho measuro necessary. But the real cause which had led to tho introduction of this bill was to bo found in the petty squabbles which had unfortunately taken placo be- tween tho members of tho Council. But, because thero hnd been potty squabbles, that did not form a reason why the Council should bo dissolved. The lirst objection which he took to tho bill was that it was partial in its nature. There were two District Councils in oxistenco in the colony at the present time-the Maitland District Council, which it was sought by this bill to dissolve, and tho Pater- son District Council. This bill made no attempt te deal with the latter body. If it was necossary to dissolvo one, why waa it not necessary to dissolve tho other? Attention was called to the state of tho Houso, and there not being a quorum present, the Speaker, at twoaty one minutes past 9 o clock, adjourned the House until 3 o'clock on Tuesday next. The following members wore in the House when it waa counted out:-Messrs Lord, Wilson, Byrnes, Stewart, J. Suttor, Dillon, Lloyd, R. Forster, Cummings, Garrett, Dodds, Brookes, Farnell, Hill, Neale, Driver, S. Brown, Hoskins, Laokoy.
