The Cinematographe. ONE of the most wonderful marvels of the age is to be exhibited at the Oddfellows' Hall on Friday next for two days only. It is the latest invention of Edison, who has evidently solved the problem of how to make ghosts appear, for of all the most ex traordinary sights it is perhaps the greatest to see pictures of people, animals, railways and ships moving about as they do in reality. You see a rail way train approaching in the distance, the steam putling out of the funnel. It reaches the station, when it stops, and you see the carriage-doors flung open by porters and the guard, whilst numbers of travellers tumble out of the carriages, exactly as they did when the picture of them was taken. In a moment the picture vanishes, and is replaced by the stage of tile Alhambra in London, on which appears the famous ballet-dancer, Madame do la Rosa, who performs a paj soul. Anon the picture changes, and there is a magnificent steamship riding on the ocean, with the waves dashing over her bows. The picture of the " Grand Old Man" is also seen in one of his famous orations on the floor of the House of Commons. Amongst other cele brated places is also seen Sackvillo stroet, Dublin, the widest street in all Europe.
