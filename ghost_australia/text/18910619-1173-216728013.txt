As.they sat. for si few momentB listening, they could hear the marmur ol voices, bat oonld not eeetha speakers. Then all was silent for several minutes, and the two watchers began to feel apprehensive that they had lost those they were pursuing. It was a strange scene. Tha rosking boat, with the two eager men, floating under the frowning-cliSi of the ghost-haunted isle; the J" voices, which they knew were human, bat 1 whos's possessor? were as inviribie'sa though .ihey vo':e ttife lab'.ed cap of darkness; the swelling seewith its myriads of phnsphoresoent gleams, and the deathly silence broken now and again by, the boom ^ the sea in one of the'-blow holes, Bounding like the' anguished moan of & lost spirt, was terribly impressive. " Beooming impatient,- the officer and his companion pulled round the rocks, bat they had not proceeded a hundred yards, when Chapman, looking back, gave a cry of earprise which attracted hie comrade's attention. Glancing in the same- direction, the young man distinctly .saw a boat njsking away from the spot they had Waited at, under the., overhanging ledge of rock,.

Chapman strongly nrged the authorities to arrest Grecves, but as there was no direct "obarge against him, they refused to do so. The efisjrts of the Superintendent and his men against Penfold would most probably not have secured a conviction against him either, had it not been for an ascidental discovery, which cleared up more tbsu one mystery. The attempt to oonneot Penfold with the escaped convict of six years previouely broke down Citerly. In the first place, he insisted that bis name tvaa Trcgurtha, and the man who head him callen Pinfold was dead, and in appearance he did not resemble the "missing felon. As showing a weak pr.int in the convict management,"the-description^cf "No. 1289" had been given in 1811, nearly twenty- . four, years prevkr.isiy, and it certainly did { not correspond with the old gray-headed ' Tregurtha ; yet he was kept udder.arrest ^hile enquiries were made, regarding the contraband spirits and tobacco found in the cavern.' Chapman took a leading part in the investigation, but the more he enquired, the more puzzled he became. He caul'd not in " anyway connect Tregurtha 'with the, affiir. He found that his prisoner had owned'a comfortable larm at New Norfolk some thrpe years previously, when he had sold it for: a considerable amount, and it was by merest accident be stumbled on the truth. In the eastern end cf Hobart Town was an jaotel,of bad repute, called the "Live and. Sift Live Inn." It was the tistfrt of very questionable characters, but its-owner was pnderEtood to bsrapidly amassinga fortune, so that the businees must have been liicura- 'tive. " r''- * Chapman was passing this public-house one afternoon, when he saw -Offiaer -Greevea coming out of it. He was surprised at this, as the place was not resorted to by " officera and genUemen." With the ihBtiaet of the born detective he scented a dieoovery, and «rossii2g tUie.rpsd, he carelessly fitrolled into the hotel. The bar was filled #rith roaghlooking iellows, and as Chapman called 'for i his drink iie critical enrveyed first the occupants and then the appurtenances of the bar. There was a number of bottles around, but most of the drink was being served out of small casks, which stqodon a email bench. . These fixed the -detective'e eyes, and he began to -wonder where he had seen similar ones. His memory was soon refreshed. It was in the fatal cavern 1 of Bsadaaan'slsie; -His interest, -which was at first i suddenly aroused by this duooyery, scoa abated,.ss:.he reflected, that there were probably, thousands of -casks .similar.to, those.in. the "cave. ;Yet,. as he thought., it.. again occurred to him . that smuggling, would iiot be carried on unless there was a market tor the contraband article's,' and the' duly market thereabouts was Hobart To wn. The "truth flashed on .him. The midingiit visit- to Ihe baVe m for the purpose of obtaining a supply for sale ,4n the town. This decided him, and he went to, the chief of police and acquainted him with his suspicions. Specimens, .oi 'the corticles ionnd in the cave were in ihat iunoiionary"^ oiSoe, and lie decided to. send a< polite message to Duncan McLeod, owner of ^hBTiive and LetTrive Hotel, that he wiahed to see-him. •" ' !

' • , . • " Why, the bound,"-burst out McLeod, "I never smuggled.a drop; I only bought it<rom him/and gave him a good prioe.'tbo.

Th6 details of the trial would not iie very interest-, ing, eo that A short.sketch will be .more ac ceptable. .... . It appears -that -Greeves -was formerly :a seaman with- Penfold, under Captain Tremayne, -when thelatter -was sentenoed to life traiisportation lor the attempted mutiny. He gradually worked himself up in his pro' fesaion until in 1827 he was third effioer on board the Argus. This vessel -pras sent to Hobart Town, and, (Lading his old mate and •Wftraa.friend.Peufold w^e etill alive in the j Hobart Town prison, he decided to release I him if possiblt. .•„••. i | • . Tne smogglisg spirit -was fltropg in him, i and he bad on board a quantity, of contra- jj baud, liqucr. McLaod WAS a turnkey in tbe } gaoi^and-by judicious bribery be effected! Periftila's -escepe. Two days previously j iireeves, with t. psTty of pleasure-seeker*, s had beeh on a visit to Deadman's Island,! asid Greeves, noticing the cavern, -which aid ' Dot then have the pivot stone in front, decided it would be a good hiding-place for the convict. ' f UujSng a small boat, he brought Penfold ta ! it, and^a exploration the cavern was foncd & to ba " a good retreat. Here the smuggled s drink was brought, and Greeves kept, up a supply of it to his accomplice on Daadznan's Isle, who, in disguise,- dispaasd of it in Hobart Town, and the two were rapidly making a fortune. Penfold had studied optics, and by the means of glares he was able to produae thaghost on the clifiin order to frighten off intruders, bat it had the effect of leading to hie capture. The trial resulted in Greeves receiving five years' imprisonment, and Penfold biing sent back to his life Servitude. A year later theEe (go men finally escaped unde;r extraordinary oupamstances, which will be detailed in a future Ghronicle. . Tbe history o£ these two men proves that natural.brainpower and force of character will assert themselves,, no matter in what difficult circumstances they may be placed. Here waB Penfold—a chained and wellguarded felon—who found means on two successive occasions to escape tha vigilance of hia guards, and finally escape altogether; although it may well be understood that he was much more carefully watched after his re- capture than he was before. And then there was Greeves, a man of no education, who had worked himself up from ^ the lowest rung of the seafaring ladder, ana t had attained ' a position of responsibility j | and who finally contrived to escape with hi>i jj friend, in spite of almost insuperable difS- • cnlties. : "Chained to a Rock" will be the name ot; next week's Convict Chronicle,.
