Launch of a- Russian Ironclad. —The large ironclad cruiser Piurik was launched re cently from tho yards of the Baltic Works, on the Nova, in the pruseneo of the Emperor, the Empress, with her daughter, and the Grand Duke Constantino. Unfortunately, owing to the death of the Tsar's aunt, the Queen of Wurtoriiberg, tho Royal silver wed ding at Athens, and other circumstances, the other prominent members of tho Im perial family, including tho Grand Ad miral, tlio Grand Duke Alexis, were unable to be present. The Rurik is the big gest worship yet constructed in Russia, and is the longest irpnclad of all the'nnviesof Europe. Sho measures from stum to stern 435ft., with 67ft. beam, 25ft. 9in. in depth, and 10,933 tons displacement. Owing to lier great length and displacement it is Btnted sho will be ablo to make tho voyage from Cronstadt to Vladivostock, on tho Pnoific, about 19,000 miles, without once coaling on tho way. The speed is calculated at 18 knots, with triple- expansion engines, made at the Baltic works, of 13,250 1.H.P. The launch was attended by tho usual coremonies, and passed off most successfully. As tho great hulk slid down into tho water sho was saluted by the Binall artillery of tho Imperial yachts, and the shipping generally was gaily deoked with flags.

During a recent storm thore were no loss than thice instances in which the newly-established telephone wires proved of servico. At Bran- caster the lifeboat was called out by a tele phone message from the coastguard at Thorn- ham and saved five livps. At Hunstanton the lifeboat orow were promptly assembled in ro sponso to a telephonic message, but the neces sary assistance was given by another boat j while at Wintorton the telephone was success- j fully used to secure the services of a tug from Yarmouth to tow out tho lifoboat to assist a wreck on tho HappiBburgh Sands.
