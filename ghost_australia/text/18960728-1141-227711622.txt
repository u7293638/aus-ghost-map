The Waterloo Cup. This week the second Waterloo Cup of foe Benalla club will be inaugurated, and old and new competitors will meet and try conclusions on foe Benalla plumpton. The contest will be made noteworthy by the fact that such sterling dogs as Rosy Gem, Deacon, Darebin Chief, Waterhen, Cauldron, Mona, Wasp, Happy Jack aud Bloomer will be engaged. When the Y.C.C. became defunct in '94, to meet foe views of foe coursing public, foe Benalla club, which has done so much legitimate good for the eport, wisely decided to take over the running of this important event. The history of foe Australian "Blue Riband of the Leash " dates back twentv- one years, when it was first appropriated by Mies Hellier. On that occasion the stake was for 82 all-ages, at £12 1th. Since then, however, it has been materi ally reduced, and foe Waterloo Gap of to-day stands at 45 all-ages, at £3 8s. It may be fairly conjectured that Busi ness, Hazel, Border Boy, Rosy, Gem, Darebin Chief, Cauldron, Mona, Be witched, Wasp, Honeydew, aud Happy Jack will pass through foe first ordeal with safety, and, to sum up briefly, I ibink Mr. Tom Chadwiok's final deoision for the 1896 Waterloo Oup will be for HAPPY JACK, with Darebin Chief or Cauldron runner- up.
