THE ' GElJERAL'S : Was I ent ceally frightened ? though notin I3«e field. - 1 have seen fighting, as. yoa know, but 1 think tbej^Sg allude to was the closest shave I ever .

I should never get out of that ljou-e alive. M last I heard the rustling of a woman's | near me, and tbe noise in the street of a ]-s-. ing carriage, which appeurva to stop ctar. a female voice said : — j ' We are all ready.

Brown did all tbe talta; and now ceased urging the matter mitt1, th carriage stopped at the minister's resident* where we all alighted.
