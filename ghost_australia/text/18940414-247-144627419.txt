A PASTORAL REVIEW. The Grandview Grove Bible . Christian Chnrch. The Rev P. E. Mallalieu and His Work. Good cogregations assembled at the above church on Sunday last, the Rev. W. T. Abbott, who is about to leave for his new circuit in the Terricks district, preach- ing his valedictory sermon in the morning, and the Rev. P. E. Mallalieu, the minister in charge, who is entering upon his third year at East Prahran, in the evening, when the reverend gentleman reviewed the work of the year, taking as his text the words " And when they were come together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.' (Acts xiv. 27). The preacher said he deemed it wise and prudent to review the work that God the Holy Ghost had been carrying on in their xpidsU At tlte anniversary a financial statement was presented, and there, too often the matter ended. Why could they not give a balance-sheet which should contain a few facts concerning tbe real work of the church. Another year had rolled around. It had been one of hard fighting, strenuous efforts and patient plodding ; a year in our colonial history of unprecedented trouble, hardship, and poverty. Tbe depression had been tre- mendous; the cloud had been resting|On our commercial firmament ; the waters of our seas had scarcely known what calm was; ''men's hearts had failed them jfor fear. This subtle influence had by some mysterious means found its way into the church, for as tbe physical health] of' the individual ipf[nenced his Christian life B£-iritji*l well /being, so thet)uter life of the community influenced and affected the spiritual life of the church., Tjiat had been no ^ except|on^ to the general rule/' Tbe one gVeat (hiaracteristio of ihe year, commercially, morally, individually and ppiriiyilly, had been strain.

A principal part of their wors&p; had always been the preaehjng of the truth of God. His aim hadhten to represent Christ to the church and the world.
