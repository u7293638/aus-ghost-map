ROUND ABOUT NEW ZEALAND. BY "THE VAGABOND.' CAMPING OUT ON THE LAKES. Speybnrn, at the head of the west arm of Lake Monger, where we are camped, is not now a very swift running creek A number of! little streams trickle across the beach into the lake, all joined in one in the spring time, when the snow melts, and Spoyburu, then a mighty torrent, comes dashing into Munipcn bringing with it great trees, which are piled up here at its month in one great tangled mass an evidence of the resistless force of the waters It is rather hard now to find the real mouth of the creek The foreshore of the delta IS remarkably boggy, and I am sinking over my ankles in the mud, when a family party of teal comes sailing round the point One on the water and one on the wing are slaughtered by the right and left barrels Mick bring them ashore, and carries them back to the camp " Pot banting' this, no doubt I admit it I shall kill but what ducks we want for a change of diet, and a few brace to take to the station, with some other rarer birds for the sake of their skins Why should I slaughter what I do not require for use, and call it "Boort' The pot hunter has an excoBo.tue sportsman none, except that of indulging the passion to kill inherent in all savage races, and which has not yet been worked out of the Anglo-Saxon community The " chase ' is very exciting, no doubt, to the huntsmen, but how about the thing chased ? Where should one draw the line' The pursuit of the noblest , animal man must be most exciting of all. It is love of the game as well as the pay which makes detectives, mouchai ds, and informers human bloodhound, who do not cease their work till their victims are on the scaffold I return to the camp and look around Never Have I seen such beauty 1 The arm is apparently landlocked, rocky mountain bar tiers in every direction, no landing place except the little flat at the entrance of the creek, beyond this there is faintly de used in the shadows the gully through which it runs The beech where we have pitched our tent is but 20 yards wide The mountains are above and around us There is a splashing and dashing and roaring of a dozen waterfalls from the heights above They stand out sharp and clear these monarchs of the sky Leaning Peak opposite, that strange crag which is a landmark to the shepherds far away on the Manipouri Plains the Cathedral Peaks, faintly suggestive With their fretted outlines, of the poem in stone " at Milan, and Spire Peak far beyond Four to six thousand feet in the altitude of those, but there are scores of unnamed hills One dividing the two bays in the west and I christen Argus Point When the moon shines out and gilds the summits of snow, and the shadows fall in the dark waters, mirroring everything above it is Doresquoin its weird mixture of light and shade, Our fire Shines briskly, casting deep shadows in the birch trees above A Maori then attempts to run off with our chaps, but is chased away by Mick. Afar off IS heard the cough like note of the grebe Then the kiwi commences There are two varieties of this bird, the large and small, and they have different notes Awaiti there is the cry of the Kakapo, and other strange noises of which Henry cann o t tell me the origin Mick excitedly plunge, into the darkness, and shortly returns with a kakapo, a, beautiful plumaged bird, largest of the parrot tribe It is nocturnal, a fruit ester, and does not fly. It is not bad eating, but is remarkable in that it crushes and shows its food Naturalists tell us that birds, in default of teeth with which to mass vacate their food, are provided with a " strong muscular stomach, ' commonly called a gi? sand Into this they take Band or stones to assist in the process of digestion ostriches and emus prefer a few ounces of tenpenny nails when procurable The man in his day swallowed great lumps of rough quartz which would be worn round in time These are often found on the plains around Mam port and To Anan The Kakapo is different from any bird I over heard of-it has no use for a gizzard On the under part of its upper bill there is a horny serrated substance against which the food is thoroughly crushed and chewed before being swallowed Henry tells me of this, and opens the crew of the one Mick has just captured, and surely there is nothing there but digested food Another curiosity of animated nature I am (phi I shall find here, and that is that the beautiful created grebe digests its food by the aid of feathers, with which its gizzard is always filled without the slightest trace of sand or stones I long to see the wmgleSs, hairy bird the Kiwi, which lives in holes, IS nocturnal, and IB seldom seen alive All night long the price of this bird are heard around the camp All night long Mick is in pursuit, but is baffled in the tangled bush These other entrance cries, too? Are they from the mys te nous take, but very few specimens of which have been obtained, or does the ghost of the more wail over its old home An Irish gentleman, who I dare say believes in the banshee, of a family renowned for its hardihood and valour, was here with the party beforementioned. He tells me that the unearthly nocturnal cries at Speybnrn were enough to make one B flesh creep To me they only recall memories of tropical forests, and I posa into dreamland with the noise of the falling waters ringing in my ears and am young once more The years have dropped away, and I at and on the Terrapin tower overlooking Niagara s flood I am awakened in the morning by Henry s calling my attention to two long fat eels which he has caught with night lines They are broad in proportion, and many pounds in weight With the exception of a sinai' minnow and a mussel, the week is the only thing which lives in these waters, unless down in its depths some water monsters, long extinct elsewhere, may yet exist The lake eels grow as large as any longer , they are to be seen cruising about the weeds at the bottom of the water, and are easily " gaffed ' If one wants Sport, he can have it with the playful and slippery eel of Mampori When you have speared him, and got him into the boat, the fun commences It is a battle royal for a time , it seems as if the cat had got you He squirms till about, gives ' on a slap in the face with his tail which half stars and nearly knocks you overboard, twists round your leg with a grip like that of an anaconda and when at last you manage to insert your knife in the spinal cord, and find the vital spot, the blood sports over you, and, sanguineous and slimy, you feel as if you had Blain a mighty enemy. Properly skinned and boned, slightly salted, and dried in the sun, or smoked 01 of a wood fire, to take eel is a great delicacy, and worth all the trouble afore said Some people will not eat them, calling them water snakes, which is absurd New Zealand is like Ireland and Iceland, it possesses no snakes Tropical New Caledonia likewise is free from those reptiles, as is also Till, according to books of travel But I saw a fine collection of carpet snakes caught on the mountains of Ovalau The natives are very frightened of them, but they are perfectly harmless, and in olden time, were considered delicacies, a dish of 100 snakes being indispensable at the installation tar base of any great chief. But those were the days when Stowed baby was a standing dish, and roast missionary a luxury fondly Sighed for, as in spite of the bloodthirsty character given to the men of Vita, only one missionary was over killed, and that was by ignorant Namosi savages, who stowed him, elastic side boots and all, and wondered much at the toughness of the white man s feet. There are no snakes and no mosquitoes here, but here is a Band by , and now I rejoice in the possession of the veil bought on Dr Kohorte s recommendation The equally of New Zealand is a small black unobtrusive meet He doesn't make a noise or fuss about his work like a mosquito, he does it make day and night hideous with the herald mug of his approach, but he proceeds quietly and modestly to business, making him self felt in due time He is especially fond of the delicate small veins around the wrUta card makes long cloth gloves or mittens desirable, besides a veil for the pro- lection of the face or neck The sandfly, however, is generally so intent upon his work that he permits himself to he killed without any effort, fat other than the wily mosquito who will often defy all your efforts to have his blood in exchange for what he has taken of yours The sandfly too had another very good point With the setting of the sun he connon his labours , net tonnage, he is a very early riser, and he has sufficient sense to sleep in your tent ready for the morning s work The bite of this insect, however although annoying, is a trifle compared with that of the mosquito Life of every kind around the lake is limited at the head of the west and north arms animals there are none, the rabbits not having scaled the mountain ranges , as they haven't got here it is a sign the barrier is impassable Rut of birds there is a fair assortment, the thousands of round holes on the beach show where the kiwi has been pecking for his meal of grubs during the night, there is the trace of the kakapo, and another large print of some unknown bird The lake, the ordinary parrot, is occasionally seen, and high up in the mountains is the kind, that strange species of the parrot which from being vegetarian has become daintily carnivorous, and kills hundreds of sheep through digging holes in their vitals, in search of the beloved kidney fat I shall hear more of this bird around Wanaka, where he is most numerous, and at his worst At night a small owl, like the Australian "morepork, is heard, and from some of the lagoon there is the cry of a species of bittern By day there is the perpetual twitter and song of the turn and the smoke, answering each other. The former is a small black bird called, from its white throat, the personality , the latter is of a more delicate green. There is a large wood pigeon, something like the wonga, of bronzed green colour These, with the robin, are all the forest birds I Wherever we go a robin is with ne, taking us, as it were, under especial charge , it perches on our tent, eats bread crumbs, mutton fat, and developes a partiality for eels In time it will learn to take crumbs from one's hand I have held out my gun, and cr ried one perched on the barrel The true 1 confidence which the robin reposes in man is never abused But unlike its English namesake, there is never more than one round our camp or in our marches Should another appear it is immediately driven away by the first comer But on the waters there is a sufficiency of feathered life , there are three kinds of tea, the large and strong flying parad loo duck the grey duck, cormorants (for which a reward of 5s per head is paid by the Acclimatisation Society) and seugallB, which go to Sea no more There is a small globe, and the larger crested species You will see these come sailing down the lake at a great speed, their strong webbed feet Sinking out on each side like ours Attracted by the white boat they come nearer and nearer most beautiful of all waterfowl with their long necks, crested cora, bronze head, eyes Ilka fire, and beautiful white breast, which shines afar off on the surface of the lake They will not fly, but at the least alarm dive for hundreds of yards One must have a good gun to kill these-a pea rifle, perhaps, would be best It takes some time to get accustomed to shooting on the water, as the distances are very deceptive Bat I secure one fine specimen of the crested grebe " You far," Bays Henry, but it falls a victim. Some times we see a few black swans come sailing along majestically, turning their necks in serpentine curves They hear down on our boat, wondering what this strange thing may be But their curiosity does not lead them within easy range They By when they are CO yards off, and although the spirit of mischief or sport induces me to give them both barrels, a few feathers scattered on the surface of the lake is the only result I would not have minded killing it, but I am sorry to think that the poor bird will have a rheumatic pain in its wing tina winter which it will not be able to account for these swans have been imported from Australia, common there, they here justify the old Latin proverb On the banks of the streams flowing into the lake another curious bird will be met with, the mountain or blue duck. This does not fly, is reputed to perch on trees, and otherwise passes its life among the stones of the creeks, of which it is the exact colour, and except for its red head, it will easily be passed by So much for the fauna The flora of the lakes is principally composed of birch forest, with pines scattered amongst it. There is a dense under scrub, there is ironwood, major, grasstree, the entree, succulent and nutritious food for cattle, but which the rabbits have destroyed in other parts of the country there are nameless flowers, shrubs with sweet perfume, the useful manuka in abundance, flax, of course, everywhere, and an endless variety of ferns and mosses covering every fallen trunk and hang- ing down in great clusters from the trees There is only one deadly thing, the lulu, which occasionally is found growing on the shores Many days may be passed on the banks of Manton, camping in the different arms, exploring the creeks which run into them, with their many rapids and sinuous courses In low water the easiest travelling is along the bed of the streams, for the bush itself is nearly impenetrable Everywhere there are tangled masses of "windfalls, pile upon pile, rotten with age, covered with moss similar to what one finds in the forest of British Columbia I only miss the giant trees above One will find traces of the first explorers camp, and often on the banks of a creek a footprint will astonish you as much as one did Robinson Crusoe But in this soft yielding mosS tracks will remain for years You may investigate some of the waterfalls, deep ravines in the bills, falling in Slides of hundreds of feet into deep basins, thence tumbling and tossing hundreds of foot more into gorges below-every rock worn into a different shape, the waters foaming and laughing with life, bounding joy onely into the lake, whence after a term of probation, they will join the Wales, and on to the Bea We sail or row on Manipon, sometimes the surface like glass, every peak and crag, and much, and shade of colour of cloud, sky, and land reflected therein , some times the white water furious as those of the sea Life and colour light and shade, every where, evidences of the gigantic upheaval in times gone by evidences in the scarred faces of the mountains of great avalanches which have swept their course through bush and forest Not much level land to be found' though here and there, in the delta of a creek are little savannahs where the grass is high deep or sometimes well defined grassy roads, tracks swept through the bush by some torrent, charming avenues which lead no where but to impenetrable scrub At the end of Monument Arm there is the largest amount of cleared and the monument itself is a hill, merely 1500ft high , but it stands out as a landmark at a distance, and only when you are near it you recognise its insignificance To those who are fat and scant of breath, like myself, it is a sharp tug to the summit, but once there a splendid view of the islands which dot the surface of the lake is obtained Garnock Burn runs into this, and there is another small stream, up which you sail for 100 yards, and you are in a little lake or lagoon Neither this nor the Pirate s Den is marked on the maps I christen the former the "Moa'sPool ' It is just the sort of place where that giant bird would take his bath, supposing he were of cleanly habits, and afterwards he could have a run on the Bavannaha, naturally defined paddocks close at hand A few cattle have found their way up Garnock Burn to this retreat, and here they live in a state of nature, free from all chance of the brand or the butcher A few days of such a life as this make one a different man There is hearth and happiness sailing on the waters, there is health and happiness tramping on the beach, gun in hand, accompanied by the faithful Mick Once, however, he proves faithless I had walked round the Men's Pool, and shot at nothing, greatly to Mick's disgust, as he left me to superintend the erection of the tent, and when I came to retrace my steps Mick had gone. He would always lead one straight back, or by the path by which you came, I was nearly bushed amongst the great flax clumps and had a bad quarter of an hour before I struck the stream What a Robinson Crusoe look our camp always had the tent, the great fire the game hung around, eels smoking blankets owing on oars the boat on the beach and the dark hill and forest back ground-and I shall ever remember this with pleasure And I shall also remember with astonishment how I appreciated the cookery of Henry, who although he is totally ignorant of the uses of cayenne or lemon, yet provides mo toothsome- hunters fare But the sixth day out, on which young Bob was to bring the horses for me, Boon arrives, and by noon we sail our boat into Surprise Bay, and thence into the river. The sail through the bubbling waters at the entrance of the Waiau River is rather exciting The current carries UB along rapidly, but once beneath the high banks the stream is calm though swift Now we come on a congregation of black tea, but at this end of the lake they have made acquaintance with man and are wild, and the shots which I take at a very long range only render one hors de combat He will pipe no more to his mate bia diving and flying are over So we think, as for a second or two he lies on his back on the water, kicking helplessly in the air in that comical manner which has made " a dying duck a synonym for things ludicrous But to our astonishment he suddenly, with a somersault disappears We row over towards the bank and peer down into the water at the spot, where a hundred feathers show how the shot had taken effect on the poor teal A dozen feet below one sees a mass of tangled roots and Bags The bird has just gone and buried himself there to avoid the last indignity of being cooked and eaten ' We pull away, when we are still more astonished to see the real reappear 30 yards on the other side of the boat, sorely disabled, but still swimming away gamely It takes the contents of another barrel to finish him, and even then he has several good kicks left as he lies at the bottom of the boat It is now 1 o'clock, and the horses should be here to meet us The waggon is there on the bluff, where it was left six days ago, but there is no response save that of the echo to our " coo-ee ' But the reverberation here, as all around the lake, is most clear and distinct, and is repeated time after time, dying away far up the mountain gorge We boil our billy on the sands and have lunch Still no reply to our calls Then Henry suggests we had better unload the boat and carry the cargo up the cliff, saying that he knows of a nice easy place, where there is a regular stairs, much better than where we came down. It is cold and damp below, and I put on my thick orator and sling my bag round my neck I have a few minutes of a tough climbing as ever fell to my lot, backwards and for wards, Hy like, along the face of the bluff, holding on by trees and bushes, the stairs consisting of jutting stones or rocks wet and slimy by constant dripping from above There are several very awkward places in which, if one slipped, a broken neck might not be the consequence, but one would cor family be badly hurt But my foot is as firm as that of a mountaineer, upward I climb Still, when I reach the top I am glad to cast off my coat and throw myself passing upon it for a few moments' breathing spell Then I look down, and am astonished at the steep ness of the hundred and odd feet I have climbed However, my nerve is so good, I feel I could do it again, but I restrain the impulse When I landed in New Zealand I certainly could not have scaled this height without a considerable amount of that stiffening of the sinews and summoning up of the blood colloquially described as "pulling oneself together, which causes a considerable expenditure of nerve force Now, although I am scant of breath, I have come up the bluff side literally as if it had been a star What a glorious, renovating, health giving climate this is, even in the present cold season ' I feel young once more, my hand is steady, my nerves strong, I can shoot as straight and true with gun or pistol as most men I can digest mutton and post and rail infusion when in Melbourne I was living on beef tea and broad and milk And it is not three weeks since I landed at the Bluff ' As I stand here astonished at the change in myself, I long to proclaim to the people of the colonies and all the world, " come to New Zealand and be rejuvenated Come and sleep under a tent on a manuka bed, whilst the wind howls without Live in the open air, fare simply, as I do, and accumulate a sufficient stock of health to last you for another 50 years of civilisation with its spring beds, Chabba and fried oysters, lager beer and skittles ' I have come to the conclusion that it is what are known as the comforts of life which kill na off young I vow a vow of rigid abstinence from luxury-for the present Mounting a knoll, I look far over the Mampori Plain for the horses, whilst Henry brings our cargo up his " onay stairs " He is not by any means one of the Anakie, but his half dozen journeys, bearing various burdens, is a task for one of the strongest of men There is the tent, there our bundles of blankets two " tucker ' boxes, bogs, billies gun, sticks, and game rod and black teal, blue duck pigeon, kakapo, and grebe If any future tourists should employ Henry, I caution them not believe in his " easy paths ' By the time we have all our belongings on the Bluff, and the boat IS safely moored, there being no sign of the horses, it becomes evident that I must spend another night camped out This is a beautiful spot, however The Waiau flows beneath, hero broad and placid, there Swift and turbulent On the other side high banks and birch forest to the water's edge Wood and hill are mirrored on its surface The variations in the foliage give a charm never met with in Australia. The river itself is most lovely, it is as like an American stream as can be, and I am strongly reminded of one spot, very, very dear to me, on the Roanoke Beyond is the lake, the islands which I now know so well, the wooded heights of the Beehive, and the snow tipped Cathedral peaks, behind which the sun is setting On one side are the TakitimoB, stern, rugged, forbidding, before me the fern covered plain, bordered in the distance by the high land of To Anau Downs, and dotted with clumps of birch and manuka It is my last camp in the open around Lake Manapouri, and it will be long, very long before I have such a charming resting place again The scenery cannot be surpassed, still there are drawbacks at this camp The ferns and peaty ground are wet and damp, and there is no shelter on this upland I light the fire, whilst Henry pitches the tent He means to tramp to his hut to night, some four miles off, intending to catch his horse first thing in the morning and bring it to me to tide in, should the other animals not turn up After cup of tea he makes up his swag, and tramps off through the fern taking a star for his guide Previously however, we arrange that Mick shall be sent back to me first thing with a written message He has a trial to night Henry has been gone perhaps 20 minutes, and I am writing when at full speed the dog rushes into the tent with a piece of paper in his mouth I take it from him and reward him with a alice of mutton When he has bolted this I gave him another piece of paper, and send him to rejoin his master, and he disappears in the darkness with a waving tail and swelling rest his heart evidently full of pride at having performed his mission, and his epigaBtrum comforted by the mutton I expect Mick early in the morning The memory of that mutton will not fade There is darkness all around a few stars only are visible the wind is bowling, a deep loneliness pervades this solitude I don't expect any callers to night, as my nearest neighbour is the shepherd at Mount York, Seven miles away, so I will turn into my blankets and sleep till morning
