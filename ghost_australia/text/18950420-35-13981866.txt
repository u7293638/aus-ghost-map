FUGITIVE NOTES. There is some virtue in a retrogressive and reactionary second Chamber after all, because it we didn't have one it would be rather hard to say where a safe outlet for the surplus folly and accumulated wrongheadedness of the people s" members would find a vent In fact. it rather looks as if in the absence of a capitalistic and grasping Upper House a lofty and earnest Lower House would be constrained (to pass measures that it intended to carry out, which would be a very serious outlook indeed, and one that might result in a certain number of in- different members being relegated to their original sphere in the bricklaying, carpenter- ing, and other useful trades But as matters stand represent the two Chambers make a sort of leaning tower and are indispensable to each other, quite apart from serious considerations for in stance, the very strongestpillarsof the Upper House are the ardent patriots who propose conciliation and other humorous measures and conversely, what would become, of those afore-mentioned patriots if there was not a Council to throw back at them their advanced legislation " As Sir Julian Salomons and, members would have to be chloroformed before they would pass such a measure, which ought to be satisfactory to the labour delegates because it will enable them to clothe their thunder when next the subject comes up The bill was defeated by 30 votes to 1 by the way, the want of another member for the minority was strangely conspicuous-and its promoters can now redraft it and reintroduce it, and discuss it again, and send it to " another place rife not of This is the camp of battledore and shuttlecock known as politics . 6 2 6 . That was a curious conflict of possibilities and impossibilities the other day in a District Court in Queensland It was a case of larceny The jury, having been in retirement for nearly two hours, returned, and were told by the judge that it was impossible that they could agree upon the evidence before them They retired again, and returned five hours afterwards, and, as if to consult the Judge of rashness, said that there was no possibility of thou- agree- ing But the Judge had the whip hand. It was a Saturday, and he reminded them of a possibility in that case, viz that they might be locked up until the following Monday After that they retired again, and on returning after about three hours vindicated the Judge's insight by announcing that they were agreed But alas ' even then it turned out that judicial foresight, though sound on the surface, was worth less at the core In the circumstances it had been proved impossible for the jury to finally disagree But whereas the Judge had assumed the impossibility of avoiding a verdict of guilty, the only possible verdict with the jury was one of acquittal-a verdict which the Judge shortly of term ards pronounced to be corrupt 1 h it practically settled the matter, for when a man can say so much publicly, without fear of consequences, he must be left in possession of the field But still, it may be asked whether such a victory differs very much from a defeat What a jury will do under pressure is not always to be foreseen In this case, perhaps hail the summing-up ended in the middle of the week, the jury would have sought relief in proving that disagreement was not only possible, but the shortest way out of their difficulty 'to disagree leaves a case open to be tried again but when there is any tendency to shrink from the return of a verdict of guilty, said the door to dis- agreement is too firmly) shut, it may happen that a verdict of acquittal will be accepted as the easiest solution of the problem it is not always so, but considering the w weakness of human nature, that is a cause for surprise * . * . . Miss Essie Viola may be congratulated on her hairbreadth escape Many adventurers have had a bad quarter-of-an-hour, when " up in a bal- loon," but it has not been given to every one to be carried sky-high by a bag of flares, and then, after surveying the scene from a c Um seat on the trapeze, to descend gently under the sparks and the holder of a flaming parachute To the sympathetic observer it must have been a welcome sight when the heroine sprang out from the midst of the burning mass, and like Fitz James, " unwounded from the dreadful close, but breathless all," arose in safety But it is feared that this case may be not the end, but the beginning of troubles These are times in which men will struggle to gain distinction in the wildest ways, and what was so short a cut to glory as a fiery rise and a fiery descent, without showing a scratch or a single ? It must, however, be a delicate business to manage These fire balloons are treacherous and frosty There is a want of substantiality about them, and they may even disappear inopportunely in the midst of a puff of smoke how, would it not be better to experiment with tougher material and app trains, upon the regular working of which one could more surely roly ? It may be suggested that a fine ascent might be accomplished by means of a big rocket if one were tied or suspended to the stick The sticks are at least sure to come down, and may be trusted not to be dis- situated in mid air, and lea of their appendages to their fate . . . . Will the contest for supremacy between guns and armour-plates over cease The last thing we hear of is the discovery of a new hardening pro case which, tried at Krupp a works, gave extraordinary results Now we must watch for the production of some gun that will not burst with any charge, some powder the force of which is more desirable, and some bolts that, with the persuasive influence of the powder, will " go anywhere and do anything " Meanwhile there is a curious little piece of information that follow " the story about the hardened plates " Of all the foreign officers who had applied for permission to accompany the Chinese fleet. Germans alone had been allowed to make more minute inspection of the Chinesoships, which, it would be noted possessed a much greater power of resistance than the Japanese vessels The query that suggests itself is what is the value of great power of resistance) if it series only to save the ship for capture and use by a victorious enemy It would surely better for the beaten side if in a naval battle all its ships were blown to pieces than that their armour should so far protect them as to provide for the doubling of the strength of the Motor's navy There is one consolatory reflection for Englishmen at any rate Whether the guns or the armour plates have the better of it theoretical!) at the outbreak of the next great nay, all war, there is something to be said about the mon boland both of them It was the men who did it in the days of the Armada, and probably it will be the men who will do it when the next great sea fights come, but that does not exclude the possibility of the best guns and the best armour being also in British hands .

These two classes, though Striving with almost frantic effort to come closer to each other, never do so apparently The man who has a ton of zinc ridging to dispose of is pathetic in his pleading to the public to purchase, but he exhorts in vain Day after day one sees the melancholy legend, till at last, for Sheer pity's sake, one would like to go and purchase zinc ridging and use it as ornaments for the drawing- room, or great to the children for toys And yet, almost side by side, perhaps, with the announcement of the man of surplus metal will be that of him whose sole object in life appears to be to buy zinc ridging It is the same with everything else A widowed lady has a mangle to sell, and a few inches lower down a young wife once aloud for this particular instrument of household torture, a sporting gentleman wants a bulldog, and a father who is giving up his kennels is brutally ostentatious about the events of a magnificent brindle, a mous lady n anxious to purchase Blair's Sermons, and in mother column a butcher who is selling off would dispose of ser ora! volumes of thopnoelcs theologian cheap Buttboy noTorseem to get anyforrarler.aud across bridgeless chasms the messages be easily read by others sink into voiceless obhx ion The only conclusion seems to be that this kind of advertiser is an eccentric and peculiar species that requires erudite Investigation *, * . .
