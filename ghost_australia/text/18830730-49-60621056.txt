What is known as the 'Bracelet Meeting' of the Vic toria Amateur Turf Club caine off at Caulfield on the last day in June. The two great events of the day were the Victoria Gold Cup, for amateur riders, and the Ladies' ? Trophy, for which, event the horses were nominated by ladies. The events commenced with the Selling Race, which was won by Castaway, with Nymph second, and Whisper third. The Handicap Hurdle Race brought out a field of 10 horses, and notwithstanding the weight — list. 31b. — Mr. J. O. Inglis Avon the stake with Buzza, Triplet and Miller filling the other places. Only half-a-dozen started for the Victoria Gold Cup. Black Jacket was most fancied, and lie fully justified the confidence reposed in him, Abdallah being second, and Yerlo third. The Ladies' Trophy brought out the largest field of horses that over started, for a race in Australia, and only three short of the largost field in the world. When the 42 horses gathered at the post they presented a fine appearance, and although the start effected was not a good one, there have been many worse with much smaller fields. Transferred got the best of it, but lie only secured third place, the winner being The Ghost, with. Liddingtori second; Thirteen started for the Steeplechase, and Vaulter had the call in the betting. In the run home, however, he was passed by General Jackson, Napoleon being thirds ? Thus far in the football season no particular club has shown any decided superiority. Caxlton beat Essendon after a very even match on the 30th June, and Melbourne and Geelong played a drawn game. The Ports, a team from South Australia, were in Melbourne playing a series of matches, but were not up to the standard of the Victorian clubs. South Melbourne sent a team to Sydney and as the Victorian game is becoming very popular in the adjoining colonies, the Sydney club were enabled to play a very hard game with tho -visitors'. , ,
