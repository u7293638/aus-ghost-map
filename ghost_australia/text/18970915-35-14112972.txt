The President took, the chair nthnlf-past 10 o'clock. THE "BILL IN COMMIT THE MONEY HILLS There long no questions or petitions, the Convention resolved itself into of Committee of the Whole to further consider the Commonwealth Bill in detail Mr BARTON moved that clauses -H to li inclusive dealing with provisions relating to both Houses " and " powers of the Parliament," "he postponed to enable the committee to proceed with the causes leading to money bills according to the previous day's arrangement This was agreed to Clause 04, " Proposed laws having for their main object the appropriation of any part of the public revenue or moneys or the imposition of any tax or impost shall originate in the House of Representatives " " THE MAIN OBJECTS DIFFICULTY The CHAIRMAN said that the Legislature of New South Wales had suggested the omission of the words " having for their main object," aw? the in- sertion of the word " for " the Victorian Assembly had suggested the omission of the words " having for their main object the appropriation of " and the insertion of the word " appropriating also the omission of the words of the imposition of " and the insertion of the word " imposing " The Legislative Council of South Australia had suggested the omission of the 1 arise, and the Tasmanian Assembly had suggested the omission of the word *' main n Mr BARTON said they all felt that there was a great deal of indefiniteness about the words " having for their main object " AJI attempt had been made to get rid of that difficulty by the Legislative Arizona bly of Tasmania, which proposed to strike out the word "main," and add to the end of the clause the words, " but a proposed law which provides for the imposition and appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand and payment and appropriation of fees or licenses or for services, and does not otherwise impose any tax or appropriate any part of the public revenue, may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate " If it was the intention of the Convention to avoid that unnecessary trouble which occurred when the second Chamber dealt with anything that incident ally referred to license fees or charges, they might very well vote for an amendment of that kind Sir T S FYSH (Tas) asked who was to define the word " and " Was it to be the Provident of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or who was it to be Mr REID said removing the word " and " did not lessen the (Uflicultj In accordance with the suggestion read from the chair they could remove the words " having for their main object," leaving the form as in the '1891 bill 'Then they could adopt the very valuable suggestion of Tasmania giving the Senate power to introduce measures in which the imposition of a license was only an incident Mr. BRUNKER, suggested the omission of the word *' licenses " from the Tasmanian amendment The omission of the words " having for their main object " was agreed to on the voices Mr REID proposed a verbal amendment with the object of making the clause read Laws appropriating." He proposed to add words at the end of the clause which would make it more ex- plicit Mr HOLDER (S.A.) said that the amendment by Mr Reid would alter the whole purpose of the clause Mr. HIGGINS (Vic ) said that there was no desire to prevent the Senate from originating bills which incidentally imposed a line or feel Mr DOBSON (To ) Or which appropriate a ! small part of the revenue The CHAIRMAN said that he had first to put the proposed amendment by New South Wales omitting the words " having for their main object " and inserting the word " for " Mr. WISE said that this would bring the bill back to the wording of the 1891 bill Mr REID said that he intended to add the amendment proposed by Tasmania, providing that the Senate could impose fees, and so on. Mr HIGGINS said that he hoped that the word " for " would not be inserted in the bill. Mr. GLYNN (S.A.) said that he would like to see the clause read- Proposed laws having for their chief purpose " Mr. MCMILLAN Who is to decide what is the chief purpose of the law of Mr GLYNN It might finally have to be decided by the Supreme Court Mr HIGGINS We want to prevent all such points being raised Mr DOBSON (Tas) said he understood that when at the Adelaide Convention they departed from the bill of 1891 by allowing the Senate to be elected by a direct vote of the people, and refused that Chamber the power to amend money hills the Com- clifton desired to give it a quid pro quo in tho shape of the words " having for the r main object, which would enable the Senate to initiate bills that did not appropriate mode), impose taxation, or deal with loans It was now urged by Mr Higgins and other members that that power should he cut down u The Tasmanian amendment sought to give the Senate power to initiate a bill that involved the payment for services tendered, as for instance, the payment of a clerk or secretary but if the present amendment victo agreed to the Senate would be deprived of that power Sir JOHN FORREST' It would require a message from the Governor-General to introduce such a bill Mr DOBSON Yes, and the Minister in the Senate could bring down the message Mr FRASER (Vie 1 said he was in favour of the Tasmanian amendment, and would also allow the Senate power to give bonuses A DIFFICULT i Or DEFINITION Mr M'MILLAN said that whilst they knew what bills they desired to give the Senate power to initiate-bills that incidentally implied the expenditure of money the difficulty it is to define them in the clause (Hear, hear ) They were anxious to meet the difficulty but they must be very careful to prevent misunderstandings in the future as to what were and what were not money hills (Hear, hear ) He thought the High Court was the only tribunal which could decide which was a money hill and which was not but it seemed to him that if a definition was desired, the Tasmanian nineudtnoiit was too nearest approach they could make to a compromise, though he held that its adoption would very much reduce the power of the Senate Mr KINGSTON said he would support the amendment for the insertion of the word " for " because it was in the South Australian Constitution and had been found to work well. The addition of the word proposed by Jason and would have the effect of preventing the friction that had occurred in the past in regard to what hills which incidentally imposed expenditure could be initiated in the Upper Chamber Mr BARTON said he was of opinion that the provisions of the hill of 1891 were the fairest on the whole in the interests of the different colonies and constitutional government, but he was prepared to accept the addition proposed by I usrunnia, as it was a step beyond the 1891 bill hear, hear-and secured to the Senate a degree of individuality which it would be a scandal to deprive it of (Hear, hear.) Mr.. REID said that inasmuch as the word " for " had created unending disputes between two Houses in one Australian Parliament, he strongly urged that it should not be inserted Sir JOHN DOWNER said that in the interests of the Senate it would be much better to retain the words ""having for their many object ' as it would enable it to initiate bills that could not be dealt with by that Chamber if the w ones were omitted. Mr BARTON said the proposal would be merely the adoption of a standing Order of the House of Commons and had been frequently availed of by the House of Lords in dealing with bills that incidental!) proposed expenditure The motion to insert the word " for " was negatived without a div sion The amendments to point the words " the imposition of " with a view of in- serting " imposing' was carried. Mr. Reid's amendment to substitute " appropriating " of " the appropriation of " was agreed to Mr DOBSON said he desired to call attention to the fact that it appeared to him that the word " services in the addition to the clause proposed by Tasmania ought to come out or to have something ' put before it ° A SKILFUL DEVICE Mr CARRUTHERS said that the proposed adds . tion was a very skilful device to largely increase the powers of the Senate By the words " appropriation of fees for licenses or for services " they were proposing to hand over powers which were not conferred on the manner at Adelaide The taxation received from the mining industry was in the form of licenses The Ti whole of the postal revenue, more over would be placed in the hands of the Senate equally with the House of Representatives A large portion of the revenue of the Commonwealth would be from fenn Lor sir nets Sir GEORGE TURNER They must always pet a G Governor's message before the e in may c Mr CARRUTHERS said that they would be fit for pilot seniors in the colony, besides 5 'ft d life If they were going to whittle away the powers of the House of Roorrspntntives wiMiief but to f sure they raightns well concede the Mil Italian in ii no Hit Senate co-ordinate powers w as stations Ko proposed to omit the sort of M du - «w 61 for services with a view to insert " in of i e ' Mr BARTON owl Out had I not ftnuripitc is of the damages from the amendment pro owed b> Tasmania. which Hfeimd O line susgMtad them SolvwitoMi Ctuurhern He did not know that there was anything which might killing anyone who, like hands, war A strong believer in the power of the pin so long came in one Hand!

Doubtless they would be threatened with the statement that if these words were struck out there would be no federation That was the usual course pursued by the larger colonies Mr REID You have never threatened ? Sir JOHN FORREST No Mr REID And I'll tell you the reason You have always had your own way (Laughter ) ADVICE TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIMIT 'THE SENATE Sir JOHN" FORREST said that he could not see that the larger colonies had anything to fear with regard to this federation, since they were quite strong enough to hold their own in the future as they had done in the past He could not understand why they should take up this position in oven matter in which the smaller colonies desired to make the Senate strong Without his knowledge, and in his absence from the Convention, it had been sought to introduce a 1 rule providing that the elections to the House of Representatives should be on the basis of one man one vote, a system which did not exist in many of the colonies at present Yet New South Wales and Victoria had been strong enough to ask these colonies to altogether change their constitu- tion with regard to the franchise The smaller States were asked to give way in everything The larger States seemed to be afraid of having a strong Senate, and seemed to think that the Senate would be similar to the existing Upper Houses in the colonies Now they desired that the power to amend taxation bills should be denied to the Senate But there could be no reason why a House elected by the whole people as one constituency should not be trusted with these powers Of course the power of v etc was an important matter, but it was not always possible to exercise it He would like to ask a whether a State in a State had any interest whatever in the way in which it should be taxed If hon members admitted that it had some right in that regard they could not very well deny to the Senate the power to amend a taxation bill in the House of Representives the representatives of the small States would be small in number as compared with those of the larger States, and they would have no great force in the way in which a State would be call ed There fore the only place in which a State could have an influence in regard to the mode of taxation must be the Senate There could be no fear on the part of the larger States as to the smaller States combining against them. It was not easy to get a combination Was it not more likely that the smaller states would be altogether dominated by the larger ones 9 The large population and the surrounding public opinion of the place in which the Federal Parliament would meet would be an ill clent to prevent any such combination being carried out even if it could be formed Nor did he think the small States had much to tear from a combination of the large ones There was, however, a fear among the t>m ill States that they had to meet Apart from its unfairness, his great objection to limiting the powers of the Senate as proposed was that it was as the outcome of a desire to stamp the Senate as an inferior body Many hon members desired that the Senate must not open the money bills and to that he did not object that it might not amend taxation bills and to that he did object and that it should have no power over the Executive I have, had made some concessions, and now it was desired to take away the power of amending taxation bills The le others of the antis Senate movement desired to make the Senate an inferior and discredited body The prerogatives which the House of Representatives already possessed should be sufficient, without taking away the one thing the States wanted, it? that their representatives in the San its should have the power of amend- ing taxation bills those who desired to limit the powers of the Romans so much should go for sweep- ing it away altogether Some hon. members also desired to give the power of dissolving the Senate, and to give J. referendum against the decision of the Senate lucy had better not have any Senate at all of than that Sir JOHN DOWNER (b A ) Hear, hear Get a newspaper from each colony, that would be the way (Laughter ) Sir JOHN FORREST said they had often had put before them the constitution of the United states as the United States Senate a weak and. i discredited body s Mr. TRENWItH (Vic ) Discredited, not weak Sir JOHN FORREST said the hon. member knew very little about it the United S is for Senate I was elected by the Legislatures It could not be I dissolved It had equal powers with the House of Representatives Mr IREN WItH And it works Tammany ' rings Sir JOHN I ORllEbT said it was one of the best legislative bodies in the world It had the power of controlling the Executive Government It had stood the test of time Had it curtailed the liberties of the people of Mr IREN Wil is less Sir JOHN I ORItrsi Had it impeded the progress of the United States 9 Mr 1RLN Willi Yes Sir JOHN FORREST said the contrary was the case He hoped those who fought this question at Adelaide would stand to their colours now A MESSAGE FROM IHfii TASMANIANS Sir PHILIP FYSH said that since April last federation had found many, friends in New South Wales and Victoria, and it had been shown that many of these had been willing to make concessions for the purpose of of securing the union of the colonies The smaller States should try) to co-operate with those who had shown a desire to concede on important points, in order that those States might not be charged with working together to gain particular , rights He recognised that the interests of the smaller States were wrapped up in the larger States I They ought to be put pawn, in a great question of this kind, to leave to the judgment of those who formed the le local Parliament the matter of dealing withdrew many of the questions which now came before them they ought to be prepared to trust the more mature judgment of that body, which would endeavour to secure the good of the people as a whole, and not the good of my p particular State. He was charged with message from the people of Tasmania to try if possible, to secure in this bill the port or to the Senate townsend money bills There was a large number of the legislators of Tasmania who were as strongly determined as Sir John Forrest to secure to the Senate the power van which he was advocating But he was compelled to ask himself the question, 1\ but is cr as they approached the close of the Contention, if concessions were to be made, they should not be made now ? (Hear, hear ) The smaller States could not expect to have every thing their own way but the smaller States would not federate at all if, on some important mut tors, their views had not been conceded there had been great concessions made Sir J DOWNER Concessions made by us Sir PHILIP FYSH They were there as States, having the same power by reason of the concession made that they should be represented by the same numbers in the Senate (Hear, hear.) They were not prepared to Uko federation at too great a price But when I hey had the olive branch held out to tin or, as it had been, by New South Wales, it seemed to him that the time had come when they should concede something to those who had striven to make concessions to them (Hear, hear.) He hoped that some of his colleagues from Tasmania would join with the line who voted with the majority at Adc Inilo on this question It was not a matter that ought to be passed by a narrow momently They should either reverse the decision come to at Adelaide 01 make the man sent a much larger one He thought that the power given to the Senate to make suggestions was really a power to make amendments He thought that as they proceeded with the bill they would draw nearer and near together, and would finally come to some g liberal understanding on matters Mr SYMON Dunn that he adhered entirely to the view she expressed on this subject it the Adelaide Convention it still appeared to him that the direct power of amending money bills was of great moment to the strength and dignity of the Senate and he agreed with Sir John Forrest that to give up the power was an acknowledgment, to a certain extent, of inferiority to the other Chamber with regard to a certain class of hills Whilst adhering to those views, he had however, come to the conclusion that the power was not absolutely essential to the exercise of the functions of the Senate, and that, though short of it, that body might still hold with effect a great and patriotic position in the counsels of the nation in those circumstances he had resolved to support the clause as it stood (Hear, hear J Sir JOHN DOWNER said the position which he had taken and which he intended to maintain, was that the Senate and the House of Representatives should possess co-ordinate powers, which should only cease when some question of convenience made a departure from it necessary and leaving to the House of Representatives as the sole power of engines mg taxation bills If they put the brand of inferiority on one House at the start, with all the surroundings to induce greater inferiority, it would degenerate When speaking in Adelaide h said that so far from giving the Senate less power he would, if he saw his way to do it, give it greater post er than the House of Representatives, because the latter was bound to be marvellously powerful, representing the great body of the people, and having both numbers, influence, and the pressure of public opinion behind it The power of the House of Representatives would be almost absolute, and the Australian Senate would not have, like the American Senate, those large outside powers which practically gave it its dignity and enabled it to retain the equality of its position WHAT CONSTITUTION BRITISH OR AMERICAN TYPEs Mr REID said that we must abandon the idea of framing a perfect constitution and we must also get rid of such mere phrases as " Federal " and " Commonwealth," and of our slavish veneration for the constitution of the United States. The Senate of the United States had done good in its time, but' the trend of public opinion was towards the view that it had been overprinted The reputation of the United States Senate was much lower to day than it had been 10 years ago, and deservedly so The amendment proposed by Sir John Forrest was a most calamitous one. It claimed for the Senate the power of imposing taxa- tion Sir John Forrest was really a typical English- man but when it came to framing a federal constitution he was a downright Yankee. Laughter ) Sir John Forrest was always talking about the Senate of the United States of" America, but we were not framing a constitution for the American but for the Australian people Many of those who now supported Sir John Forrest would take a very different view of the matter if it were discussed as between the two Houses of their own colonies in all the colonies, with possibly the exception of Tasmania, an absolute destruction was made in the Constitution between the rights of the House which directly represented the great body of the people and the lights of the House which either represented the people in some lesser degree of was appointed What would Sir John Forrest say if the Upper House in Western Australia attempted to amend his money bills a Why, the hon member would express himself in language which would quite satisfy any of them (Laughter) The principle recognised in the constitution of the Australian colonies was the difference between the powers of the two Houses, and that difference arose simply from the proposition that inasmuch as the taxes were paid by the people it was the right of the representatives of those who were taxed to dispose of the moneys that was the whole principle of the British Constitution as it was now understood, and it was so firmly established in Great Britain that the House of Lords, fearless as it was in dealing with attempted innova- tions passed without a division measures, of taxation which seemed almost directly aimed of their class That was the principle upon which our constitution rested, and it was a principle that the people of the Australian colonies would be the last to give up in the management of their colonial aft airs Now he had to come away from that, and admit that in forming a federal constitution they must deviate to some extent But could they deviate so far as they were asked to do ' in the course of that , instead of New South Wales and Victoria possessing the largest pot station, Queensland and Western Australia might be the most populous His argument would apply just as well to such a state of things The reason he opposed this amendment was one absolutely away from the circumstances of his own colony The principle he urged was absolutely the basic principle of ever) constitution of the British type Was this to he a federal constitution of the British type or of the American type ' As far as he could judge the people of Australia, they would infinitely prefer a federation of the British type, although there must be some deviation A federation of that type would be more likely to be accepted because it was the type in which the Australian people had been born and bred and which they had administered in these colonies It he was asked to throw away this basic principle of finance and adopt the methods of the American Legislature he had to say that he had not the remotest hope of inducing the people of this colony to adopt it. The financial history of the American Legislature was by no means a satisfactory one. While that country was deriving an enormous revenue from an extremely high tariff there was no difficulty The difficulty was to spend it, and this was solved by a brilliant stroke of federal finance which couv ertoJ this surplus into pensions They saw nuances managed by two Houses with a model Senate, and yet instead of this acting as a check upon extravagance millions of money were squan- dered He was prepared to surrender many of his opinions so long as equal control of the money of the taxpayer was not given to the Senate Sir JOHN FORREST No one asked that Mr REID Then what did this amendment mean C A House which had the power by constitutional law to amend a taxation bill was given power to control the taxation of the country Sir JOHN FORREST Not to spend it TAXATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH. Mr REID said certainly it was some importance to the people how they were taxed T no difficulty was to get the money first, not to spend it. The question for the people was How are you going to raise from us the taxation of the Commonwealth r" If Sir John Forrest would say " We will have equality, we will have equal voting, and vic will bring into the Commonwealth as much money as you that would be equality Let each colony agree that the expenses of the Commonwealth would be contributed equally and then they would have no more trouble But if they put upon the people as a whole taxation which they paid as individuals, if they nationalised the area and burden of taxation, they must nationalise the power of the public purse i he could not call the people a nation in order to take money out of their pockets, and then call them a federation so that the majority representing those who contributed a tithe of the amount should have an equal power That was a federation they could never yield to They proposed a federal Parliament that would put all the people together for taxation, with a Peiinto which would have 18 senators representing a smaller number and 12 representing the larger number The 18 senators, could amend tax tion bills though they represent a small minority of the whole Commonwealth That was a state of things to which they could never bring a British community Sir S Griffith never put forward this claim on behalf of the smaller states This was one of the points on which the larger States could not give way There were other points on which the sun ther colonies could not yield equal representation in the Senate was one of these the larger Mites conceded this willingly notwithstanding that the Legislatures were in favour of proportional representation Mr HOWE moved that the question be now put The motion was negatived on the voices, and the debate proceeded POSITION OF THE SMALLER STATES Sir EDWARD BRADDON said he thought that the fe ou ato would represent tho whole of the States, and would thus be as representative as the House of Representatives But they had to deal with the power of the Senate in one particular Some members had said that the difference between the power of amendment and the power of suggestion was the difference between a eedledum and two Hence If that were so, why did not the larger States give way p (Laughter ) the smaller States dare not yield on this question Sir W 7EAL Then we had better go home (Laughter ) Sir EDWARD BRADDON He knew that some members were desirous of obtaining some solution of the difficulty with regard to a deadlock That was a question on which the smaller but rates were prepared to grant a concession Sir W ZEAL We do not want the referendum Sir EDWARD BRADDON said that he meant by way of dissolution that would be enough to keep any Senate in order (Laughter ) Mr. DOUGLAS (In) said he still adhered to his contention at Adelaide that the Senate should hat a co ordinate power with the House of Repre- sentatives in all matters He was in favour of federation, but would not accept it at any price, and if the proposed constitution was not suitable to Tasmania he would go from one end of the island to the other and advise the people not to join the federation Mr CLAltKr (The ) said that as one of the representatives at A delay du who voted with the object of giving the Senate the power of amending money bills, he desired to (date the reasons why he was going to give a different vote on the present occasion (Hear, hear ) He] considered that just as the granting of the principle of equal representation of the States in the Senate was a practical necessity or federation it was a practical precocity that the s muller colonies should give a in to the larger ones upon this very spot tant matter. The representatives of New South Wales and Victoria had told them that their people would not agree to any scheme in which the Senate had co-ordinate power in the matter of amending money bills, He yielded to their a tutor ments and thought that the scheme of 1891 which was ratified in 1897" at Adelaide, was fair to the smaller States and would bring them no dishonour. BUILD UPON A STRONG DOUN DATION Mr CARRUTHERS said he held that the smaller colonies had not sacrificed anything which would be any gain to the larger ones At Adelaide mmc densely after these clauses were dealt ith members were met by the statement that a compromise had been arrived at, and they must abide by it. He would not hesitate to grant Sir John Forrest and those who voted with him to odin ite pim ors in the two Houses giving them that which they in agreed to be the substance but which he took to be the shadow if they would grant in return that when those co ordinate powers conflicted and the situation was being strained there should be some outlet in which the people themselves might voice then on mons and have the right to impose their own will and frame their own laws An hon member had stated that the attempts made upon vain us clauses were attempts to detract from the influence of the Senate He however, desired to see the Senate a strong body but they would "at that strength by building upon a strong foundation line could have been obtained by electing the Senate on the broadest basis The weakness of the Senate arose from that which they had already done, and that element of weakness would follow it throughout its existence He hoped that there would be no compact made in this vote which would tie their hands or interfere with the votes hereafter of those who desired to have some real, vital principle embodied in the bill which in cases of course it would allow the voice of the people to be paramount Mr "WISE said he hoped that the speeches made by representatives of small colonies and the votes given would remove the impression Mr Carruthers had that an attempt was going to be made for the small colonies to combine against the large ones Recognising the interests of Australia the representatives of the smaller colonies had to give way upon matters regarding which many of their electors did not see eye to eye with themselves but he believed that they would succeed in convincing them that they acted in the best interests of Australian unity as they were certain that in New South Wales they would be able to convince the people that equal representation was a practical necessity Mr HACKETT (WA) said he admitted that they must commence with what was called responsible government, and he admitted the glorious fruits of that term of government but he could not shut his eyes to the fact that they were entering upon an unknown sea, that they were creating a constitution in which almost everything was made fruits, and that they had little in the past to argue from and nothing in the future but the purest efforts of imagination He had always been doubtful about limiting the pow ers of the Senate As to the grant- ing of equal representation in the Senate being a magnificent procession lie on behalf of his own colony repudiated that idea with all the energy of which he was capable He was sure that not one of the smaller colonies would have been represented at the Convention if equality of representation were not granted Mr HIGGINS (Vic ) It seems that ghost is not laid yet It will come up again ME/LLING THE MINERS Mr HACKETT said that Mr Higgins settled things very fast, and many of the things he settled unsettled themselves as quickly He (Mr. Hackett) congratulated the Convention that the hon. member had not been able to settle these matters and settle the Convention at the same time I he concession of equal representation might mean much, or it might mean absolutely nothing Everything depended on the power and rights conceded to the body invested with this equal representation What was the use of inviting five men to dinner and including three of them J He did not look with any theoretical dead upon this power of suggestion The objection he saw to it was that, being less important, less dignified, and less authoritative, it would come with less weight from the body compelled to use it If however, he found that the right of amendment stood in the way of federation, he would not weigh it in his mind for a moment before he surrendered it Mr DOBSON (Tas) said that it had been stated that almost every member of the Convention went before the electors on the principle of equal representation yet the, found both Houses of Parliament in New South Wales absolutely opposed to the principle Thus it was all very well to talk about the will of the people being reflected in the Legislature While passion and party feeling existed he defied anyone to say what the will of the people was It must be remembered that in the Federal Parlia- ment we were not dealing with a nominee House, but with a popular House He (Mr Dobson was prepared to meet the other colonies on the vital point of saving some process of doing away with deadlocks between the two Houses but only on the condition that there was a strong Senate, and one that would have some control over the demon otic forces which were hurrying us on far too fast But we were discussing federation in the most cumbersome way that the wit of man could devise It the Convention were to shut its door that moment and to sit in private he was satisfied that they could arrive at some basis of settlement and then go home it need be to stump the country Mr BARTON And then they would not look at you Mr DOBSON said that two of the first money bills to be considered by the Federal Parliament would be those dealing with federal defence and with the federal tariff An expenditure of two or three millions might be asked for defences, and the Senate might wish to reduce it to one million yet it could not do so So with the tariff It could not reduce one single one of the 300 or 400 items It must either pass the bills or put them into the waste paper basket FEDERATION WITH CONFIDENCE Mr HENRY (Tas ) said that the decision on the point was a foregone conclusion the reasons which caused him to vote on the side of the majority at Adelaide still continued Indeed, force had been added to those reasons If the smaller colonies defeated the larger ones on this question they would, he thought, impede federation He was glad that certain of his colleagues had come round to his own way of thinking Even with the senate departed of the right to amend money bills Australia might enter into the federation with confidence The only remaining stumbling block was caused by the financial clauses, but he hoped that some satisfactory arrangement would be come to with regard to this matter Mr JAMES (WA) and he demanded equal representation in the Senate as a right At the same time he should vote for the clause as it stood, being, as it was, the compromise arrived at in 1891 He should vote this way because he desired to see federation, and he did not think that the smaller colonies would suffer by the arrangement Mr. HIGGINS (Vic ) said he was astonished to hear the reason given by Mr. Dobson why the Senate should be made a strong body by giving it the power to amend money bills It was, he said, to enable the bonate to check the will of the people " Sir JOHN DOWNER You are not quoting his remarks of early Mr HIGGINS I appeal to the hon. member (Mr Dobson) it he did not use those words Mr BARTON To control the democratic forces Laughter Mr. DOBSON I said a Senate should be strong in order to prevent the House of Representatives going too fast Mr HIGGINS said the hon member would cover make a strong Senate to enable it to carry out the people s will unless the senators were elected on the principle of proportional representation. Although members might have murdered proportional representation they could not get rid of its ghoSt. They could not give equal powers to tax bills to a body that was not elected according to population Mr FRASER (Vic ) said he could not support the amendment of Western A Australia, because the people of Victoria would never allow the Senate the power of amending money bills Mr MOORE (Tas ) said he considered that a Senate of a federation should have more power than a Senate of a unified government, hence the Australian Senate should be of power to amend money bills He would be prepared to give an ay even that right if he had a guarantee that the other powers of the Senate would not be whittled away ; but they had no guarantee that those powers would not be emasculated by engrafting on the constitution the double dissolution and referendum In view of these circumstances he would vote for the amendment PUBLIC OPINION A TRANSLATION OF GOODWILL Mr BARTON said he intended to vote against the amendment, and to adhere in these clauses to the provisions that were agreed to in 1891, and again in Adelaide in 1897 It must not he understood that he urged the acceptance of those pro visions because they were adopted in 1891 His opinion was that they should be accepted because they were a reasonable arrangement, embodying the best adjustment of the question of money bills It had been argued that either federation must kill responsible gol argument or responsible government must kill federation, but he did not think that that argument should deprive them of the hope of making such an adjustment between the federal idea and the spirit of responsible government as would enable them to have federation without an undue inroad upon the rights of individual States He was a little disappointed to hear Mr. Dobson talk of controlling the democratic forces They must have regard for opinion out of doors (Hear, hear ) public opinion in favour of this scheme was only a translation of goodwill They must rest this movement on the goodwill of the colonies, or it would collapse. He should be the last to utter a word in the sense of a threat, but strong regard must be had for the position of those two colonies whose combined populations numbered nearly two millions and a half out of the total population represented by the gentlemen assembled in that Chamber He was sure that he would be acquitted of speaking with what was called bluiT If they were to grant power to the Senate to amend taxation bills the result would be the failure of the scheme (Hear, hear ) They had educated the people of New South Wales so far as to cause them to understand that in a Federal Government there must be some adjustment of the separate entries in the interests of federation, but they had not educated them to the idea-and they would not try to educate them to the idea-that federation meant the abandonment of that system of responsible gm eminent which they believed to be the actual outcome of the true democratic feeling which every one of them considered it his duty to conserve They could not by accepting this amendment of urtliGi the cause of feder item He believed that the people of New South Wales and of Vic long would accept the principle of equal representa- tion in the Senate if they did not had such powers 33 Would make the system of responsible government, as they understood it, thoroughly unwork- able, but that if they did and those powers they would not accept that principle Mr Dobson said that they were wasting time in a discussion of this kind, because it they were, sitting with closed doors they might come to an arrangement which would embody a general scheme of federation that would be accepted out of doors if they sat with closed doors they might not make such long speeches, and they might, as had been said, come to an arrangement more quickly but the difficulty would be this, that the constitution would be so much waste paper, because no population in any of these colonies would approach it except for the purpose of kicking it How could it be expected that the people of these colonies would content to have a constitution male behind their backs ? He granted that there might be committees to form propositions but then it would be the duty of the Convention to have those proposi- tions openly debated If they were to have two Houses, and intended to act upon the principles of responsible government and conserve those principles, they ought not to put into the ho ends of the Senate the power to utterly destroy the financial policy A the Government (Hear, hear.) He quite admitted that destruction might be a worked in some cases by veto but that involved a much greater re- sponsibility The Second Chamber might consider ten times before it vetoed anything, where it would not consider once in amending it. It was proposed to put into the hands of a body something about which there would not be so much responsibility, hut which by repetition would be as destructive Supposing a sum of £300,000 or £100,000 was considered absolutely necessary for the government of the country, and the amount was cut down by the Senate by a half, what would become of the A] proposition Bill' The power of suggestion differed very seriously from the power of amendment in this respect that it placed the respon sub lily on the right shoulder (Hear, hear.) He impressed on the Chamber to pursue the same course taken in Adelaide With proper safeguards he believed the principle of the bill might be accepted by all the colonies A PLEA FOR CONCESSIONS Mr GI YNN (S.A.) said that he was sorry to hear Sir John Forrest say that the object of the larger colonies was to gradually weaken the Senate, and perhaps finally do away with it altogether The fact that the "V Victorian Assembly had adopted the principle of the bull was the answer to the allegation that it the smaller States gave way now they would be paving the way to the asking of fresh concessions He contended that as a matter of expediency the denial of the power or of amendment to the Upper House could not be justified He believed that if the concession were not granted the cause of federation would be very much endangered Dr COCKBURN (S.A.) said that he had no reason to explain his vote at length, because he was going to vote the same way as he had voted in 1891, in 1897 and as he would alway s vote on this subject, in the interest of liberalism"Decau»e he regarded the maintenance of the State entity as the safeguard of democracy The Senate would be just as democratic a body as the House of Representatives, and would be the safeguard of democracy The amendment was then put and negatived by 28 votes to 19 The division was an follows - FOR THE AMENDMENT South Australia Dr Cockburn, Gordon, Holder, Howe, Solomon, Sir John Downer Tasmania Dobson, Grant, Douglas, Moore Western Australia - Sir John Forrest, Sir James Lee Steere, Leake Hackett, Hassell, Briggs, Crowder Heading, and Venn AGAINST THE AMENDMENT New South Wales -Sir J P Abbott, Barton, Brunker, Carruthers, Lyne, M'Millan, Reid, Walker, and Wise Victoria Sir Graham Berry, Deakin, Fraser, Higgins, Isaacs, Peacock, Trenwith, Sir George Turner Dr Quick, and Sir William Zeal South Australia - Glynn, Kingston, Symon Tasmania Brown, Clarke, Sir R O Fysh, Henry, and Lewis Western Australia James PAIRS For the amendment Sir E Braddon Against the amendment Mr GEO Connor The clause was agreed to Progress was reported and leave was given to the committee to sit again Mr HOLDER said he would like to know when clause 52 would be taken, and the clauses relating to powers of the Executive Mr BARTON said he proposed to consult the feeling of the Convention is to the order in which the subjects would be taken The Convention would sit on the following evening and the clauses mentioned might come on then He was not aware what the Finance Committee was doing, but as Sir George Turner had to go on Saturday the Finance Committee might hasten their sitting, and allow the Convention to discuss some of the clauses before Sir George Turner returned to Melbourne Sir RICHARD BAKER said he thought it would be wise if they finished the constitutional provisions first Air BARTON sold if Mr Holder would agree to it he would be willing to go on with the constitutional questions on the following night Mr HOLDER Hear, hear. Mr BARTON said he would remind members that it was proposed to sit on Wednesday night and Friday night ADJOURNMENT The Convention at 10 minutes to 6 adjourned at 10.30 a.m. on the following day.
