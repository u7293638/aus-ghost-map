EARLY HISTORY OF ST. ANDREW'S CATHEDRAL. In view of the importance attaching to the ecclesiastical function which was carried out yesterday, and the general interest awakened by the installation of the fourth Primate of Australia, the following particulars of the inception and the early history of the mother church of the diocese, will doubtless be road with interest - The Cathedral Church of St Andrew dates from as far back as the month of August, 1849, when Governor Macquarie laid the original foundation-stone of After that proceeding there was a cessation of the work for some considerable time, owing, It is believed, to the funds having been diverted to a building of a parochial character It is an interesting fact that the present Dean of Sydney, the Very Rev W M Cowper, was present when the first foundation-stone was laid During the long time that (he project remained more or less in abeyance a change in the silo was for some cause decided upon, which necessitated the relaying of the foundation stone many years afterwards St James's Church was commenced and took precedence of the projected Cathedral At this time and until the year 1895 the present diocese of Sydney formed part of the diocese of Calcutta In 1846 the late Dr Broughton was consecrated Bishop of Australia, and in the following year, on the return of that prelate to Sydney, he reverted to the design which had been initiated by Governor Macquarie The foundation-stone was then relaid by Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor, on May 10, 1847 The constructor made some slight progress after (be rosin ception of the undertaking in 18,17, but from a variety of causes the work was not proceeded with as fast as might have been expected in the earlier part of the history of the Church, the architect was James Hume, but on his decease he was succeeded in 1846 by Mr. E T Blacket, who made several alterations in the architectural details, and greatly modified and improved the entire plan In 1846 a committee was formed for the purpose of building (be Cathedral, and that committee carried on the work until its final completion and consecration on November 30, 1863 The projected, edifice had been delayed by the death in England of Bishop Broughton in 1853, and the unavoidable delay that followed pending the appointment of his successor, Bishop Barker. On his arrival renewed energy was displayed It was resolved that St Andrew's Cathedral should be completed for use. The work steadily progressed, being materially assisted by the large contribution of leading colonists who subscribed towards your special object In connection with it, such as the stained glass windows, carved woodwork, pulpit, and other similar details The cathedral will, of course, bear no comparison in point of size with the great ocoleal-tlcal structures in the old country, some of which, like Winchester Cathedral, date back to the times of the Saxon kings and the Benedictine monks, but in its appropriate decoration and Internal arrangements it is considered by competent judges to bear favourable comparison with., many fine, edifices of . far greater else.
