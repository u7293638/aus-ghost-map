The place was full . of uncanny associations—as the hi- i ig-plaee of tbe runaway slaves, I ho hotbed of malaria and all manner of ills and achcsV At length the crowning ill •was jiut upon it when, it became the abode of the Graysville ghost. True, these stories of the ghost never, for a long while at least, got bByond the quarters; but there' they wereirehearsed night alter night with startling and blood-curdling Variations. : It was said that nothing ever came out bf the swamp alive; even the cattle wandering within its deadly limits were either stung to .death by the poisonous reptiles there or else broketbeir necks among the.tangles of bain boo and rattans crdssvine and swinging mosses of the swamp. I. was.alniays inortally afi-iiid of the swamp, and no hunian power conic 1 have persuaded hie beyond the separating waters of the 1 agoon.

Dick, ah old slave who had disappeared months before and was supposed to bp dead somewhere in tho impenetrable depths- of the Dismal Swamp. Hehad,.indeed,-abeenthere all the while, living upon the wild plums and berries which grew in profusion.: He returned to His ffidibg..; place and died there, his dead body having been discbvered Tjy seeing thebuzzards circling about it on the farther bank of the lag'oon. \- - "Literally tornvto. pieces by. tho witches, 4,1 they, said/ in. the cabins of the superstifons blacks, who repudiated the existence of • the -briars for the more tlirilTing- idea;of.-witches. : Froni that time forward tho ghost' of.Grazy Bickvras said, to -wander • about tie swamp, and could be seen almost^any night, "all''in while," crossing' the. lagoon;and -the rice . field and coming on across th.e lawn to the : graveyard, where ho- disappeared " jnst at rda,y]ight," in his own grave m. :theifaK comer: .of the > -lot ".over to'ds the: great.
