The Best Season for Bream. TO THE BDITOB OF THE AUSTRALASIAN. Sir,-Having noticed in your two last issues (hat "Pike" and "Izaak's Ghost" are under the impression that the bream fishing season is nearly out, I beg to be allowed to state that such is not the case. The bream season lasts nearly all the year round. July and August are the only months during which bream are not killed to any great exteat. I have found from personal experience, and many anglers veil versed in the habits of this fish will bear me out in my statement^ that more bream are killed during the months of April, May, and June than in any other three months in the year. AttheWerribee, in June, 1864, three of us caught thirty-two dozen, from ilb. up to lib., the result of ten hours' sport. That did not look as if " the season were out," but rather the contrary. Yesterday I caught fourteen, weighing 91b.-some of them were Â£lb. each-in three hours, and had I not boen necessitated to return to town early, I should have more than doubled my " take" in less than two hours. This |was at Raleigh's Punt. I commenced about three o'clock p.m., and fished until nearly six p.m. I am. Sir, yours, &c.;, PISCATOR No. 1. P.S.-Can " Pike" or " Isaacs G-host," or any of your correspondents, inform me if they have ever had any good takes by moonlight; if eo, at what time, moon's age, &c.;
