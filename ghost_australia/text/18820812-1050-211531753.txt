IMMUTABILITY OF THE CHURCH OP ROME. 0: ; ? ' 'TKADtTIOh ' AKD; hBtEjl-OPMEMiT . One of the greatest difficnlties-'lthat- Protestants have to contend against dn their controveries with Roman Catholics is,' to ascertain ;what is, and what- is npti the authoritative teaching of the Church of Rome. That there should bo any doubt upon so fundamental a point, especially in the case of a Church which claims to be infallible, may be a novel and startling statement to those 'oif-' pur ' Roman Catholic readers who implicitly b'e- ! lieve that the doctrines of their Church" are fixed; unchanged, and unchangeable— J the same now as in the first ages of Christi anity;- and destined to remain 'Without' a)! ahat(ie of variation to the - end' ofi'tim'el," Nor is ' it; indeed,'!at';all >'8nrpri8irig jthat':/ they -'should ' believe itiiis. -They /have heard it .vreiterated ai| thousand- times' that " Home- i.s, immutable;'! lindirthey! very naturally' acquiesce iu tho truth" of: an : assertion which, : iwhile : ? it /' seems i to- invest their own -Chnrchhvith: pue-df -the' sublimest -of all attribnte.s, /implies, lat the ! same timb, that , every :! other form "of / Christian /profession, 'must/ be,- /frpm'-' its very. nature, novel and; transitoryi/;'/ Our;/ object in the present - article i8',tb<i8h"owt that this idea of the immutability of rthb' teaching of the Chnrch'of Rome', is a mere'- illusion. ; And in proof of this .position,'/ we shall / not enter . upon a detailednex-ii amination of tho' -various pdriioular p'ointa on which she has changed, but "we i shall- limitiourselves to the consideration! bf one greafr yenijrai question, . which virtually includes all the rest— viz;, / Has -.the Church . pf Rome adhered - invariably/ to/ theisame opinion respecting- the Jluleiof ' TaitluTij -?-!,! v/'.-rcc-J/u o-;/.)!'''- .Upon, this fundamental point, be jasserii! that thededcliing ofi. the modern f Ghuroh'.' of': Rome is diametrically 'opp6sed;tdttlie>eled/r.i and : formal' t decisions ot.

And la'stiy,'even lieilarmiiie, tbe,. great champion of Tridentine EomanisBif and, consequently, .a zealous upholder of the Tridentine theory, yet finds himself compelled to admit that the " stability of all dogmas depends on the authority of the existing cliarch" and that the Church of letter time has power not only, to explain and declare, but also to coasfiiw/e those things which belong to faith. This 'ad-' iriissioh Bellarmine was compelled to, make by the incontrovertible evidence of historical facts. .He could not deny, for example, 1 hat before' the fourth Lateran Council'' (a.d.' 1215) Transubstantiation' was'hbt an article of faith. He fcoixld not deny iihat the practice of administering the Eucharist in both kinds existed in the Eatin as well as in the Greek Church down to the age of Thomas Aquinas (mid dle of the thirteenth century). He could not deny that it is declared, in the Canon Law, " that many things were allowed before the Gospel became clear which are now forbidden by the Church. — eg., the marri.age of the clergy. "We shall not, stop to notice at.lerigth thei remarkable application of this doc, trine of a gradual development of the ar ticles of faith which was made by ' the ' famous Jesuit Petavius, about the middle, of the, seventeenth century,, and which called forth the great work of the Eng-: lish Protestant bishop Bull, " Defensio Eidei ''ISicenm," for which he received, through Bossuet, the thanks of the Eo- man Catholic Clergy of Erance. Suffice it;, to . say, that Petavius asserted that the bishops and Eathers of the Church, prior to the Nicene Council, were nearly all of the same sentiments as those for which Arius was condemned! and, con sequently, that the true faith y/as noijullg held in the Church from the heginning, but was only gradually arrived at and developed. The infidel historian. Gibbon, gladly seized ou this admission of so renowned a \v:riter as Petavius, and very naturally concluded that he was an Arian, and that that' the object of his elaborate work was to overthrpw the Nicene faith; but; as Dr. Newman , well points out,, Petavius's rea,l. object was very different, and one much more in keeping, with the principles of the order to which lie be longed. ' In bur next number we! shall proceed to giyo: a sketch of the, more recent history of this development ' theory. Meanwhile, we request our Ebman' Catholic readers to bear in mind' that tte '! Church,' which ; they ' regard .as ' in fallible, and, immutable is , at, variance! with herself upon the most' impor-' taht question- iir theology — a' iquestidu' wliich underlies hll. others, 'and which; in fact,, aiiects the very foundation of the!' Christian : religion — the Eule of Eaithi The ; Council, bf Trent, with a' host of divines,'" asserts' that it is 'fixed and uu- chaugeablb— the same from the beginning, now, and' forever. The modern .Cliurch ofEome, as represented by her choicest , and most renowned champions, holds, on the other hand, that articles of faith , are ' independeut of antiquity, arid may be called into existence at any tiine that the., existing Church sees fit to do. so.

A Catliolic L>eas;iie. — A corres- pendent of the ChurcH Review suggests the. formation of a " Catholic League," and the Editor states that be will do bis utmost towards founding it.

' ' Jesuit njoctriue.- Tilo R..e. Tablet recently declared that " the doctrines of the' Jesuits are" the "doctrines of all the clergy,; arid their cause the: cause of the Church." At' a'tiino when assassihationa are' so. frequent in ; Ireland, Mt may bo useful to know what the Jesuit' doctrine as to killing tyrants is, as ex-i ponndcd by the i well-known ; Jesuit 'writer, ; Johri'Mariana, thus : — The life: of ai tyrant is evidently wretched which is:held upon the tenure, that he who should kill him would he highly esteemed both in'fnyoiir and in praise.; It is a' glorious thing to cxtermihate this pesli- lent'dnd mischievous race' fr6m< the communitg of men " (" Do Rege et Regis Institutiono,'' Lib.

Mr. Belling- ham in a 'letter to theidaily papers urges that it'would have saved the country. Biit one' thing is certain — witlu the play it has had, it worked nothing but mischief. According to ri return just 'made, every suspect confined in gaol in Ireland on a charge of outrage is a Romanist. There is not oven one case of a Protestant being in prison on that account. This is significant. The ipapists may he well! meaning people, morally speaking, but thej' furnish the . whole of Irish agrarian, crime at nnyfato; ' . ! :
