V.R.C. Autumn Meeting. [By Telegraph.] [From our Special Correspondent.] Melbourne, March 12. Fine weather again favored the third and last day of this important meeting, and it is satisfactory to record that the concluding operations were highly successful in every particular. There was a marked improve ment in the attendance, which included the Governor and the Marchioness of jSormanby and suite. The-character of the sport -was well maintained at the end of the feathering, the day% proceeding* befog introduced by the second Kursery Handicap, which was illustrative «f ike victory of a rank eat aider to Cbbstoun, bred and owned by Mr. A. K. Finlay, of Glenormiston. The board thowad thirty-seven starters for the Kewmarket Handicap, the absentees being- Ceurtenay, Guild, Waterloo, Santa Claus, Trevallyn, Lohengrin, and Cassiopeia. It ia the largest field ever known for this event, and as nwl Ma wwtt—tfawlwned hgavysaeoa- Ution prior to the fall of the flag. Thelarge amoubi «f money forthooming from New Booth Wales was instrumental in causing Hesperian to displace the Ghost for the favoriuhip, while the respective advances of Larpent and Hyacinth were so highly fancied in nnmerons well-informed quarters that both were also accorded liberal support. Of the remainder Surrey, Sweet William, Besolt, Josephine, Sir Joseph, and Tyropean wete in most favor at out side prices, ranging from 18 to 40 to 1 each. It was a desperate race from the jump, Hesperian having slightly the best of the position for fully half tEedisUnoe, when Surrey, The Ghost. Larpent. Result, Euclid, Somerset, Cremorne, and Gamecock all appeared to possess winning chances. Hes perian shirked it immediately Pigott touched him with the whip, and then the issue looked like resting between Result, Hyacinth. The Ghost, Gremorne, andJSuclid,and?esntt?nd Cremorne ware the first to give way among this lot; whereupon The Ghost subsided; and the race was reduced to a match between Hyacinth and Euclid, the former eventually living the longer under severe punishment, whilst Larpent who came wonderfully fast at the finish, was placed third, though the majority of people were of opinion that he was entitled to second place. He finished right under the judge's box—a circumstance which for the difference of opinion which prevailed on the Bubject; awl ao close did some of the on looker* view the finish between Hyacinth and Larpent taat considerable doubt was mani fested prior to the official fiat. The Ghost ran a good bone for five furlonga, bat he failed to eorroboeate the wonderful things pel-fanned by feist ia private. Perhaps the greatest surprise of the whole race was the fact that Euclid should have finished before his stable companion, the Ghost. The latter always beat him in their trials, and in consequence Euclid was not trusted by the stable. Joe Morrison's party won largely by Hyacinth's victory. Mr. Pearson, the owner, alone netting £7,OJJ. Pollio and Hyacinth were backed in numerous doubles at a thousand pounds to a sovereign, and the ring lose heavily. Although Mr. Phillips declared to win the Town Plate with Pell Bell and accepted 000 to 400 in one bet, this fact did not prevent Commotion from instantly going to the front and remaining there from start to finish, much to the disgust of those who had pinned their faith to the official deeUratiotu The defeat of Solitude in the All-Aged Stakes was equally inexplicable to those who mid 3 *? l on tar on 4he strength of her previous form. Twilight experienced no difficulty in repeating her last autumn victory in the Steeple, and the Duchess at hut save ber Four sears Old Handicap. SSJCOSD MRSEUV lUXDIC.tr.

Wilson dispatched the thirty-seven competitors at the first time of asking, the first to appear to any prominence being Mulatto in the centre of the course, Somerset, Bathurst,GufliUi, Larpent, tiliost, and Result presenting a leading line across the whole breath of the coarse. After going a couple of hundred yards Result, next the inside of the rails, held a clever lead of everything, Surrey, Mulatto, Somerset, Bathurst, Timon, and Gamecock, with Con stellation, holding an advanced position aluadof the rest. When half the distance had been traversed Result still had three-quarters of a length advantage over Hyacinth and Surrey, with Hes perian, Somerset, Larpent, Euclid, and Gamecock holding conspicuous positions in advance of the remainder of the field, all of whom were in di*tre«. When well within the distance Result gave way to Hyacinth, wLo was closely hampered with Surrey, Game o.-ck and Tumult; the test baring died a* ay. The leaden were now at the whip, a&d; one of the most exciting races ensued fur the test of the journey, Hyacinth responding gamely to the repeated caUs of Graham, who finally landed him a dorter winner by a nock in advance of Euclid, who finished a head before Larpent, who came very fast at the finish under the judge* box. Surrey was fourth, and the Ghost fifth, the rest follow ing in a chaster. Tune, I mm. IC, sees. town rum:. A swerrstakes "( 10 «>*«- each, h. ft., with 500 added. Fortune;ear oMsiailnpwanLi.
