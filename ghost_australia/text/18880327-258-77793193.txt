Rule, which rational men can accept,. then "Separation may remaihdead and] buried for many years. That these ' must he a new " deal," a _^aew] paiiation of Northern Australia,] is evident to anyone who knows the country. The game MACB6SSAK fe i now playing in the North is veiy plain. Under-sover of Separation and a what you can" policy he will try to 3 induce the Northern constituencies to j elect men, outwardly pledged to Separa- ] , tion, but in reality pledged to support . [ MC&WBAITH.; When thestragglecbmes ] ' on in the House, aiid a rote -of no- , confidence is proposed by MCII/WBAETH against the GRIFFITH Ministry, then the Northern MACROSSAN contingent | will be paraded, and who can doobt how they will vote. Supposing all the j Northern MCILWBAITH " sheep in wolves clothing" in the last Parlia ment are returned again, will they not vote straight for MCIIAYRAITH ? BLACK, ? CHUBB, MACROSSAN, PHILP, ? TJTSRWBR, j B&iOLn;)s,\PAiiHEs! They would, tone j and all, vote for kicking out GRIFFITH. 1 The question has left all principles behind; it is now a personal matter.. (xEiidm is" in the opinion of the MCILWRAITU party a rogue, and mnst let another rogue have his> innings. All the rogues in the colony throw up their hats and say "that is only fair and square, let us all have a turn at the plunder." W e are not over-stating 1 the question a bit. MeltWRAITH'S pro j gramme cannot be entertained by any Northern electorate, and as for his political honesty, not even his own party believe in it. GRIFFITH'S mani- j fesfco covers all the -leading questions of the day; he glances at some, and in this reticence his enemies see signs of treachery. But it most be remembered that the leader of a great carty has to conciliate all its sections,-to; com promise on some points, so as to secure the willing support of those who5 believe 4lj#ertam things. DICKSON and PATJSRSGN seceded from GRIFFITH, be cause tlieycould not follow him in all his proposals; he may modify them in order to secure their al legiance. Tf they .can support Mm, they wdU. vote -on his side rather than let in the Melt WRAITH buccaneers. That is the position of the Northern Liberals . if" a ?vote -of no-confidence were proposed; by MCILWRAITH in the GRIFFITH MidSehy, all the Northern -men abovemeidaoned \--MACBGSSAS, PHILP, BLACK, LISSNER,' CHUBB. PALMER-would-- vote solid, against G RIFFITH. The Liberal mem bras, who will be returned for Croydon and Charters Towers, though "they, may be opposed to the ifa vkl Xfefence Bill, will vote against the no-confidence m<$3.pn; not so much to keep ^GfiQfUH in, as to"Tceep i McliwaA|TH out. For. to be tbe leaderof an Australian and ] 'democratic -party; he. promises wdj,J and in the union between Capital anil,; Labor he could not promise better; bnt there is a long way between promise j and performance, and his decentralisa- S tionBilIs of last session do sot tend to 1 inspire any great confidence in his pro- j fessions. There is 110 better leader of the iLiberal party available, and it mnst utilise -him as far as ho will go^ ^ if he will not expand, then he will " burst," and a true leader of the Queensland Democracy will lie found. The .danger" to democracy in Charters Towers is that some windy claptrap, some Cheap Jack, some brazen and empty - demagogne may. Jay and delude the electors into choosing hini. We certainly should prefer to see RCTLEDGE returned before SELBT for Charters Towers.# ^Ee has not been, it is true, of mnch use to the electors; ? but he is, at "least, on the right side, and if he can sink MR Naval Defence Bill he shonld be preferred to any windy mouthpiece, or travelling mountibank for shillings. If the elec tors cannot find an educated, indepen dent and local candidate to represent the principles of democracy, jof land' naturalisation and of sound progress, then they mnst do the next best thing support HODGKTISBOX as a preference, or as apis aUer-BUTLEDGE though a lawyer and no local roan The peculi arity about this electorate is, that therej appears to be a plethora of^jiandidates, and all on one side. Now, ^ihis is" dangerous and embarrassing. There are some candidates who have not the ghost of a chance; yet they intend to stand to spoil another's chance. This is . a new kind.of democracy. ? The NORTHERX MIKES platform is wide enough to cover all reasonable aspira tion^. The personal animosity ex-J hibited towards the editor of that journal is unworthy of true demoerate. As for the spurious democracy drawling, about here under the patronage,# and: in the pay of the M'ILWRAHH party, it can only recoil on the men wholend themselves to such low and base means to destroy the G RIFFITH party.. Tnfe! tools which the M'ILWEAITH party )toe are using are dirty enough, in all con science. Wethink the apparentlyre . fipectable men connected with this LM?ILWKA.ITH; dnnekin organ should': dis avow-th^ connection. We like Sail ihg^under open colors. 3Jo English ensign to be replaced by the Black Flap. No treachery of that kuylwili be" tolerated by the electors oT Towers. Let ns have fair fighting awn" Lno foal blows. . - J ? ;
