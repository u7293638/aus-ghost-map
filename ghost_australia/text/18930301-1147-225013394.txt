MOBE IBSENISM. The production of Ibsen's " Master Builder " at the Trafalgar Square Theatre, on Monday, has re-awakened interest in the Norwegian dramatist, whom Mr, William Archer, first intro duced to English readers. Ibsen, who is nearly 63, after his university career became director of the Bergen Theatre, and subsequently started on his career as a dramatist. His earlier works were mainlv occunied with the sasras of his Norse ancestors, though in " Emperor and Galilean " he diverged into a criticism of " Julian the Apostate." In 1877, appeared " The Pillars of Society," the first presentment of Ibsen's social views, followed by the startling " Ghosts," An Enemy of the People," "The Wild Duck," " Bosmcrsholm " and " Hedda Gabler." All these latter have been translated into English, and played in this country with varying verdicts. One school of critics have acclaimed Ibsen as the keen, social surgeon, probing the hypocrisies of life with stern sarcasm, and at the same time as the reformer putting the true facts of heredity before his generation. His opponents, on the other hand, declare that his " realism " is unreal, that the darker side of life is unjustifiably magnified, while the lighter disappears, and that a distorted picture is presented. Ibsen has always been an uncomprising advocate of Norwegian independence, and the Socialists have claimed him us their own, though with not very certain grounds. Of late years he has lived princi pally in Muuich. His wife is a step-daughter of the Norwegian poetess, Magdalena Thomson. The " Master Builder " deals less closely with social problems than some of his other plays1 IBSEN. It is impregnated with a symbolism which the Ibsenites are busy trying to interpret, with somewhat diverse results.
