After the races at Caulfield on Saturday, when the course was cleared, Hippoirritt* and Blink Bonny were sent the (Jup distance, presumedly at their respective weights,(but whatever they might have carried, the mare finished a long1 way the best. The heavy raiua which fell on Saturday and Snnday ! made the tracks at Flemiugton so sloppy that anything j but slow work was impossible this morning. The new j track was the most used, on which Tom Brown in j clothing did a good sweating, Signor following suit. Yeoman's gave Student;:^ couple .pf.m^Ies on the cinder, the last live furlongs of which were done as-fust as the lad would let him go. Noue of the Hon. J. White's horses were out except at walking paces, Mr Pennelly preferring to wait until things wore a safer uud more promising aspect. ' Mr. F.F. Dakin had his lot out with the exception of Commotion, who after his gallop of. the other morning .showed his oldsyniptonis of lameness,'andibeing con sidered uufit to run was scratched accordingly. The New Zealanders, Wiuchester, Oudeis, Liverpool, and Thunderbolt were out, but as Vanguard was an absentee, it may be assumed that his chances of coming to the pose are remote. . The protest lodged against Mentmore, on the ground that his, jockey Jostled iuthe Toorak Handicap, at Caulfield; oil Saturday last, W03 dismissed;' ' There wasalarge crowd of bookmakers and others at Bowe's Tattersalls during the day, the principal busi ness in hand being the settling over the Caulfield races. For the Maribyrnoiii? Plate,,Acme's victory iuthe Foal Stakes caused her to be first favorite; but there were no layers beyond that G to 1 was otfered on the field. For the Derby-Nordenfelt stood at 4 to I (oil); First Chester, G to 1 (off); Isonoiny, 8 to 1 (off). Thunderbolt was backed for all the money obtainable at 10 to 1, after . which 8 to 1 was taken. For the Caulfield Cup-Velocipede was backed to win £5,000, at 100 to 8. Gratitude found favor at 100 to taken and wanted. At 25 to 1, "Winchester was backed . to wiu £2,000 at one pop, and offers were made for more at the same price..; .

Our Melbourne correspondent, writiug yesterday, says:-The news of the scratching of Commotion for the Melbourne Cup was received with much regret to .day, as the old horse .had beeu backed far and wide to win the Melbourne Cup, for which his chance, notwith standing his heavy weight, was considered second to none. The old horse has so oft-en proved that he wou't be crushed out of a race that the i.ublie were fully justified in entrusting him with their monev, and knowing as they did that they would have a good ma for it. The scratching of Commotion, New-jtead, and Corouet, and the death of Eeleue, all mean lot# of money iu the pockets of bookmakers before even the races begin.
