LITERARY LINES. Mudgee Taylor will be remembered as the I eccentric but talented New South Welshman | who went third-class to England, and there j appeared as his own counsel before the Privy Council, and astonished the legal world by his lay brilliancy. He is a literate ur, and was j once handed " More Leaves from our Life in | the Highlands " to review. He got through a | few pages of the drivel with the aid of a little i stimulant, but all the best liquor in the world could not brace him up against the puerile chronicles of what the ghillie John Brown did, so he threw the precious volume 011 the floor. and kicked it around the room to relieve his feelings. Then he bundled the trash back to the ofhce and declined the contract. Mr. C. T. Clarke (a brother to Mr. M. J. Clarke, the bookseller, of Rundle- street) has contributed a reply in the Centennial Magazine to the articles previously pub lished therein by Mr. G. % B. Barton on Australian authorship. Mr. Clarke, while sympathizing with the authors, defends the publishers, and points out the regrettable fact that Australian readers despise Australian books. He says, however :—" It is probable that before many years are over, when the first or second generation of born Australians have reached that period of life at which they can grant themselves leisure and recreation, they will then seek that which is Australian in literature simply because it is Australian." Phil. May, known throughout Australia for his clever caricatures in the Sydney Bulletin, has left Rome, where he went to study painting, and has accepted an engagement on a London comic paper. An Australian squatter made a standing offer of <£1,000 for the first picture May exhibited at one of the Academies. Andrew Anderson, a Norwood Scotchman, who writes jingle, has got an impression into his capacious brain that David Christie Murray has written about him. That thought is like a ghost in an untenanted house, and Andrew is in tribulation.
