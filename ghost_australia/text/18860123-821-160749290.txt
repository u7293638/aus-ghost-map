RACING IN VICTORIA. VICTORIAN CLUB RACES. |By Telegraph.) Melbourne. Jancarv 17. Tbe annual race meeting of the Victorian Club was held on tbe Flemington Course on Saturday afternoon. Though the programme was a good one, and the prizes well worthy of the contests, the attendance on the ground was very scanty. Racing commenced with tbe Hurdle Race, for which nine horses started, Insolvent being most fancied, though Royal Maid had a good many supporters. Vulcan, who was steered by Corrigan, was next in public favour, bnt the favourite daBbed to the front at the start, and held his place all the way. Vulcan was drawing up to the leaders when he fell near the abattoirs and gave Corrigan a very severe shaking, but fortunately without injuring him seriously. Roval Maid blundered at the last hurdle, and Sinking Fund just beat her for second place. The Victorian Gold Cup brought out a field of nineteen starters, Bohemian being most fancied in thiB as in the first race. It was a runaway affair, for Lavington went away with the lead on the word being given, and making every post a winning one, he gained a com fortable victory from Claptrap, who looked dangerous near the distance post, but could not get up at the finish. The Two-year-old Selling Race resulted in a fine struggle between St. Paul and Mainsail, the former gaining the victory by a bare head. The winner was put up for sale and bought by Mr. Nathan for £280, of which tbe club get £180. Only four horses started for the Selling Race, Snip was leading when they came into view and he held his position all the way home. He wbb purchased by E. Weeks for £100, all of which goes to the club. The Steeplechase brought out five starters, Lady Ashton being most fancied. In this, as in the former race, the favourite led from start to finish. Wymlet unshipped his rider near tbe training ground, and got away. Chester II. fell near the far torn, and Pheno menon fell at the last fence bnt one. Pride gained second place, bnt oonld never get near Lady Ashton. The racing concluded with the Jacuary Handicap, for which seventeen horses started.
