TEACHERS' SALARIES. To the Editor of the Ueelong Advertiser. teachers in Geelouf who have not yet received their salaries for the quarter ending the 1st of December last'/ Yet such is the fact, and a most humiliating fact it is, for the instruction of our youth to be taunted by the'ghost of debt is one of the most degrading iufltienccs that can be placed upon him, it is well well known that he is any thing but well paidandyet'small though his salary is he iB compelled to supply Ins necessities for sis months without it really it is enough to drive every respectable teacher from his profession I will guarantee, sir, that the host of inspectorial vampires who are drawing from six to eight hun dred a year each from the educational grant havo not been six moutlis without their sinidl (!) salaries. Oh! no, they were paid regularly at the appointed time.But' poor country teachers receiving salaries of one hnndred and fifty, or at most, two hundred pounds, are compelled in some way or other to keep body and soul together with out their salaries for six months. It is a shame to members of a board that will permit such an outrage upon common honesty. The national board pays its teachers monthly, this is also the rule'in other government depart ments, I wonld like to know theu why tho De nominational Board should not also pay in the same way ? The Board pirofesses to pay once a quarter jj| the evil is that even that rule is seldom punctually carried out Yours, &c;, A Teacueb.
