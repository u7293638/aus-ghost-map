Benalla Challenge Cup. WON BY EUROA. On Saturday last the final competition for the Benalla Challenge Cup took place on the Euroa cricket ground, between the Corowa and the local club. The visitors arrived by the 10.10 a.m. train, three men short. Play was commenced at 11.30, Haslam and Beard playing as substitutes for Corowa, who took the field, Pleasants and McCormick facing the bowling of H. Bayliss, the former secur- ing a single off the last ball of the first over. Ford bowled from the other end, and delivered a maiden, his bowling being too dangerous to take liberties with. Mac. snicked Bayliss prettily for 2, put- ting the wood on for 4 immediately afterwards. A few singles at long inter- vals, and then Buggy went on in place of Bayless, his slows securing the dismissal of McCormick, who tried to play back at a "soft one"—1-7-9. Turner filled the vacant crease, and after a brace off Buggy's second ball, lifted the next one beautifully for 5. Ford then bowled another maiden over. In Buggy's next, several singles were run. Turner skied one, into the hands of Sinclair, at long- field, but the ball was dropped, a single being scored. Another maiden was sent down by Ford. Bayliss then took charge of the ball, Turner making a false hit at his first ball, and was taken at point by Reade.—2-10-24. Weir filled the vacant crease, Pleasents putting Bayliss away for a brace immediately afterwards, and ditto for a single. The play at this stage was very careful, nothing but an occasional single being obtained. Buggy then took the ball, and runs came off his first over. The "soft ones" tempted Weir, who in trying a big hit repeated Turner's per- formance, being caght by the same man, 3-8-39. Barr was the next player, and placed his second ball over the fence for 4—40 up, after three-quarters of an hour's play. Ford then put in his fourth maiden. Pleasents lifted Buggy for 4, following by a single 50 up. Barr's time then arrived, Ford catching and bowling. 4-7-54. W. Emmett joined the Euroa skipper, who was playing sterling cricket, but Ford's first ball proved fatal to the new comer, who was clean bowled. 5-0-56. P. McLean followed, and scored a single off Ford, three others bringing 60 up. Pleasents then got the leather away for 4, following with a single and a brace. Buggy then relieved Bayliss, and runs came freely—70 up. McLean then put one to Buggy, who held it.—6-5-76. C. Williams filled the vacancy, and scored several singles, the fielding and bowling of Corowa being very good. Ford and Bayliss keeping the the batsmen alive—80 up, the former having 7 maidens to his credit. Slowly, 90 came up, maiden after maiden being bowled, 7 overs being pro- ductive of but 5 runs. The century came up after a quarter of an hour's play, amidst cheers. Pleasents signalised the three figures by putting one to the fence, Williams doing the same for 4—110. Four to Pleasents, and then Ford bowled Wil- liams with a beauty.—7-16-111. The retiring batsman was at the wickets over half an hour. E. Emmett took the bat, Pleasents cementing the partnership with a fine drive for 4. Emmett's reign was short, being caught off the first ball by Buggy.—8-0-118. Sinclair the next bats- man, met the same fate—9-0-118. The last batsman, Birkett, was almost run out in trying to steal a short run, and after a few overs was run out.—10-0-123. Pleasents kept his wicket up throughout the innings, and received a well-deserved ovation, his score of 70, not out, being made in first-class style, without giving the fieldsmen the ghost of a chance. After an hour's interval for lucnh, the Euroa team took the field. Messrs A. and E. Bayliss appeared at the wickets for Corowa, P. McLean and Weir bowled. After a few overs, E. Bayliss was caught by Birkett off McLean.—1-3-4. Buggy took the bat, and made some peculiar hits, driving the ball through his legs behind the wicket, but the fieldsmen pre- vented runs. After a protracted interval, Buggy sent one to the fence for two, E. Emmett cleverly saving the 4. A. Bayliss making two good hits for 4 shortly, after- wards, 30 up. A quarter of an hour's stone-walling and Bayliss was clean bowled by Weir.—2-13-39. Ford, the captain; was the next comer, and played one to his wicket.—3-0-43. A. E. Bayliss followed, and after some steady play, Buggy was bowled by McLean, after having played an admirable innings.— 4-20-15. Reade followed, and played a ball on, without scoring.—5-0-45. H. Bayliss was the next man, and was caught by Pleasents.—6-1-50. The next man, Carns, made a hard hit to the fence, and after being once let off, was well taken by Pleasents.—7-6-61. Beard (substitute) took the crease, and opened with a good drive, A. E. Bayliss meanwhile playing good cricket, and gradually increasing his score till he was unfortunately run out.— 8-12-65. Haslam, one of the Euroa men, playing substitute, filled the vacancy, and opened with a drive for 4, after which Beard was thrown out, the final figures appearing—9-1-70. Just as the last wicket fell, a tremendous storm of rain and hail passed over the ground, com- pletely precluding all further play. The match was therefore decided in favor of Euroa on the first innings. The fielding on both sides was very good, and the same may be said with reference to the bowling. The batting, however, was decidedly faulty, as a glance at the scor- ing will show. Buggy and the brothers Bayliss did very well for Corowa, as did Pleasents and Williams for Euroa. The rest of the team showed a fatal desire to force the scoring, and fell victims to their precipitancy. The following are the scores :— EUROA.
