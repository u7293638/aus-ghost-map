I r AMUSEMENTS. A ? "Queen Elizabeth" was repeated at the Theatre Royal last night to a large audience, and Miss Dargon was recalled at the close of every scene As her season approaches its close the attendance seems to swell, and if continued " Queen Elizabeth" would probably prove as successful as " Queen Mary " To- night, however, it will be played for the last time, and to-morrow night Miss Dargon will im- personate Judy O' Trot in " Ireland, As it is " This abrupt transition from high tragedy to fa -clean comedy proves the lady's versatility, and Judy O'! rot is said to be one of her best characters Theatre goers will be glad to learn that Mr Lazar has been able to induce Miss Dargon to prolong her engagement for six more nights during which a round of her best characters will be played A further prolongation of the season is impossible, owing to previous arrangements At the Victoria Theatre "Alone wanathe"Deerslajer" were repeated Mr Darrell now plays Colonel Chalice with better effect than on its first presentation, and the most intricate workings of the mind of the blind man were laid bare to the audience Miss Watt-Tanner and Miss Mayor supported him well, and this, as well as the succeeding drama, was well received The attendance at the School of Arts was unusually small The programme comprised ' Baby," and some excellent ventriloquial performances by Mr "V al Vose This evening the Kelly and Leon Company will bring to a close what appears to have been a most brilliant season.

The programme was carried out in the usual finished manner, and the applause was as wide and flattering as ever Burton's Circus was only moderately attended last night.
