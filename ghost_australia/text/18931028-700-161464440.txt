School of Arts CoaJfiPR55 The concert on Tuesday night, in aid of the School of Arts funds, passed off very successfully. The hall was well filled, ami the programme was as excellent as varied, and was thoroughly appreciated. The minstrelsy introduced by Mr. T. Rogerson was something novel here, and that clever negro delineator quite took the house by storm, and at once established himself a favorite. His rendition of ' Old Black Joe,' in character, was quite up to the standard of the best professionals in metro politan halls, while in song and dance, comicalities, and witticisms he has very few equals anywhere. He was a decided acqui sition at Tuesday's concert, and will be a great help at future entertainments in this town and district; Mr. E. S. Hall opened the programme with an impromptu over ture, and did similar duty in the second par*., as well as singing the comic song, ' The Lost Cliild,' and playing several of 1)11(3 flAyUUUJIJnbJli.Ui.dlUO. -1.11 TO.bVLi lji.nt;uilivc; JLlij did himself justice as a ilrst-class pianist, while his vocal effort was highly appreci ated. Mr. J. Rainsford sang ' My old wife and I,' his get-up being good, and the song acceptable to the audience. Miss M. Browne sang 'Daddy' in a pleasiug man ner, and with her sister gave the duet, ' Music and her sister, Song,' with much acceptance. Mr. J. L. Lee recited, from Shakespeare, ' Henry before. Hnrfleur,' aud sang ' Let me like a soldier fall,' his efforts being applauded. Mrs. Johnson sweetly sang ' Beauty Sleep,' and with Miss .Bryce gave one of the best numbers of- the even ing, 'Life's dream is o'er.' Miss Bryce possesses a rich, powerful contralto voice. MissL. Hbbbs rendered valuable assistance; she sang ' Whisper aud I shall hear,' very pleasingly; and with -Mrs: Peterkin ren dered the duet, ' The Wind and the Harp' (both being heard to advantage) ; and in the 'Laughing Trio;' she sustained the leading part, that of the gipsy queen, with great credit. Mr. W. Hobbs, besides sing ing 'The Village Blacksmith,' ably took his pai t in the gipsy trio, Mr. B. Seccombe assisting in the latter item. Miss Aarons' song, ' Only once more,' was well received, as also was Miss Ryan's ' Priuia Donna.' The latter lady was in fine voice, and if not a priina donna herself, certainly kept up her reputation as the leading vocalist here. Mr. Rogerson and Mr. Peterkin gave the character sketch, 'Old Black Joe,' as a finale to the first part of the programme, the former taking the title role and the latter representing Master Charles. Mr. Rogerson was in great form, and his portrayal of the aged nigger was simply splendid. In response ; to a vociferous encore, he gave ' Darling Little Nell' (song and dance), and to satisfy the demands of the audience re-appeared a third time, and gave a stump speech. Later on he sang also sustained the leading part in the farce, 'The Ghost in the Pawnshop/' being ably assisted by Messrs. W. #Aley and A. E. Browne. The farce abounds with ridicu lous situations, and mirth-provoking epi sodes, the audience being fairly convulsed throughout. ; Just before, the close of !thei entertainment^ Messrs. Bryce and Eeterkin, on behalf of the Schooliof Arts committee, proposed a vote of thanks to the ladies and gentlemen who had ,4kincJ|y jigiyen their as-: 'instance to help the funds of the institution.
