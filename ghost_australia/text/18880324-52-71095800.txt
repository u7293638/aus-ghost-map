A Bushranger Frightened. (See cartoon on page G23.) Instances are not wanting to Bhow that even tho most reckless men aro subject'to panic when taken by surprise. If we may judge from the accounts whicu have come down to our times, the knights of old, whose bravery and ohivalry formed the themes of so many songs, were a curious mix- turo of bravery and cowardice. Their bravery waB physical j while their cowardice was mental ; for they wore, as a rule, terribly superstitious, and, unlike the modern spiritualists, instead of running after ghosts, they would run away from them a3 hard as they could. Even Brian de Bois Gilbert, the Admirable Criohton, or Bayard him- self, would have bolted at once if a hint had'been given that they had to meet something super- natural. This hoing the case, it is not inuoh to be wondered at if knights of the road, or, as thoy aro called in Australia, bushrangers, should draw tho line at facing anything they might consider uncanny. Consequently, it was not surprising that tho bushranger, when sticking up tho Banjoo wanjie mail, was frightened by tho ear trumpot suddouly thrust from the coaoh by Mr. Swash- buckler, as shown in our cartoon, and should drop his pistol, and refuse to tackle suoh au unearthly looking weapoa as thatr - . ?.?
