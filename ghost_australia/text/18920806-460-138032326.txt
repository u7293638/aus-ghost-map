ORIGINAL POETRY. GRANNY. Sing to me, childie darling. Or some soft music play ; I dream by the window, darling, Facing the dying day. Granny has grown so weary, The tired old eyes are dim ; Shadows creep in from the garden, But sunbeams thro' them swim. Sing: to me, childie darling, In vague, sweet minor lays ; I drift away on the music, To the world of other days; And stealing into my mem'ry, And lilting into my brain, Come the thoughts I had deemed forgotten And the ghost of a deadening pain. The deep full hours of the sunset Solemnly, slowly pass ; I can hear the chirping of crickets Muffled in moist'ning grass; The sough of leaves in the lightwoods Out in the dark'ning space ; O, shadow, come in from the garden, And lie on my tired old face! Sing to me, childie darling, Granny is worn and grey ; My life is low as the shining That ebbs from the stricken day. My wrinkled hands are folded, And closed are my faded eyes; Sing to me, child beloved, While the stars grow thro' the skies." Childie, childie ! singing In deep, soft dusky hours: The dews slip into the lilies, Drawing the scent from the flowers. Music, mysterious, tender, Filling the peaceful place O, shadow come in from the garden, And lie on the tired old face. JENNINGS CARMICHAEL
