THE CHIVALRY OF OnOSTS. Once on a time there was a churchyard in the West ern Highlands of Scotland notorious for being haunted. A ' wee wicked tailor,' for a trifling wager, under took to sit alone, at midnight, on a tomb within the church, and sew a pair of truish. As fie was busy at work, by the light of his horn lanthorn he saw a mouldy skull rise from a neighbouring sarcophagus, followed by arms, spine, and legs, which gradually ' gathered to a whole.' ' Tailor,' cried the phantom, 'do you see these grey mouldy shanks r' ' They're grey enough,' replied the tailor, who had just com pleted his task, ' and mouldy enough, and I dare say cold enough, so there's a pair of truish to cover them.' And therewithal he flung the vestment to the spectre, and began to run. The ghost, being a Highlandman, was resolute to lose nothing, so it caught the trousers and attempted to pull them on while running after the tailor. Its legs getting entangled it came little speed ; and seeing this, hundreds of sympathetic gob lins started from their respective graves. In short, the 'hue and cry' had gone through the spectral regions, and the 'posse comitatus' of ghostdom was up in pursuit of the tailor. In the agony of his fear, while dodging round one skeleton that was sticking on its leg, and ducking beneath the uplifted 'arm of another not yet freely playing in its socket, the ninth part of humanity yelled outâ€” 'In God's name, gen tlemen, one at a time J' And such is the chivalry of ehosts that the solemn appeal was complied with.
