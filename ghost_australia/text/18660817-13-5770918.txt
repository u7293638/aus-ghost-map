BALLARAT. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THURSDAY, AUG. 16. The share market was tolerably lively to-day again, and a brisk demand set in in the morning for Koh-i-noor, Newington, Red Jacket, Ballarat Freehold, and Western Freehold, All of these, except the Red Jacket, receded again towards closing time. The fluctuation in the Newington was extraordinary and few if any are able to account for it. They opened at £22, lose to £28, and fell again to £21 10s. Koh-i-noor opened at about £88, rose to £40, and fell gradually to £38 and £37 10s. Ballarat Freehold started at £4, went up to £4 17s. 6d" and left off at £4 10s. Western Freehold opened at 22s. 6d., rose to 25s., and left off at £2 10s. Red Jacket were in good and steady demand at £10 29. 61, £10 4s. 6d, £10 5s., and £10 7s. 6d. Warrior receded a good deal during the day, sales being quoted at £3 10s., '£3 15s" £3 10s" £3 5s., £3, and £2 10s. Sir William Don also fell in value considerably, having dropped to £110. Band of Hope fell to £120, £118, and £117. Freebooter sold at £1 2s. and £1 3d. The following sales are also reported Contest Freehold, 7s. 6d. Charlton, £1 55" £1 it.; Cape Clear, £10; Miners' Racecourse, iös.; Duke of Cornwall, Majorca, £1 1s. and £1 2s. and Ballarat Extension, £9 5s., £9 7s. 6d. The quarterly report of the Lalla Rookh Company shows the receipts to have been £3, 19 for that period, and the expenditure £2,742. Their overdraft is £939. The directors of the North British Company have decided on purchasing and erecting machinery as soon as possible. The Central Freehold Company have got their shaft cleaned out to a depth of 197 feet, and have found it in good repair. The Miners' Racecourse Company have repaired the damages recently so wantonly inflicted upon them, and have resumed sinking their shaft. The plant of the Golden Rivers Company was sold to-day for £950. It would appear from two paragraphs In the Star to-day that, unless measures of a most severe kind are adopted to prevent a recurrence of the mining outrages that have recently occurred, we may expect a state of anarchy almost frightful to contemplate. On the authority named, it seems that the Miners' Racecourse Company have set on their men again to resume sink- ing their shaft, and that to protect themselves these men are " armed." Nothing can be more significant of the danger that is threatened than this. K men who tender for the sinking of the shaft of a gold-mining company are to be driven into defending them selves and their labour by force of arms, a ead prospect is opened up to us. The case against Forbes, manager of the Band of Hope Company, which it was reported would be brought before the Bench to-day, does not come off until Saturday. Mr. Rolfe met a few of the electors of the South-Western Province last night, at the Buck's Head Hotel when committee was formed to further his election. The proceedings appear to have been cold and tame. Warrenheip has a ghost story to send to the local papers some imp, or better spirit, who lights candles after they are blown out, and makes the candlesticks hop about like grasshoppers. A friend of mine blew a candle out in the haunted room to-day, but wisely kept watch through a chink in the slabs. At the expiration of the half hour he entered, and found the candle unlighted as he left it. The " ould 'woman" of the house assured him he had missed the chance of seeing the miracle from his want of faith.
