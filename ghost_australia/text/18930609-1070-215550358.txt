WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you've loft undone, . Which gives you a bit of heartache At the setting of the sun. Tbe tender word Forgotten, Too letter you did not write. The flowers yon might hare sent, dear. Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way. The bit of btarlsotse counsel You wero hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, Tbe gentle and winsome tone - xTb&t; you bad no time or thonght for With troubles enough of your own. The little act cf kindness, ' j ' So easily out of mind, - - " Those chances to be angels Which every mortal finds— Thoy come in night and silence- Each chill, reproachful wroth — When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has droppsd on faith. Tor life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's nob the thing yon do, dear. It's the thing yon leavo undone. Which gives the bit of heartache At tho setting of tho sun.
