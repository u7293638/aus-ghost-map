RIVERSTONE. (From our own correspondent.) I A new publican has come to River-1 stone. j ¡ Mr. Loreer is erecting à house near McDonnell's poultry-yard. Our town is rapidly extending in this direction. tit. Darling ha« quito lately lost the «ervíceB of Messrs. Green and Tait. Mr. Tait is accepting the offer of a good en- gagement at Bathurst If steps are not soon taken to remove the stagnant water in front of the Police Station, very serions results to health are most likely to follow. We heat that Mr. Grigor has moved in the matter. The hearing of the claim made by the Military C. C. against the Richmonds, on Tuesday night at Windsor, caused some interest here. We hare concluded from the result, that cricket rules are not very hard and fast. The number of sheep slaughtered night- ly at the local works is gradually increas- ing: 1,600 were killed on Wednesday night. For some time previous the num- ber was about 1,000. It is anticipated that there will be a further increase to 2,000 shortly. The concluding day of the cricket match, Riverstone v. College, proved quite an exciting one. AB the weather was unpromising, only seven Riverstone men put in an appearance; These gal- lantly stuck to their guns and succeeded in winning the match by 19 runs. A ghost story in connection with a certain tent near the Meat Works has been causing much excitement, especially amongst the youngsters. Uncanny voices and mysterious removals of vari- ous articles are amongst the manifesta- tions. The owner is reported to be about to dig up the floor to discover the re- mains of the disturbed spirit.
