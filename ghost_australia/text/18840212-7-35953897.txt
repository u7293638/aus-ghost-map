THE JANUARY MAGAZINES. In The Contemporary the first place is given to Lord Carnarvon's kindly and sensible paper on "Annexation and Confederation in Australasia," Discussing briefly the seven resolutions of the Sydney Ooatomioe of the 6th December, be speaks of tte first resold tlon as an assertion of the famous American Mouoe doctrine for the BoaHi Fadfia "Teute Veiite," lie diplomatically says, "nest pas bonne a din;" bat ho admits that Uie Home Government may understand and accept the doctrine in a general acme— parUcnlatly as resolution 2 expresses the belief of the cmference that the Imperial Government will adopt the wiatrt and meet effectual measures to this end. In regard to the third resolution praying for tte immediate incorporation into the Empire of all of Few Guinea which is not Dutch. Lord Carnarvon thlnfca the object aught be BMt by protecting the industrial and trade ot Torres Straits in the aame ataanar aw the Queen's Goremment exercises a control ovar the long lino of ataboard on the Gold Coast of Africa. And while doubting as to the policy of directly asking France tototirafroai theFewHefaridesasre(olatton4 wooldappaar to contemplate. Lord Carnarvon admits that withtfaeccneuirenoeofFranMtheneu*nUia< tion of these islands might bo second, Ho balk tte fifth restdotioo Ma free aad graceful offer on the part ot the colonies, a first step to the deter co-operation of the colonial with the mother country in theaeeeptanat of com. ?on HahilHies and apartnewhipinthe datiei and ikks of savin. Bagardlng the two last resolutions as to the French venal colonies and thsb threatened extension, LordOarnar von can only express his cotifldenoo that the Qoeeris Government have aaade auah repia. sentations to France as the gravity aad urgency of the case requite. Turning to the important question of confederation, Lord Carnarvon can point with pardonable pride to the afaaro be took in the gnat season which incorporated the Dominion of Canada in 1867. Befeiiing to the reeolotlan of the Sydney Conference in favor of a Federal Council to deal with nutters on which united action nay be desirable, and remarking that the Australasian colonies, divided by long distances of sea and land, with different climates and i nsmmilil |? tanota, an not yet in a position for tte dose onion annoatpHihed in Canada, Lord Camanon rigbtiy observes that than an different kinds of federations, and that at present the cental oontrol ana* partake rather of the naton of a snkan and clastic band than of a seven and rigid chain.
