. MACBETH. . Mr. Thomas K'enny, a clever essay- ' ist, and who . has written most ably on the subject of " Macbeth," cliaract r- ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime and terror relieved by the most mag nificent imaeinative exiDressiori," yet marked with great simplicity of general design. The date of the production of the piece is set by Fumival at 1605-6, and "we may take it for granted," says Kenny, "that it was written in the time of James the First, who ascended the throne March,, 1603, as it contains an evident allusion to that monarch in act iy.' scene i, and also a complimentaiy reference to him in an other part. The material for the play was found by Shakespeare in Holin- shed's History of Scotland, where the stoiy of Macbeth is told at page 168." The Macbeth arid Duncan are repre- I seated to have been cousins ; the first a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- ' sition, and the latter " so soft and I gentle in his nature th.nt the people wished the inclination and manners of ' the two to have been so tempered and , intGrchang.ably: shared, betwixt them that where the one had too rnuch of I clemency and the other of cruelty, the , main virtue belwfcen these two extre mities might have reigned by indiffer- i cut partition in them both. The play all along keeps close to the line of Holinshed, varying from it in scarcely ) any particular ,. except in the non appearance in the banquet scene of the ' murdered Banquo's ghost." ) Tills tragedy has been presented in . Melbourne we believe oftener than any other of Shakespeare's' works. The ) late G. v. Brooke, Charles Kean, . Charles Vincent, in their time essayed ' the part, and we have had other repre- ) sentativcs, from the ' burly McKean . Buchanan and James Anderson to the ) little diip'per J; B',' HoWe. But few artists have made their Melbourne delut in the r$le of the Thane of Caw- ) dor. Of those who have, we now call ( to mind Mr. C. W.
