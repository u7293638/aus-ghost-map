They had been beating about most of the night without hauling in -anything worth mentioning, until it was' nearly morning, and then having&alled; tdown -a blessing from the saint whom their brown illuminated sail glorified, their net had filled to overflowing. They emptied it with much rejoicing upon their-xeekrng deck, and then spread th^ir canvas to jcaj^K y#ms morning breeze for Venice. .,,.... j '-;_ j \'J- '? \- If^^dc^^&^i^^^ sib 'to' dawn, the rfirst^opaline advances of .which began to nlove the qvoc^ob -pf $tip Eastern sky;: jQ'^jl j a, handful! pf ;Bal© -stars remain ia .the heavens, v.

But it looked strangely Hke3ora§ ^ajwful vision of. the deep, The helmsman e#id nothing, but crossed himself devoutly and looked in another direction. „??:..' The opaline glow that had at first been very faint now gave place to streaks of pink and grey and red ;. it looked 'like a stormy breaking of the morning. There was an unusual shadow* too, upon -the sea, the steersman thought.

The fish, 7*ith their shining scales and bright djing eyes, had been ' stowed away, and suddenly the man at the helm, pointed a long, bony finger in the direction of the ghost-like pbje# to iyindward, i?he thfng wasrepbg .n^ed in esil^hce, Ijjb' assumed an almost iipiighf 'fji^tujle --..with- the rising of the; waves j And as .they receded, it floated backwards as a graceful swimmer might/ It did not*' in Staking this -new position j however, buffet the water as a live swim-/ ^^W^^;but''rosi6,.Mnf';f.eii yith a ghostly sJch^hjEn of motion, t^hen its head topped the waves horizontally it showed a human ^ face— distorted, white and swollen — ^with f-dark hair.

They turned their eyes to leeward. $hey made us if they would sail for the open sea. The morning hesitated at the portals of day. Diice'or twice it threatened to go back into the night. Unusual clouds began ?fco gathter about the East. A heavy -fall of rain pattered down upon the sea. The swimming figure followed the ship. They had both struck the same current, TUe sailors now saw it in a new quarter. They were -afraid. Again/they tacked. This time the prow turned towards the Lido.

The vessel hoye-to, and the adventurer having fastened his boat to the line flung out by th% Jielmsman, scrambled - -aboard. The ghost floated in companionship with the vessel's boat which dropped quietly astern. ; The Chiozzia smack now hoisted her painted sails and steered for the qhan nel by the Lido.

On went the boat and its silent witness' past the grove of acacia trees -which rise out pf its tall green grasses, 'where the first butterflies ot summer were disporting themselves for their brief hour or two of gay and radiant life; Presently the vessel's course -was changed : for the Custom House, and now she went gliding along with .no swelling motion, except such as the. wooing wind gave her. The sun was up. Tenice was alive. A little ?crowd of early workmen hadgathered round the Victor Emanuel statue. The last remnants of the decorations were being removed. The pigeons in the QranJi Square of St. Mark's' -were fluttering over their first meal of the day. The two royal standards opposite the famous church^HPere flying in the morning breeze. A cluster of gondolas were lying byj the steps in the shadow of the Lion of St. Mark's. Picturesque groups of men and women were standing .near. The gorgeous palaces were glassing themselves in the Qrand Canal with blurred effects of form and color made by the rippling water. Bp.und f the corner^ ,pf the PJ^arrp P-aiacB, wh^ere the Countess Stravinsky bad looked down from the 'window of her boudoir, however, the water was still, afl.d snowed every line of architecture, every lichen on. the ancient -walls, every bit of ooze and green slime that clung to the lower stones on the water's edge, but there -was np'tratje of the tragedy of the recent fesfcivaTany more that there was of. those others which had preceded it in bygone days. 'Nor had £he wavelets in front of the palace%nyj thing to show or to say of the magnificent reception, the gay and festal music of -which had been the di^ge -wh|eh Yengaance had prepared for the BuesJLan general who had presided overihe outrages of Czarovna.
