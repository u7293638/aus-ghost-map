THE DEWSON GHOST. ^, I (To the Editor of the Maitland Mercury.)^ I Sir,-In perusing your widely circulated journal I of the 30th of last month, I observed a letter signed "Dewson's Ghost," and referring to a battle that took place some years ago between Mr. James Dewson and myself. Now, Sir, I am quite con- vinced in my own mind that this letter did not emanate from any of the Dewson family, and as I have been given to understand that Mr. James Dewson has departed this life, if such bo the case of course it would be a very un- pleasant task for mo to write or say any- thing about the dead without this attack upon me came from a member of the Dewson family. So under those circumstances I shall decline to go into particulars about this open battle that was fought between the late James Dewson-and myself. Now, I have a very htrong suspicion who this sneaking i cur is that assails me under the fictitious name of "Dewson's Ghost," and if he has one spark of man- liness in his vile composition be will reply to this and sign his real name so that I may have a chance of defending myself and showing the public who was the real aggressor in bringing about this per- secution, as he calls it. In conclusion, I may add that I will invite this individual that signB himself " Dewson's Ghost" to meet me any dark night he likes., and, perhaps instead of him making my blood run cold and chilly beads of perspiration stand out on my brow, and the freezing shadows of dark despair encompass me, I may turn the tables and cleanse this ghost in such a manner that when he next stands in a Land Court to give evidence as a dummy selector that his utterance will be pure, and not tainted with vile lies that lurk in his composition. -Tours, faithfully, C. P. BAYLY Nov. 1st, 1890.
