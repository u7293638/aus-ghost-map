DEATHS FROM FJUCKT. 'I have interested myself tomewhatin looking up unusual causes of death, ' ' said a well known physician, 'and have met several well-authenticated instances where fright was the cause. The English Surgeon Oeneral Francis tells of a drummer in India across whose legs a harmless lizard crawled when he was half asleep. He was sure that a cobra had bitten him, and it was too much for his nerves, and he died. 'Frederick I. of Prussia was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day she escaped from her keeper, and, dabbling her clothes in blood rushed upon her husband while he was dozing in hie chair. King Frederick imagined her to be the white lady whose ghost was believed to invariably ap pear whenever the death of a member of the Royal Family was to occur, and he was thrown into a fever, and died in six weeks. ' But perhaps the most remarkable death from foar was that of the Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth cen tury. One day he went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch some deaths' heads and skeletons fora picture he intended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching he fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around him and the skeletons suspended from the ceiling clashing together. In a fit of terror he threw himself out of the window, and, though he sustained no serious injury and was informed that a slight earthquake had caused the commotion among hiB ghottly surroundings, he died in a few days in a nervous tremor. ' I could cite many other cases where the shock to the nervous system which we know as fright has produced death.'
