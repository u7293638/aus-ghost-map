THE COQUETTE. j : by john o. baxf,. " You rc clever at drawing, l own, Said my beautiful cousin, Lisette, As we sat by tho window, alone, " But, say, can you paint a coquette ?" " She s painted already, quoth I; ' M Nay, uny," said the laughing Lisetto, " Now, none of your joking— but try ' And paint me a thorough coquette." ".Well, cousin," nt onco I began In tho car of tho ongcr Lisetto, "I'll paint you as well as I can That wonderful thing n coquotto. Sho wears a most beautiful face, (" Of course I" said tho pretty Lisetto,) And is'nt deficient in grnco, Or else she wero not a coquotto. And then she is daintily mado, (A sinilo from the dainty Liscttc,) By pcopto expert in the trado Of forming a proper coquette. . She's tho winningest ways with the beaux, (" Keep on 1" said the winning Lisctte,) But there isn't a mnn of them knows The mind of tho fickle coquette ! Sho knows how to. weep and to sigh, (A sigh from tho tender Lisetto,) But her weeping is all in my oyo— ' Not that of the cunning coquette. In short, she's a creature of art, 0, hush !" said tho frowning Lisctte,) With merely tho ghost of a heart— ' Enough for a thorough coquette. And yet I could easily prove ( Now, don't I" said tho angry Lisctte,) The lady is always in love — In lovo with herself— the coquette. There — do not bo angry — you know, My dear littio cousin Lisetto, You told mo a moment ago, ' To paint yon— a thorough coquette."
