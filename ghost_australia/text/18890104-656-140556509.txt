Christmas Story Competition A CHRISTMAS STORY By J.C.W. Twenty-two years ago, at the request of a friend in Victoria, I went over to inspect a station situated on the Up- per Hunter, 'Whitfield Plains by name. When I had finished my business, it was the 23d of December. I refused the manager's pressing invitation to spend Christmas with him, as I had previously promised my old friend, John Brown, of Galem, that I would if possible spend my Christmas amongst his hospitable family. I had known the Browns intimately in my younger days, and looked forward with pleasure to my visit there, seeing that the oldest daughter, Mary, had been a sweetheart of mine before I left that part of the country to go to Victoria. I left Whitfield on the morning of the 24th, and had a ride of 25 miles to reach Galen. It was real Aus- tralian Christmas weather, far too hot to be pleasant; but as I had a bit of Cessnock blood under me the distance seemed a very small matter. How ever before 1 reached my destination, I was caught in a sudden thunder storm and drenched to the skin, and caught a severe cold in consequence. But more of this anon. On reaching the Brown's homestead, I was met by the master himself and warmly wel comed. It did one good to look upon such a man, of cordial good nature and contentment gleamed from every feature of his handsome face. 'Thrice welcome my boy" he said, grasping my hand and pat ting, me kindly on the shoul der, -'It brings back old time memories to have you here once again. \- Come along ! and see mother and the children; they are all in the schoolroom awaiting you. The house is full of visitors— most of whom you know — as we are keeping Mary's birthday, as well as Christams; but the family wish to give you a welcome from the gaze of comparative strangers.' My reception by the whole family was so warm and pleasant, that for the moment I was fairly overcome, and was troubled with sundry twinges of con science when I remembered I had held their friendship so lightly that I seldom corresponded with them during my long absence in Victoria. This over, we joined the general visitors, most of whom, I either knew person ally or by reputation, and was soon thoroughly at home amongst them. I was rather 'pleased, than otherwise, to see Miss Mary had plenty of ad- mirers, and was rather glad to know that she had not taken my neglect too much to heart; and any momentary regret that I might have felt when I thought of what might have been, soon passed away when I remembered how a certain pair of black eyes would dance and brighten on my return to a certain place in Victoria. In the afternoon twenty couples of us, lads and lassies, had our horses saddled, and went for a canter along the banks of the creek, ostensibly in search of kangaroos to hunt, but were so intent on paying proper attention to our lady companions, that kangaroos troubled us not at all. The latter might be found any day, but the company of an agreeable girl, well mounted, could only be enjoyed upon special occasions such as these, and many momentons questions were asked and answered during that memorable ride. We did not go too far, as there was to be a dance at night, and we did not wish to run any risk of tiring the young ladies. At 6 o'clock we all sat down to a sumptuons dinner, laid out in the spacious lofty dining room, beautifully decorated with flowers and greenery culled from both garden and forest, and as after dinner the room had to be cleared for the dance, we did not linger too long over the meal. Dinner passed off well, and the room and its occupants presented another picturesque scene. During the meal over 40 people were seated at the hos pital board and waited and attended us by four young black nferas, neatly attired in cotton gowns.

He was married, but had no family, and his wife was looked upon as a decent but unfortunate woman in being tied to such a bad lot as Green; but his money commanded respect from a certain class, and as opportunities occurred he purchased three, small stations adjoining, and brought Galen into its present state, and I must admit that for an ignorant bush publican, he showed excellent judgment. He stocked the runs with the best sheep, and still stuck to the public house. On an evil day for himsolf he started from Cassilis in a state of intoxication, and was drowned in the Goulburn river. The widow al lowed the license to lapse, and spent ber time between Sydney and the station. As may be supposed, she, being only middle aged and wealthy, was not wanting in offers from worth less follows who were prepared to take her with all faults. She withstood their attacks for some time, but finally succumbed to the blandishments of a flash young fellow who had spent what money he had amongst the sport ing fraternity of Sydney. For the second time she made a mistake in mar riage. They were married in Maitland and returned to live on the station. From the first her husband (Foley) made no pretence of looking after the property, but was constantly following up racing from one township to another pretty well over the Goulburn district; and in fact carried on so recklessly, and spent so much money, that under ad vice from friends, his wife saw that the time had come when a stop must be put to his carryings on. This was done through lawyers in Sydney, and was the cause of very serious disagreements between the late widow and her young husband. It began to be whispered about that Mrs. Foley, to drown trouble, was in the habit of having recourse to the bottle. Be this as it may, Foley's visits home always had a bad effect on his wife, and after each visit she kept her room (the haunted one) for days to gether. Things came to such a pass at last that Mrs Foley stopped her hus band's credit in the district. This had the effect of bringing him home, and he lived quietly on the station for some time, and the breach between man and wife to all appearance became thoroughly healed, and they visited Sydney together. He had won the confidence of his wife so far during his stay at home that she gave him the power of drawing cheques again, a pri vilege which he abused so flagrantly that he was disgraced, and placed on an allowance. When this occurred the life of the couple became miserable, and when they met they always quarrelled. Mrs Foley was not an educated woman, and it became known to the servants about the station that she always had a large amount, of ready money in her own keeping, and when every other means failed, she always managed to placate her husband with some of this. As time went on things continued to got worse with this ill-assorted couple. Longer absences of the husband, more grog used by the wife, and more bitter quarrels when they met. "Seven years ago, this month, Foley arrived here and gave out that he had come home to spend Christmas with his beloved wife. It was generally known in the neighborhood that he was in debt and was hard pushed for money, and to that fact was attributed his pre sent visit. Be that as it may, his wife was very pleased to have him home again, and made much of him; and up to Christmas they seemed to get on very happily together, during which time there had been no over indulgence in strong waters. On Christmas Eve grog was served out freely to all hands about the place, as usual. The sheep manager and overseer were invited into the house, as was customary at this sea- son, and spent a couple of hours plea santly with their employees, during which time they all (including Mrs Foley) partook freely of the spirituous refreshments. At about eleven o'clock Mr and Mrs Foley retired to their sleeping apartments and for an hour or two afterwards were very noisy, but, as after a time the quarrelling ceased, no notice was taken of the matter. Earlv on the following morning (Christmas Day) the servants were shocked when Mr Foley appeared, as cool as a cucumber, and informed them that their, mistress was dead. When he awoke, he said, he thought his wife was sleeping, but when he shook her in order to rouse her, found she was dead and cold. I have locked the room,' he proceeded, ' and nothing must be touched until the doctor and police come.' ???ll Bill the groom to saddle ???te lope, and you get me some breakfast and I will ride to the township at once. This accomplished, he departed. The people about the place were so taken aback at their master's coolness, that they could do nothing but discuss the matter until his return, but they had a feeling that foul play had been perpe trated. "Foley returned during the day, oc companied by a drunken doctor and a ???^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^om the nearest ^^^^^^^^ ?? the station they ^^^^^^^^ tifa?ly with grog; and ^^^sory examination of the de- ^^^^the doctor certified that disease ^^ the heart had caused death. Foley, ^^after giving instructions for a coffin to ^^ made, and pointing out a spot on the ^^^of the creek where the grave was ^^^dug, went away with the doctor, ^^^said he would return on the mor- ^^^^^^the burial. ^^^^ the married woman and ^^^^^ared the corpse for ^^^^^^^^^the opportunity of ^^^^^^valise, which he ^^^^^^^^and in it the re- ^^^^^^ ?s of laudanum ^^^^^^^ing been re- ^^^^^^^^^^^the?? were ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ght ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ night, beckoning to them as though she wished them to follow her. No notice was taken of this, as it was known they were both much excited and up- set. During the day Foley turned up accompanied by the doctor and some more chosen companions of the same character, assisted at the burial in a drunken manner, settled up with all the household servants, who protested they would not spend another night in the house, under any circumstances, cleared the house of all valuables, which he took away his buggy, locked the place up, and departed for a time -none knew whither. "The station management was not in- terfered with by these occurrences, as the manager had always had his own separate establishment. In course of time, after most of the valuable horses and cattle had been sold by degrees, the station was advertised for absolute sale on a given date in Sydney. I attended the sale and bought the pro perty, a purchase which I have never regretted, notwithstanding the fact that we have on several occasions been put to temporary inconvenience by the re puted appearance of Mrs Foley's ghost at Christmastide. But as the ghost has never been seen by any member of my own family, I may tell you that I don't altogetbor believe in it. This concluding remark jarred on me, especially as I was tired and was suffering from the cold caught early in the day. 'You said ' altogother believe,' Mr B ; surely you don't mean to assert that you have the smallest possible belief in such nonsense.' Before my host could reply, Mrs Brown rose and said, ' Well I am very glad to see you are an unbeliever, Mr ----, as you are to sleep in the lumber room, and will be able to test the matter; and as I per ceive you are suffering from a cold, when you retire I will send you some thing which will cure it.' The story was discussed in all its bearings for a time, and as we were all pretty well worn out, we broke up and retired. Shortly after I reached my room, in answer to a knock, I openod the door, when my kind hostess handed me a large basin of gruel, saying, "Drink this up Mr -----?, and your cold will be better in the morning, I hope; forget all about the ghost, and get to sleep as soon as you can; and don't hurry in the morn- ing, as breakfast will be late." I undressed as I sat on the edge of the bed, and tried hard to drink the gruel, but only managed a small portion of it. I placed it on a small table by the bed side, and left the candle burning, re— solved to rest awhile and try it again. I lay down and fell asleep, but have no idea how long I slept, but was awakened feeling the presence of something un canny in the room. When I opened my eyes I encountered the piercing gaze of a ghastly female figure stand ing at the foot of the bed, beckoning me to follow, I got out of bed, drawn by some magnetic influence which I had no power to resist. The door of the room behind the figure stood open; as I moved towards her; she backed out. I had picked up the lighted candle and gruel basin, and carried them in my hands as I followed my ghastly leader out through the garden which enclosed the house on three sides; into the horse paddock, and away towards the creek my unfortunate guide drew me. I remembered wishing very hear tily that I had been allowed time to dress myself, or at least put my boots on, as the trefoil burrs and thistle seeds were particularly sharp and penetrating to bare feet. I followed my leader into the timber, when she came to a sudden stop, pointed downwards, uttered the word dig, and suddenly dis appeared in a cloud of blue sulphurous smoke. Drawing forward to the spot from which my friendly ghost had dis appeared, I examined the spot to which she had pointed, care fully, but not seeing any thing worthy of notice I resolved to mark the spot for future reference; spilled the gruel about, threw the basin and candlestick down, which I had car ried in my hands all through this weary pilgrimage, retraced my steps, carefully closed the gates and doors after me, and went to bed and to sleep at once. When I woke next morning it was late, and my overnight experiences re- curred to me vividly. On sitting up in bed, preparatory to turning out; ima- gine my surprise and horror on seeing the previously clean counterpane mopped all over with gruel, the basin which had contained it turned upside down on it, with the candlestick lying close by, wrongside up— a nice mess, truly. By degrees it dawned on me that I had been the victim of a singu- larly impressive and disagreeable night mare. I imparted my experiences to my hostess or shortly as possible, and after breakfast was finished was called upon to relate my night's experience in the haunted room, which I did as above. Whilst I was following my ghostly visitor about the paddock, my lady auditors worked themselves into a state of excitement. When the denou- ment came, however, they sighed with disappointment at such a lame con clusion to so promising a beginning. Mrs Brown said 'Well Mr — , of the many stories that have been told in con nection with that haunted chamber by the different gentlemen who have spent a night in it, yours is really the best; and best of all it is true, as before we sat down to breakfast I looked in and saw the bed in exactly the state you describe."
