It might harebcen a month after this visit, it might hare been three weeks—Arthur Wilton could never dhtinfily remember—bat on one evening, when fee twilight, all dashed wife zed and yellow, was stealing away from fee coining night, Anne Hamilton intimated she had been unjust to him in not hearing his explanation before, and when he made it, stars were trembling on fee sky, and team were on her face.
