AUDITING ACCOUNTS. TO THE KDITOB, Sir-f SEW* the public will see the necessity ot haC.nÂ£! Pr9Per, Auditors or will they wait for further ^'tanfflta) It Is not the first time I have heardan auditor say he was noi paia lor such and such wofir. If any one undertakes the duties he is bound to fulfil them, whether paid or not. I con sider that_ an Auditor is the detective officer of an institution, and should be responsible to do the work entrusted to him properly, I have known a gentleman change colour as if about to give up the ghost when he detected 3d. out in any way. Who could, however, allow thousands to be embezzled when every thing came before him cut and dried. An honest and straightforward (though imperfect) accountant is thus intimidated, while the clever rogue goes free. 1 would respectfully suggest that when Auditors are to be ap pointed their names should be publicly sub mitted to the parties interested, and when elected Bhould give guarantees for the due performance of the work. I know that in some instances they are underpaid, but that is no excuse for neglecting their duty. I am, Sir, &c;, R. E. TAPLEY. April 24.
