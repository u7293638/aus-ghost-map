Tho Journal de Constantinople gives tho fol- lowing details respecting Silistria, coming down to tho 2nd instant:-"Letters received from fcliumln, dated the 4th, announce to us fresh at- tacks directed against Silistria on tho 31st of Muy and 2nd of June, in which the Ottoman troops have obtained tho most brilliant success. Unfortunately, this success has been bought at a very dear price by the death of tho heroic com- mandant of chis place, one of the most distin- guished officers of the Ottoman army, Mussa Pasha, who was killed on tho 2nd of June, during thc day time. ,- Ho has died nobly and holily, as he had alu ays lived, for his country and sovereign. In him, Turkey laments. one of her most devoted children. Ho died intrepid and calm, in the midst of his triumph,- after ho lind once moro repulsed au enemy numerically so much superior. His was n nublo heart, that at every post to which thc imperial confidence had called him, always prompted him. to fulfil his duty, and he had made himself beloved by all who served under his orders. Ã„s a soldier he was skilful, courageous, loyal, and pious; ho received tho mortal stroke at tho very moment' he wns beginning to pray, by thanking God for tho new victory vouchsafed to the Ottoman arms. After the attack of tho 29th, tho Russians retired to prepare a fresh assault; and on tho 31st they advanced with considerable forces, making tho assault in tho order they had dono two days before. The struggle was long and desperate, when, repulsed on all sides, they were obliged to retire, in tho evening they sent a Hag of truce, requesting permission to carry away unmolested their, dead, which was granted to thom. They collected 2000 c roses oh thc-field of battle, which the imperial troops wcro able to count from tho top of their ramparts. On the 2nd of Juno, having made fresh dispositions, tho Rus- sians made a general assault, arid attacked thc forts, while their flotilla bombarded tho town. The combat was most murderous and unsuccess- ful for tho Russians, thanks to the heroic intre- pidity of tho imperial troops,' who confronted tho enemy wherever ho appeared. About mid- day, when the fight was gathering in intensity, t! o splinter of a shell struck the left side of Mussa Pasha, who survived but a few minutes, though able to convinco himself before expiring that, thanks to his excellent dispositions and tho valour of tho Ottomans, this attack of the Rus- sians would faro no bettor than tho preceding ono. Towards evening, in fact, the ltussians had succeeded in driving a mine under tho first battery of Arab Tabia; but tho defenders of this fort had been onnblcd to pcrceivo it in time, and j they made a countermine and blew up from 350 to 400 Russians of the storming column, which was holding itself in readiness to carry tho breach when tho mino should have effected its object. Profiting by tho. disorder that tho explosion produced, tho Ottomans inado a vigorous sortie that led to a general defeat of tho enemy, and tho taking of his intrench ments." Tho Sultan (says tho Patrie') on learning tho heroic .death of Mussa Pusho, who lias left scareoly any property, accorded his family a pen- sion of 00,000 piastres.

CAPTAIN GIFFARD'S WIDOW.-The widow of, tho lamented Captain Giffard visited Odessa, in tho Vesuvius, under the safeguard of a flng of truce. She was permitted to land, accompanied by Captain Powell, and remained there twenty four hours collecting particulars of her husband's dying moments, which were thoso of a hero meeting his death in his country's canse. Tho crow of-tho Tiger, on seeing a British naval' uniform pass their placo of confinement, wcro [ about hailing tho wearer with a British cheer, j thinking their moment of deliverance' from'cap- tivity had arrived, but were very judiciously silenced in timo by a' sign,from Captain Fowell. .Tho junior, officers, such os midshipmen and cadets, have been- placed in a'naval college to improve them in their profession"; the seniors aro said to have boen removed to.

On the ' 6th, they, got very drunk in an Odessa "girishop," and a regular fight among themselves was the consequence. The combatants could not bo separated until a detachment of tromps interfered with levelled bayonets.
