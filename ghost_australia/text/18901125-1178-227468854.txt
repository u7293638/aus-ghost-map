THE STATE CARS. (TO TUB EDITOR Of TUB " ACSTRAMAX STAR.") Sir, — I entirely agreo with the comments in your issue of November 22, " It is quite time that a full investigation aud report should be made public. This I think I have a right to demand. The drawings are still accessible, and the bogies of these cars are at Kveloigh. It is singular that the persons who reported so seriously ugainst me, and unused the late commissioner to write the minute rcnil by tho Treasurer the other evening, snw nothing wrong from tiie time these cars were senb out, in May, 1884, until February, 1885. Again, I was allowed to remain in office from tlio dale of said report, March until August 5, 1885, when I was suspended from duty and " charged." The bogies I designed and hail made in the Rudfern shops were taken out anil waggon bogies substituted, and, strange to sav, these were, in 1882, when designed', so defective that 1 had to imtko them fit to carry the O waggons they were intended ior, 354 of which wo now imve, and, although quite new, aro known to be tho woist rolling- stock ou tiie roud. These 70S bogies aro the heaviest, tho most costly, the worst of all. If I remember correctly, Sir Morell Mae- Ucnzio was "charged" with incompetency and murder by certain German x'hysicians. My position is almost identical, and during the pust eight years I have suffered great persecution. The " combination " admitted to he working against mo — although tho bulk of them ure now out of the service— will, perhaps, soon exhibit somo moro of the "ghosts" tlicy have from time to time un veiled in the House. Let thcin, like men, coino to the jiroof, that is all I want; hut up to date 1 cannot get this. I hope, sir, you will insist upon an inquiry now.— Yours, &o.;, TIIOS. MIDELTOjS. November 22.
