CRIO to ET. To the Editor of the Argus. Sir,-I perceive that a match at cricket has been decided on between Sydney and the Colony of Victoria. Now there is a great deal of talk here about this match; and as the membered the Melbourne Cricket Club are the ostensible acre plots of the challenge, and is that club will, it is presumed, produce the chief players, I have taken the trouble to milk mercury afternoon lately to the ground of theM CC to watch the active (?) pt reputations of some of the eleven, and to see as I hoped, some good cricketing. What has been my disgust to see but one of two.mdel.digable gentlemen, not in the elder, and only once or twice have I observed one or two of this mighty eleven ditto to pi notice. Now I can tell them that, to have a ghost of a chance with Sydney, the very best eleven that the colony can produce will be needed, and when they no chosen it will require a daily pinched in their places from this to the time when the in its li comes oil to bring them near upon a level with their antagonists. hope this will be taken in the spirit in which it is present, and that when the day comes we may show that we have not been ne;il-..cttul of the necessary training. I am, Sir, yours, c, AN OLD CRICKETER. Melbourne, February 21,1850.
