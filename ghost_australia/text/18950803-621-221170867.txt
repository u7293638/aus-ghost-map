The Ghost scare. Sydney Errington, the young man who was arrested on Tuesday evening on suspicion of being concerned in the suburban ghost scare, was brought be- fore the Prahran Bench on 1st inst., and charged with "insulting behavior." Sub-Inspector James, who appeared on behalf of the police, asked the bench to deal with the accused under section 191, sub section 2 of the Justices Act. This section provided that sentence could be suspended pending good be- havior for a stated period. Constable J. S. Murray, of South Yarra, stated that he arrested the ac- cused in Great Davis street, South Yarra, in consequence of what he had heard. He found him wearing a false red beard, a red cap, spectacles, and several pieces of sticking-plasterâ€”all of which were produced in court. Sub-inspector James: The Rev Mr Priestly, who is present, could give the accused a good character. His father is in poor circumstances. Mr Keogh: It would be well for this young man to discontinue these pranks at night. He might meet with a man who would give him a severe thrashing, Mr Sievwright: He will not do it again. Mr Keogh: The accused is discharged. The Court was crowded during the hearing of the case.
