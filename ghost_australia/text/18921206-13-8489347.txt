I A WOMEN'S DEBATING CLUB BY A.L.F. We are all theorists, more or less, but it is a grand thing when we can put our theories to the test Sometimes the theory stands the ordeal, and then it becomes stronger and more perky than ever-indeed, rechristened itself a fact. Sometimes it doesn't, and drags on an invalid existence till it dies altogether I had always stoutly maintained that a successful Women's Debating Club was among the possibilities, but in my heart of hearts, I confess it now, lingered misgivings lest we might be too imperfectly trained, have inherited too many feminine imperfections and perversities to compare with our brothers I lately received an invitation to the concluding evening (for the session of the Women's Debating Club of the Melbourne University I promptly accepted, struck by the independent attitude of the club as re gurgled hours, a desire for convenience rather than conventionality having evidently inspired it I was invited to afternoon tea at half-past 5 in the women s common room, after wards to a debate on the subject, "has Heredity or Environment the Greater In licence upon Character ' I found that the study of the undistributed middle and of the origin of the second const did not prevent the room from looking very bright and cosy Little tables were dotted about, gay with flowers and laden with good things, while learned nymphs in flowing college gowns dispensed potent cups of tea, and a hospitable welcome along with them (PS-That wasn't instead of lump sugar ) There was not more chatter than might have been expected considering that out of every trio of girls two were talking the whole time Seventy girls and not a solitary man appeared, not the ghost of one, unless the pictured dignity of the Venerable Chancellor looking down us might so be termed I began to feel, as a recent eminent v visitor to the colonies has put it, that " the world was made for women also I never was so important, collectively speaking, before It has often amused me to observe that in histories and books of travel a chapter is always set aside for "women and marriage " If the world were managed altogether on the lines of the Melbourne University Ladies' Debating Club, the other sex would be the outsiders, and the chapter would be headed, " Men and marage ' We afterwards adjourned down stairs to the hallowed hall, where the law professor instructs fledgling barristers in the m) stones of torts and contracts The chair was filled by a young lady whose fur trimmed robe announced that she had attained to the dignity of a bachelor of arts After the minutes of the previous meeting had been read and confirmed, the chairman (do let me call her so-called upon the medical disputant to open the debate Dr is young, with a girlish, unassuming and deplorably unprofessional manner, but that did not prevent her making out a very good case for the force of inherited charge teristic The respondent had a carefully prepared reply, but somehow she gave me the idea all the time that she was not speaking from her coin actions, but taking the opposi- tion view for the sake of a good argument. I hope I may be excused if I do her injustice The fun of the evening was to come the next speaker had proved herself with some ingeniously contrived example of mixed mar ages very much mixed and the probable result on the offspring The instance was something like this A has a Dutch father and a Scotch mother, the Dutch father had a Polish mother, and the Scotch mother had a French father By this time the audience were getting a little bit out of their depth and the speaker was requested to begin over again, but the mother a father was a Pole this time, and the father's mother turned out a French woman lins posterior i argument was beyond the audience, and the speaker collapsed amid much merriment The Creeks, about this time, began to harass me for each speaker took the great men of Attica to prove her own side, till I began to consider them as a ball flung from one side to the other, particularly Demosthenes and his pebbles, which were in great request twins were about the biggest card scored by the heredity advocates, because if they are alike they remain alike, and if they are hopelessly unlike or disparate similar conditions seem to affect them quite differently Of course, by this time there had been a good deal said about free will All roads lead to Rome, and all philosophical discussions reach sooner or later that insoluble problem The advocates of free will were many, but one lady was an uncompromising necess tartan Indeed, she wound up with a statement so extraordinary that until I know her better I shall take to be satire that what we are we are and that by no act of will can we change our future, but that what we are we have made ourselves We once had the choice offered us Query - When " No, I think that must have been a ponderous joke The rising of the last speaker of all was eagerly awaited I was whisperings informed that Miss -vv as waiting till everybody had spoken in order to state them all round She is very tall, with a bright eager face, and has a curious habit of shifting her college gown higher upon the shoulder It gives one the impression that she is pulling up her sleeves to be ready for the fray She is the humourist of the club, and created a laugh by saying that she had not been able to make up her mind beforehand and was less than ever able to do so now, that there was much to be said in favour of either side and a great deal more against both The voting then took place, the humourist, on account of her superior inches, being deputed to stand on a chair and count heads Die voting went with the opener by a large majority At the eminently safe and comfortable hour of half-past 8 all was over and the cloisters of learn ing deserted The whole debate might itself have been taken as a well chosen instance of the effect of environment and a most cogent argument for its power All the intellectual defects and the moral pettinesses that we have been told from time immemorial were inherent in woman were in these girls conspicuous by their absence I have never been present at any discussion where the point in question was more closely adhered to Nor was there an atom of personal feeling imported into the debate, which was conducted with courtesy and quite an personally, though criticism was frank and occasionally severe The rules of debate were duly respected, and a gentle touch on the chairman s bell brought the most eager speakers to an immediate close
