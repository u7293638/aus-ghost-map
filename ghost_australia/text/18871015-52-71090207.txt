Our Prize Story Competition. t With, the present issue of the TOWN AND COTJN* . TRY JOURNAL the publication of the first series of competitive tales is concluded. It remains now for our readers to undertake the work of deciding the five stories which are most meritorious, and, therefore, entitled to the prizes offered. The publication has extended over no less than forty-one Saturdays, and includes 117 stories. Some of the competitors may think this time unreasonably long. But it was, as they will perceive upon consideration, utterly impossible to have crowded so many tales into a shorter period. For the convenience of the judges, how ever, and in-order to refresh their memory, we have thought it well to publish now a list of all the stories, with the dates upon which they ap peared in the TOWN AND COUNTRY JOURNAL, This list is as follows : Jan. 8.
