HIS HOTEII BILL. A novel dodge was employed, says a Paris correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, by an individual gifted with ventriloquial powers to avoid paying his hotel bill. For several nights the visitors at the hostelry in question had been disturbed by loud cries for help that emanated seemingly from a woman on the second story. Everyone turned out into the passages, thinking one of the visitors was in his death throes, but an examination of the apartment at once demonstrated that no tragedy,had taken place there. The noises that issued from the room were certainly of a most distressing kind—gasps and moans mingling with mournful and shrill cries, occasionally varied by imitations of a child in its death agonies, and eerie sounds suggesting the proximity of a ghost. Some hinted that the house was haunted; but the manager, inore practical, sent for a police inspector o to keep an all-night vigil in the room. On that occasion no sound was heard, but, strange to relate, the occupant of the adjoining apartment had vanished next morning. In his place he left a note saying that he exorcised the spirits that troubled the household, and had carried them off with him. He considered this service was at least equivalent to the bill of 120 odd francs he owed the landlord, and thus both could cry quits. The proprietor has thought otherwise, and the police are now actively searching for this imitator of Valentine Vox.— Coolgardie Pioneer.
