PAST AND PRESENT. I STOOD in fancy 'mid the blackened walls Where lately rose the Royal, and my thought, Which wanders lightly thro' the airy halls Of past and future, into being brought The perished pomp of boxes, pit, and stalls, The stage where ROMEO sighed and RICHARD fought, And HAMLET, fretting for a father lost, Raved, ramped and died, but ne'er gave up the ghost! I stood, I say, amid the ruins, gazing Into the convolutions of the past, Which hides away so many things amazing, And fills with contrasts the unfathomed vast; Our palace here is building, there is blazing, Now jubilant the owner, now aghast; Here merry thousands enter, cheer, and chatter— There at the crackling doors the firemen batter! Such tricks plays Time, that thievish rook, that raven! What pranks has he indulged these seventeen years! What ships sent forth that never reached a haven, What scrip emitted—forfeit for arrears! Boys getting born then, now are getting shaven; And—tell it not in Gath—angelic dears, Married and matroned, venturing con. crimin., Now all unfeathered, show themselves mere women! But raking in these embers of old days I stirred old deeds, and saw in pristine glory The Royal—rich in players and in plays— BROOKE and MONTGOMERY with their tragic story, SULLIVAN, ANNA BISHOP, CATHERINE HAYES, KEAN, MATTHEWS, JEFFERSON—memento mori, Attached so oft!—but what that horrid noise? The voices of the dead?—No, saveloys! Hot saveloys!—whereat my stately vision Dissolved into the circumambient air, Leaving me like an object of derision, To wonder what the world I wanted there; The yawning desolation urged decision, From every brick the moral seemed to stare, And even the wrinkled zinc in creakings spoke: "Most projects, silly mortal, end in smoke!"
