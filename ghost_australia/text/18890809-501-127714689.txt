A Ghost at Germanton. The local correspondent of the Albury Mail gives the following version of the vision : â€” On Friday night as a gentle man well known here was returning to the township by a lonely road, he was greatly startled by the sudden appear ance of a man on horseback who seemed to arise out of a neighbouring dam or waterhole, and after crossing the road by which he was proceeding disappeared in a mysterious manner. The same un earthly' visitant is reported to have been seen by two old residents of the district some 18 months ago, and who are pre pared to vouch for the accuracy of their statement, so muoh so that neither care to pass that way after nightfall. In both caBes the ghoBtly visitant is said to be riding a gray cob. That some dis contented spirit is dissatisfied with his mode of exit from this Bublunary sphere is evident but why bring the spirit of his horse 1 Why not let the spirit of his Bucephalus rest in the happy hunt ing ground 1 But perhaps the horse wishes to gazo on the pastures where once he fed. It is said that one or two venturesome individuals purpose inter viewing his ghostship.
