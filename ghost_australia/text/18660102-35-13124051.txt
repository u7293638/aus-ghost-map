The building was to be called Wesley Church, and by that name it would be known as one of the ecclesiastical edifices of this city. The cost would be something over £5000 The accommodation was calculated for 700 adults and SCO child in a few months from this time, it was hoped, the building would be finished, the contractor paid, and the house itself filled with the presence and power of the Most High An elegant mallet and silver trowel were then handed to Mrs G W Allen, who, thereupon, performed the acre even of laying the stone The trowel bore the following inscription Presented by the trustees to Mrs G. W Allen, on the occasion of her laying the foundation stone of Wesley Church, Chippendale, January 1st, 1866 Rev J. Bickford, Rev R Sellors, Circuit Ministers Mr. T. Rowe, architect Mr G W Allen said, it devolved upon him, on behalf of his wife, to express to them her very great gratification their requested to lay the foundation stone of of Wesley Church He regarded it not merely as a compliment to ourselves but as a recognition of the services and a tribute to the memory of the Rev Mr Boyce, who during his ten years'' residence in the colony had taken up his abode and laboured in this circuit It was mainly through the exertions and influence of the Rev Mr Boyce and of Mr Allen that 'he land in Parramatta street had been obtained, and by the proceeds of the sale of which the present church would in great measure be erected. He (the speaker had been one of the first stewards in the circuit, and had had the honour of laying the foundation stone of three chapels in it since its separation. He well remembered the diligent and faithful labours of the Rev. Mr Lewis who For clothed and happy spirit would, doubtless, if permitted to look upon what was now being done, tnkogieat interest in the proceedings of this day It was an important and a solemn duty in which we had just been engaged, and they would allow him to express his great sympathy in the work and his desire to assist as far aBho possibly could He was also glad to know that this church would be built without incurring any very large debt, and he hoped without trenching too much on the liberality of our friend" He trusted that the blessing of God would rest upon our undertaking, and that the church to be built upon this foundation would be a lasting benefit not to the con- gi Legation only, but to the whole neighbourhood In the words of the hymn he would say - These nails vic to the honouring, Long may they echo to thy praise 1 And. thou, descending, fill the place M Uli choicest tokens of thy grace And in the great decisive day, When Coil the nations shall survey, May it before the world appear, that crowds were born to glory here. The Rev Star inN Raiione said that their object, even when stripped of its religious character and viewed from any point, was one of deep interest and importance to every philanthropist He believed that there were not many persons but would admit that if we were to Davanthus country an industrious sober population, a thriving, happy, and a prosperous community we must in addition to halls of commerce mechanics' institutes, and schools of arts, also have sanctuaries for the worship of the one living and true God He was satisfied that even to accomplish the material and worldly interest of the community, it was necessary to make them Christians, and it was essential that chapels and churches should be erected in every part of the land. The institutions already named had their interest and value, but we were not prepared for a moment to admit any comparison between them and the house of God as to their worth and importance Many great advantages might be derived from these institutions, but one thing was needful, and it was to supply that need that we were now assembled to commence the erection of a house of God, in which his gospel was especially to be proclaimed in which his word was to be expounded-his holy sacra- ments were to be administered, and in which the parents and children of this locality were to be taught the right ways of the Lord He most emphatically said that the great end in the work now begun and before us was the glory of the Divine Name and the salvation of immortal souls Wo yielded to none in our desire for the temporal and worldly interests of our fellow-men, and, as he trusted, but to few in our efforts to promote those interests The deepest conviction of our nature was, that to do this most certainly and effectually we must by all means attempt to secure their personal salvation The building, thereon dation stone of which had just been laid, would be a Wesley an church We did not announce this as expecting it to recommend the work to every individual of the commu- met The time was when, as a section, we were every- where spoken against, but that time had passed away As a Methodist church, the services in it would generally be conducted by Wesleyan minister, and in it would be preached what was sometimes designated Wesleyan due time It was not so designated because it had no foundation in the word of God, for he believed that nothing was taught or received among us as essential to salvation but what was based upon the eternal truth of God in this sanctuary would be taught the doctrine that there is but one God-that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons (he rather, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, equal in substance, power, and glory The plenary inspiration both of the Old and New Testament Scriptures was a doctrine which would also be proclaimed in this house of pro} or They would here be taught that the eternal Son of God became the mortal foe of man, and in the union of the Divine and the human nature in his one person he became the Moderator, the Press, and Sacrifice for all mankind They would here preach (he glad and glorious doctrine of the atonement the personality of the Holy Spirit the justification of the sinner instrumental through faith in Jesus Christ, He would tell them no more of what would be preached, and of what they already knew was preached but he would here take the liberty to say that the practice of itinerary as obtaining' among us, would come into operation in relation to this Sanctuary as to all others, but notwithstanding this, they never heard of a difference in doctrine in Methodist sanctuaries on the essential virtuoso God's Holy Word He hoped that the supplication in the opening prayer would be answered, that a spirit of liberality and generosity would be poured upon the people. We had little to say for the architecture of the old building Our tastes had perhaps improved success election, our numbers had increased, our means had been enlarged, and we hoped that the glory of this latter house would far exceed that of the old one That had a glory, and let no man think meanly of it Around that old building were clustered delightful reminiscences, and there were to-day praising God in heaven those who had found the Saviour of sinners there, and there were many wending their way to heaven this afternoon who had there found the pearl of great price To this and fo himself hundreds of times it had been none other than the house of God and the very gate of heaven Our hope and prayer was that this house now to be erected should excel, especially in the latter respects, the glory of the former, that the Lord our God, the God of our fathers would bless us and make us as a thousandfold so many as we were The proceedings were closed with the Doxology Soon after the service in the afternoon, a tea meeting was held in the schoolrooms, and at night a public meeting took place in the chapel Both gatherings werevorynume rously attended The Rev R SELLORS offered prayer Mr Josef ii Wearne occupied the chair, and began the business of the evening by some remarks appropriate to the occasion. The Rev Joseph Oram addressed the meeting He hoped that the new church would not only surpass the one in which they were assembled as to its Rfjloandaiuiuuslons, but that it would like so far exceed it is spmtupl beauty and the moral excellence which would result He thought they might raise £1000 to night, and hoped that they would do it The Rev William Curnow congratulated the congregation on the prospect they had of getting a larger and a better building than this, and he hoped that the work commenced to day would go on to a triumphant and glorious completion The old structure e was to stand, it would be a mo mento of the past, and it might perhaps serve to prevent them from becoming proud He trusted that they would never lose their old Methodistic identify Methodism was not perfect, but there were spots in the sun, and our Church was just about as white as others He vvontmfor a Church with a head and a heart, and our principal aim should be to adapt our Church, to the undying heart and head of mankind. The speaker then proceeded to defend the organisation of the Wesleyan denomination in respect to itinerary, contending that the changes periodically made at the end of (three years were less frequent, from a variety of causes, than occurred in other denominations He believed in apostolic succession, and was firmly convinced that his brother Bickford was as much a bishop as was Dr Tait, the Bishop of London The work of the ministry was most arduous, and required the highest ability, but its rewards in the gratitude of those who were benefited more than compensated for all the dials first wore incident to it. The Rev S Barone was not going to make a speech, as he understood that this was to be a business meeting They were all entitled to give something, and he hoped that they would not go under they had delivered themselves on this point. The Rev James Bickford invited the meeting to come forward with their contributions Gentlemen were then appointed to go round to the audience, and a considerable sum was given and subscribed for The meeting was closed with devotional exercises
