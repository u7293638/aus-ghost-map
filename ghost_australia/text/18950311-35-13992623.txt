"NO LETTERMENT, NO TAX." TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-In your able article of last Wednesday's data IS exposed completely the injustice and absurdity of this latest of all vagan of 3 of Mr Wise and his following involved in the amendment of which that game tleman has given notice in relation to the threatened land tax Now, I know a gentleman who recently purchased a number of acres of land on the Northern line, for which he paid £110 per acre, the advantages comprised in the proximity of the line and railway station being, of course, considered in the price charged him But he bought not directly of the State, and to say that, because of that circumstance, he should be taxed in contradistinction to the man who may have bought direct from the Crown is to my mind monstrous, and shows a lack of moral sense confined let us hope,, only to those legislators, returned to Parliament by constituents who having been worked up to an unhealthy excitement by foolish, ill-considered speeches had become temporarily beside themselves They are now recovery mp, and the single taxers in Parliament have discovered it It is wonderful how you come to think of it, the great sirathaHU between the land reform leaguers and H George Mr Pulsford, in his letter of the 4th instant, very cleverly put before your readers (he inconsistent of this new departure though 11 a , somewhat different way When Henry George first I began to poison the minds of our people his programme admitted of no exemptions under any circumstances whatever but before he left these shores he allowed that it might be equitable, and perhaps would be necessary, to exempt Crown purchasers from the tax In like manner Mr Wise and his party who were returned to Parliament on a distinct issue (which was Dandaloo taxation-no oxemption)havosiucebecome converted, as was If G before them As I have not inquired into whatever to the partial conversion of the latter gentleman I am not going to examine too closely into what led Mr Wise and his friends to vary their programme that is a matter for their constituents who also know better than I do if they are as much their representatives to-day, now that they have departed from it Reverting for a moment to the principle of no betterment, no tax" 'Very few I take it, except those personally concerned will re-let that theo landowners whoruilH have greatly üí,nehtted 1 > State expenditure will be require to pay something in support of the State but surely very few will follow Mr W is in his desire to confiscate these persons' property, for that is what it must come to ultimately if the amount of tax collected from land is to equal that now received through the Customs Mr Wise doubtless will say Is of to this Perhaps he does not yet quite know what he means by o can only judge him from what he says from time to time It will be a general s satisfaction when this ghost is laid to rest for ever no living man can tell and no future historian will be able to estimate the great loss inflicted on this country by the mere threat alone of the tax inasmuch as improvements every here Jinvo encountered a severe check the heart being taken out of the people Much has been said about gambling in land and getting rid of the speculative element by means of taxation Lnhmited specula- tion might be a great evil, but it is not so certain that during it to the vanishing point, as is the case now, is an unmixed good The letter which is reared in the Jura of Thursday in reply to Mr Pulsford, does not help to lift Mr W lso out of the mud and without desiring to trespass on Mr Pulsford's manor I may be per mitted d to inquire why, if Mr Wise has not changed front he his moved an amendment on IIIB original programme 9 for surely he will not deny that his first ] reposais treated all alike none were to be exempted It would seem that he considers that all the exists of fortunate chance and sound judgment in investments are not lightly the property of the speculator in dealings in land If this principle obtains in legislation, one can be very sure it will not be allowed to stop at dealings in land I cannot., WILLIAM.
