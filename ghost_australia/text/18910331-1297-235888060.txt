THE REY. CHARLES CLARK LEC TURES. After a lengthened tour through New Zealand tbe Rev. Charles Clark has returned ugaiu to Sydney to give u short farewell season prior to his departure for England. The lecture enter- tainment last night wu9 tbe recital of Dickens' Christmas carol. Although there were so many powerful attractions elsewhere, and although Mr. Clark has given the same recital absoiuteiy numberless times before, the Centenary -hall iu York-street was comfortably full in all parts. There is scarcely a person who has learned the rudiments of tho English language who has not road or spelt out the " Christmas Carol ." Scrooge and Marley's Ghost and Bob Cratchit anu Tiuy Tim are almost as familiar to us as our own names. "We lose nothing but gain much by hearing Mr. Clark recite the immortal work. It revives pleasant memories, with some of us it vitalises the characters and presents them to us more completely than perhaps we have understood them before ; while features which might have passed uunoticed iu careless or desultory readiug are recognised go an in tegral part of the whole work, and us essential to a thorough comprehension of tho author's conceptions. To-night t Air. .Clark will giro his lecture on "Thackeray."
