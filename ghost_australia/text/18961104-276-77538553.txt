THE FLOWER OF THE HOLT GHOST. [The above name ia given to a most remarkable flowering plant recently discovered in the forests of Panama ] Beneath the glare of the tropical day, In summer's shine and shower, On a lovely plant in a forest lone There blooms a wonderful flower. And the parent stem is full of grace, And the leaves are fresh aud fair; And the fainting traveller marvels to find A plant so lovely there, For the deadly serpent glides unseen, And the fever floats around, And the pestilence lurks in the herbage rank That covers that dangerous ground. But there by the leaves of heavenly green The wondrous blo soms shew, More fair than the fairest flowers of the earth And white as the stainless show. And lo! in the heart of each bloom there rests The image of a dove, With folded wings an emblem true Of purity and love. And the traveller Bees in this wonderful flower A bloom of the Eden lost, And he blesses his God, and he namea the bloom The Flower of The Holy Ghost. And BO in the heart of man there grow*, la summer shine and shower, Far hidden away in a eeoret plaoe, The bloom of a wonderoua flower. And the white dove sits with folded wings On its lily petals fair, And the traveller blesses his God who finds This holy emblem there. For he sees in the sacred bloom of the soul A bloom of the Eden lOBt, And he names the bloom of the wonderful plant The Flower of the Holy Ghost. But the serpent glides in the herbage near, And the terer floats around, And the pestilence rides on the steamy air, And dangerous is the ground. ROBERT CALDWELL, M.P.
