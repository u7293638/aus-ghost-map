MERINO, !-' (FROM OUE OWN CORRESPONDEKT. ) .Tnnn 14. The wet weather has now set io again, and many.-wiU be tire complaints of tbe state of the reads, especially between here and Port- land, ihe earners state that the roads are HOW almost as sad as they can be. it is now raining hard. . The football season -having commenced, I . waewxpectingto hear of a clnb of some art bring formed In Merino ; but nothing has ban done in the matter yet, and I am afraid it .will be left nntil it is too late, jnBt as tbe formation of a cricket clnb waa last season. On toe 8th inst., the Merino Mutual Im provement Association held its third meeting, which was well attended. In fool the society seems to be going ahead, in spite of the prophesies that it would end in smoke. There were over a dozen gentlemen and sbont half a dozen ladies present. The subject of toe essay was "Cremation," written by Mr. Adamson, and read by that gentleman, it was a very able and Interesting one, treating orr the various modes of disposing of the dead in India and the East, and arguing that the new mode of borning the bodies— new to ns bat old in other countries — was more advantageous in every way, and cheaper than buriaL The eaaayest also gave an ac- count of the principles upon which toe burn ing was proposed to be carried on. The matter was then freely entered upon by some of the members, bnt not as many as were expected. However, when we get a little more need to it, and get a little more confi- dence, we rib all have more animated debates. On Thursday next the Rev. Mr. Bnilns is to give an essay on "Ghosts," which, 1 have no donbt will prove very interesting. . The police station, where aenior-conntAhU Kennedy lost so many of his children, has been undergoing a thorongh disinfecting and repainting. It is .now again in toe occnpa- tion of Mn Kennedy and family.
