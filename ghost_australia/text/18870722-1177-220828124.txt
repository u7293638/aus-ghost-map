Shying Horses are Near- Sighted. "WHY it is that shying in horses should be set down to an ugly dis- position I don't know," said a promi- nent veterinary surgeon. "It must be because horsemen don't know what else to lay it to. The fact is that it is seldom met with unless the horse is near-sighted. I have tested scores of shying horses for near-sightedness, and in nearly all cases found what I expected. And now when I am asked to give points on buying horses I give this as one of the requisites: Never buy a horse that is near-sighted. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule. If the horse is to have a mate, then it doesn't matter about the sight. One horse can go blind if the other is clear- sighted. If the horse is to be used for riding in saddle be careful that he is not near-sighted, for he will throw you sooner or later. "The reason why a near-sighted horse shies is very simple," the surgeon continued. "Of all animals the horse is the most gentle, and even timid. He sees a strange object, and his sus- ceptible mind magnifies it into a mon- ster that is going to devour him. A piece of white paper on the roadside at night is a ghost, and an old wag- gon in the ditch is a dragon. Every horseman knows that if you drive the animal close to the dreadful object the animal cools down at once. It is sup- posed that it is because the horse makes a closer acquaintance with the object. That is true, but not in the sense in which it is generally under- stood. The animal has not been able to see it from a distance. He is near- sighted."
