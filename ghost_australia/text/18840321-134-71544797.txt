MOE. (From a correspondent.) Monday, Fecruary 17. In justice to your civil engineer, Mr James Campbell, of Traralgon, and Mr William Hampton of Moe, contrac tor, I must say that the large bridge over the Lat obe river here, no r com pleted, is one of the most substan tial and creditable bridges in South Gipprland. Ar.vy person visiting our district must undoubtedly be taken absck with the view of the structure and its permanency The whole piles being of round timber, driven well with a pile driver, ten feet on either side of the pier, and all held together with whaling 40ft long; in addition to this a dinconal whaling, from top of pile to main bridge, strengthens the structure. ft will, I verily believe, be a principle which will be adopted by other engin oers in the future history of Gippsland bridges. It would I think take up too much space to explain the many merits etc. of the bridge, but the money paid by our shire of Narracan to Mr Camp bell for the design and plans of the bridge will bethe most beneficial money sid by the council since its existence ; Id incerely hope that in future our Council will, on any occasion where important bridges are roquirrd, have them dresiged on the same principle tirhs bridge. Speaking of the con ractor, it must be said he has most rejitably carried out his contract a' hough his price was very low, the :ollowrngbeing about the price terdete Sth:e bridge contractors for the wolrk -1lr Hampton, £487, accepted b. rhe council; Mr W. A. Gay being text at £570; Mr Johnson being th. next at £675. It was with greae energy that Mr Hampton carried out ris work with such satisfaction and profit to himself. It has been rumored trht the "Moe Thost" has been seen again one night ast week, it is now in close proximit% o the railway station. This time a oman with 4 heads and 2 horns, but is not made much public yet; hey had enough of the last Moe ghost ,nd Constable -- about two years re.
