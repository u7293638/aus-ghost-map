How is yours, sir?" skiving no reply, he repeated his feflStJon, glancing over his shoulder perceiving, as he thought, the iptain buBy writing on his slate, .^o answer. Thereupon he rose ; fi'ashe fronted the cabin door, the "gore he had mistaken for the captain raised its bead, and disclosed to the astonished mate the features of an entire stranger. Bruce was no coward; but, as he met that fixed gaze looking directly at him in grave silence, ana became assured that it was- no one whom he Iiad ever seen before, it was too much for him; and, instead Of stopping to question the seeming intrujier, he rushed up<?n deck in such evident alarm that it instantly attracted the captain's attention. " Why, Mr. Bruce," said the latter' " what in the world is the matter with you?" " The matter, sir ? Who is that at your desk ?'r "No one thai I know of." "But there is, sir: there's a stranger there." "A stranger! Why, man you must be dreaming. You must have seen the steward there, or the second matei Who else would venture down without orders ?" 1 " But, sir, he was sitting in your arm chair, fronting the door, writiiigon your slate. Then he looked up fullinmyfaoe; and, if ever I saw a man plainly and distinctly in this world, I saw him." 4* "Him! Whom?" " God knows, sir: I don't. J saw a man, and a man I had never seen in my life before." "You must be going crazy, Mr. Bruce. A stranger, and we nearly six weeks out 1" "I know, sir; but then I sato him." " Go down, and see who it is." Bruce hesitated. " I never was a believer in ghosts," he said; "but, if the truth must be told, sir, I'd rather not face it alone/' "Come, come, man. Go down at once, and don't make a fool of yourself before the crew." " I hope you've always "found me willing to do what's reasonable," Bruce replied, changing colour; " but if it's all the same to you, sir, I'd rather we should both go down together." The captain descended the stairs, and the mate followed him. Nobody in the cabin ! They examined the state rooms. Not a soul to be found! " Well, Mr. Brace," said the captain, " did not I tell you, that you had been dreaming ?" " It's all very well to say so, sir; but if I didn't see that man writing on your slate, may I never see my home and family again 1" " Oh I writing on the slate! Then it should be there still." And the captain took it up. " By God 1" he exclaimed, " here's something, sure enough! Is that your writing Mr. Bruce ?" The mate took the slate; and there in plain legible characters, stood the words, "Steer to the nor'west." "Have i you been trifling with me, sir?" added the captain, in a stern manner. " On my word as a man and as a sailor, sir," replied Bruce, " I know no more of the matter than you do. I have told you the exact truth." The captain sat down at his desk, the slate before him, in deep thought. At last, turning the slate over and pushing it towards Bruce, he said, "Write down, * Steer to the nor'west."' The mate complied; and the captain, after narrowly comparing the two handwritings, said, " Mr. Bruce, go and tell the second mate to come down here." He came ; and at the captain's request, he also wrote the same words; So did the steward ; So, in succession, did every man of the crew who could at all. But not one of the various hands resembled, in any degree, the mysterious writing. When the crew retired, the captain sat deep in thought. " Could any one have been stowed away ?" at last he said. " The ship must be searched; and if I don't find the fellow he must be a good hand at hide-and-seek. Order up all hands." Every nook and corner of the vessel, from stem to stern, was thoroughly searched, and that with all the eager ness of excited curiosity, - for the 196 report had gone out that a stranger Bad shewn himself on board; but not a living soul beyond the crew and the officers ^ ere found. Returning to the cabin after their fruitless search, .' Mr Bruce," said the captain, "what do you make of all this?" '* Can't tell, sir. I saw the man wfite; yoit see the writing. There must be something in it." " Well, it would seem so. We have the wind free, and I have a great mind to keep her away and See what will come of it." ' " I surely would, air, if 1 were in your place. It's only a few hours lost, at the worst." j- saoy; " Well, we'll <06 teideck and give the cottrs^ n^^^^ . 1 Ah<!, Mr. Bruce," he adde$, to go, "have a loo^^^i^fti^lt^Ietit be a hand you elfl His orders were obeyed. w/vkj.eo offj [!t;; About three o^l^lt^ ^#e^d&k-ont; reported an icebt(^neafl¥ a^ad, and, shortly after, what he'tho^h'C #as a vessel of some kind cfos^ to'it. As they approached the eaptaih'a glass disclosed the fact that it was a dis mantled ship, apparently frozen to the ice, and with a good many human ! beings on it. Shortly after they^feove to, and sent out the boats to the relief of the sufferers. It proved to M a vessel from Quebec, bound to Lifer pool, with passengers on board' -She had got entangled in the ice, and finally frozen fast, and had passed several weeks in a most critical situa tion. She was stove, her deck swept -in fact, a mere wreck ; all her pro visions and almost all her water gone. Her crew and passengers had lost all hopes of being saved, and their grati tude for the unexpected rescue was proportionately great. As one of the i men who had been brought away in the third boat that had reached the ,'wreck was ascending the ship's side, j the mate, catching a glimpse^ of his _ | face, started back in consternation. It t was the very face he had seen three OT 1 four hours bofore, looking up at him from the captain's desk. At first he " You say that is your handwriting ?" said he. "I need not say so," rejoined the other, looking at it, " for you saw me write it." " And this ?" said the captain, turn ing the slate over. The man looked first at one writing, and then at the other, quite confounded. At last, " What is the meaning of this ?'* said he. " I only wrote one of these. "Who wrote the other ?" " That's more than I can tell you, sir. My mate here say you wrote it, sitting at this desk, at noon to-day." The captain of the wreck and the passengers looked at each other, ex changing glances of intelligence and surprise ; and the' former asked the latter, '. Did you dream that you wrote on this slate ?" " No, sir, not that I remember." "You speak of dreaming," said the captain of the barque. " What was this gentleman about at noon to-day ?" "Captain," rejoined the other, "the whole thing is most mysterious and extraordinary ; arid I had intended to speak to you about it as soon as we got a little quiet. This gentleman," (pointing to the passenger,) "being much exhausted, fell into a heavy sleep, or what seemed such, some time before noon. After an hour or more he awoke, and said to me,' Captain, we shall be relieved this very day.' When I asked him what reason he had for saying so, he replied that he had dreamed that he was on board a barque, and that she was coming to our rescue. Se de scribed her appearance and rig; and, to our utter astonishment, when your vessel hove in sight she corresponded exactly to his descriptiom of her. We had not put much faith in what he said; yet still we hoped there might be something in it, for drowning men, you know, will catch at straws. As it has turned out, I cannot doubt that it was all arranged, in some incomprehensible way, by an overruling Providence, so that we might all be saved. To Him be all thanks for His goodness to us." tried to- persuade himself it might be ' fancy; but the more he examined the man the more sure he became that he was right. Not only the face, but the persoii and the dress exactly corre- j Bponded. As. soon as the exhausted crew and famished passengers were cared for, and the barque on her course again, the mate called the captain aside. "It seems that was not a ghost I saw to-day, sir; the man's alive." "What do you mean? Who's alive ?" (i Why^ sirj one of the passengers we have Js the man I saw writing on your slate at noon.

The captain replied that he had but done what he was certain they would have done for K;Jum under the same circumstances, and w a$ked them both to step down into the lsi45fkibin. Then turning to the passenger, 5 said, " I hope, sir, you will ,not i9$Wnk I am trifling with you; but I irf^ould be much obliged to you if you m/WOHld write a few words on this slate," n&tod-; he handed him the slate, with that furtide up on which the mysterious writing was not. " I will do anything you ask," re plied the passenger; " but what shall I write ?" " A few words are all I want; uppose you write, 4 Steer to the nor'west/" The passenger, evidently puzzled to make out the motive for such a request, complied, however, with a smile. The captain took up the slate and examin ed it closely; then, stepping aside, so as to conceal the slate from the pas senger, he turned it over, and gave it to him again with the other side up, " There Is not a doubt/' rejoined the other captain, " that the writing on the slate, let it hare come there as it may, saved all your lives. I was steering at the time considerably south of west, and I altered my course to norVest, and had a look-out aloft, to see what would come of it. But you say," he added, turning to the passenger, " that you did not dream of writing on a slate?" "No, sir. I have no recollection Whatever of doing so. I got the im pression that the barque I saw in my dream was coming to rescue us; but how that impression came I cannot tell. There is another very strange thing about it/' he added. " Everything here on board seems to me quite familiar; yet I am very sure I never was in your vessel before. It is all a puzzle to me. What did your mate see?" Thereupon Mr. Bruce related to them all the circumstances above detailed. The conclusion they finally arrived at was, that it was a special interposi tion of Providence to save them from what seemed a hopeless fate. The above narrative was communi crated to me by Captain J. S. Clarke, of the schooner Julia Hallock, who had it directly from Mr, Bruce himself. They sailed together for seventeen months, in the year 1836 and 1837; so that Captain Clarke had the story from the mate eight years after the occurrence. He has since lost sight of him, and does not know whether be is alive il he Had heard of him since they were shipmates is, that he continued to trade to New Brunswick, that «he became the master of the brig Comet, and that she was lost, I asked Captain Clarke if be knew Bruce well, and what sort of a man* he was.
