MOEE OF "WILLIAMS" IN SYDNEY. When he first arrived in Sydney he was " taken np" by a friend who originally came from the same part of England. The latter took him to a boarding-house at Middle-street, Chippendale, kept by a highly respectable widow. The friend found employment for " Williams " at Tooth's Brewery ; but this position he did not hold long, as he quarrelled with his superior. He afterward opened up a little business in Castlereagh-street, which abruptly ended with his arrest for theft, and a sentence of six months' imprisonment followed. While residing with the widow he was always talking of his " dear wife, Marion," who he said was in England, and for whose companionship he . longed. This lady arrived in Sydney while " Wilhams " was in prison. He was accustomed to sleep with Marion's photo- graph beneath his pillow. He was remarked , for his consistency in attending St. Paul's Church. The widow was eventually obliged to get rid of " Wilhams," on account of his mysterious manner, and particularly for his whining complainings that " a ghost haunted bis room at night time." On one occasion he rushed down stairs to the room where hiB landlady was, and, in a state of real or acted terror, said that he was intercepted on the stairway by "the ghost."
