MAN'S RIGHTS AND DUTIES. IMPORTANT SERMON BY THE REV. ISAAC MOORE. A sermon in aid of the Society of the Little Sisters of the Poor was preached in St Francis s Church, by the Rev Isaac Moore, S J , yesterday morning. There was a large attendance. The Rev ISAAC MOORE took for his text the words, "'Thou openest Th> bund and fullest every living creature with blessing, Psalms 144, 10 He said, -Surely the inspired hard who wrote these words in jo) one and triumphant He exults in the Lord whose glories he sings His heart is full of gratitude and joy, and he calls to his aid the language of poetry and thousand) of verse to give utterance to the swelling thoughts that rise in his bosom, when before his Bpmtual gaze there passes a vision of the mere, the generosity) towards man towards every living creature, of the great Creator Nor, though the language in poetic does it in aught exceed the strictest limit of truth For he is writing under the impulse of the Holy Ghost He is inspired He therefore will say only what God, the author of truth, wills that he shall say, not more not less and in words that convey accurately the truth God pleases to disclose All this we know But before we can grasp the truth revealed and share the JO), the exultation of the inspired writer, we must take into our consideration the startling fact that even for the fulfilment of His most benevolent purposes. God has been pleased to make himself dependent on the co-operation of roan Furthermore, that by endowing man with free will He has called into existence a power able to thwart His most merciful designs This may seem a soul astounding paradox, yet is it in reality the very truth Nay, even a simple obvious truth Science can tell of the vast and mighty forces that have been at work, that are still at work, to make this earth suited to be a dwelling place for men Their action can be traced, and the combination of their action from the minutest organism that exists in earth, or air, or water to the highest range of being of which the human mind has knowledge But mighty as is their force, unlimited apparently their power, the purpose of God that the world He created shall be a dwelling place for man, the creature He so loved, in which he may find all that is suited to maintain and adorn his existence and satisfy) all the play sical, intellectual wants of his being without many cooperation must remain unfulfilled The light, the heat, the moisture are there the fertilising juices of the soil are read), but unless man shall plant and sow and till in vain the sun will shine in vain the rivers will flow in vain the rain will fall, and the glorious rays of heat and light, the unseen subtle action of magnetism and electricity put forth their power all in vain Until the intellect of man employ its ingenuity to utilise the force God has placed at his disposition, and the hand of man put forth its strength to labour, no golden harvests will wave and glitter in the sun, no bread that strengthens, no " wine that maketh glad the heart, no luscious fruits that delight the beholder will Read the eye till culture has been added to natural productiveness Their nature seems to smile, and earth's bosom teems with grain, and fruit, and flowers, sweet messages of love from the great Creator to soften down the austerity of life and beautify man's existence It is when man to operates with his Creator that the full measure of the Maker s bounty is seen Then only can it be understood how limitless are the gifts to man Omma subjects neither eats All things hast Thou made subject to him the bodily strength of man is not great but the resources of his mind are boundless and in the vast storehouse of nature ready at hand he treasures of every) sort, multitudinous, and various, and count least as are the desires even of the most covetous and capricious All this is manifest, no arguments are needed to prove it God indeed " hath opened His hand and has filled every creature with blessings Yet still does it remain true that all has been done in vain it man withhold his co-operation As without that not even the food needed to support life can be obtained the strongest impulses of his nature therefore prompt man to utilise the gifts within him and around him to satisfy the complex wants of his being And all the earth and the riches thereof are given, not to any set of individuals but to all in common Man alone of all living creatures has reason he alone foresees the future The other living creatures possess in common with man the right to use the various products of nature to support their existence this the) use to provide for their daily wants without thought of the morrow incapable of self direction, they are guided by two in stincts sell preservation and the continuance of the species These instincts impel to things at hand They are moved to action by things that act on the senses Beyond these the brute creation cannot go These rights therefore, do not extend beyond the appropriation to themselves of what perishes in the use but which suffices to satisfy all the wants of their nature But how different is the condition of man He, too, is influenced and impelled by the two instincts which absolutely rule the brute creation for he, too, is an animal and possesses animality in the highest degree, his senses being stimulated by his imagination 'to make his own therefore, of what will satisfy his daily) wants he shares the right common to the brute creation But his foresight enables him to foresee that these wants will recur Thus his future wants are to him as present, and to provide for them also is clearly) his right I his he cannot do if he have a right to ma! e his own to appropriate, merci) such of the earths productions as perish in the use That he may have these when he will he must have the right to appropriate to himself the source whence, and whence alone all that satisfies human wants is derived name I), a portion of the earth, surface Hence the right to property in land, a right sacred, founded in human nature itself A right to have, without immediate exertion for that special purpose, not merely what supports his animal life, but also what will s satisfy that portion of his being which he does not share with mere moral, a right to have what will satisfy the social, intellectual and moral wants of his nature Now, this right is shared equally by all Every human creature, by the mere fact that he is man, possesses this right It is inalienable, and no state decree no human law, no human power can deprive man of that light in the Gospels and Epistles there are doubtless certain incitements and exhortations to the state of celibacy , but they are only counsels the) are not precepts Every man, therefore, remains free to become a husband and parent On the parent lies the imperative e duty to provide for the wants of his offspring for all their wants, social, intellectual and moral That right of property which we have seen is the sacred inalienable right of every man considered as an individual, must belong to him with extended force as head of a family For in no other way than by the possession of a prout give tug property, which he may transmit to his children, can he enable them with certainty to maintain them selves honourably, and guarantee them against want and misery amid the uncertainties of this life lins right, therefore to acquire and hold property is absolutely inseparable from nature And all men possess it and possess it an equal share in all men do not possess equal qualities for putting that right in force Some are stronger than others some more ingenious than others some more prudent and thrifty) than others hence, when the exercise of this right has been going on for centuries some will be found to have much some very little, some nothing 1 es, beyond all doubt some will be found to have nothing Such the unanimous teaching of past history, tells us must be the result Such the teaching of the Gospel, ' The poor you will have always with you How is this to be reconciled with the words of the text s"He hath opened his hand and filled with blessing every living creature 1 firstly the right to appropriate what was originally in common, though a sacred right must be exercised within such limits as not to defeat the very purposes for which it exists And these limits it is for each individual state to me But even when all thathaabeencnrefullydone thewholeland of the country will be possessed by a number, small perhaps compared with the whole population Again the right to possess does not give the power to make productive Labour alone can do that Well, when wages full) adequate and completely just are paid by those who held the soil to those who make the soil productive that fund will supply them not merely with what is required for the support of animal life but, more over when just with what is justly demanded by the requirements of a social, intellectual and moral being And every effort to deprive the mot all this profane) portion of this is a crime crying to God for vengeance When wages justly proportioned to the labour are p m thin the labourer, too, has wherewithal he may maintain himself in frugal comfort AT last the amount in money may be must depend 1 on places and circumstances and times but wherever and when ever the labourer expends his strength for the benefit of an employer his remuneration must be such as to maintain him in frugal comfort Thus the wants of his being will be satisfied and are by the Almighty provide for So in this case, also, He hath opened his hand and filled every creature with blessings But here also, the fulfil most of the Creator's benign purpose may be thwarted by the wickedness of man Now, wise and just laws regulating the relations between employers and employed may do much to check and control the grasping greed of unjust capitalists and employers, and all that can be done should be done But there are many crimes of fraud and guilt by which the powerful can cheat the poor, which no human law can reach by which the benign purposes of the Creator may be defeated. But not with impunity. For to cheat the labourer of his wages is a came crying to Heaven for vengeance. The. reverend gentleman concluded with a spirited appeal on behalf of the Little Sisters of the Poor, whose charitable deeds are done thoroughly and unostentatiously.
