POETRY, To Lay the Ghost, You say you've a ghost that hauntB you, The ghost of a vain regret, The thought of the years you have wasted, And would, if you oould, forgot. Your heart overflows with sorrow As yon think of tbe misspent Fast, Opportunities lost for ever Crowd memory thick and fast. But all your vain ragrettiogs Will never lay the ghost Which makes us, tach one, at some time, His most unwilling host. For the only way to do it Ib to rise to a better life, To build up the old waste places, To stut on a holy strife. To conquer yonr lower nature, To crucify Self, and to live, Henceforth, to a nobler purpose, Yonr time and your strength to give. Oh, live as a man and a Christian, And you shall have pece at the last. Aud yonr deathbed shall not be haunted By the ghoBt of a misspent Fast.
