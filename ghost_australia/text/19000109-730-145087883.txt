' mismanagement,' for, to giv» the devil his due, unforeseen circumstanpes over which the .Committee had no control militated against tho success of the club. I take, it that the real causo of *he trouble' is the very half-hearted support accorded tbe' club by .business people and the public generally. This to me seetns a very suicidal policy. A successful race, meeting means, the circulation of a con siderable amount of cash. \- . ?.???? . Every horse, jockey, owner, and visitor (from tbe country^ or neighbouring centres .of population')! must spend, or cause to be. spent, a certain sum of money, ft oin which' we all, directly br indirectly, receive soujb benefit — much »r little, as the c»se m.\y be.

V* - -? Now, the question is all in a^nutshell, and lnoking at it from a conimousunse. point of view, it does seem to me that by supporting the Race Club we are - looking after the best interests of the town. And . I say this with all due respect to a larga number of worthy townspeople who object t» racing on principle. But tho ' sport of kinjjs' will live as long as there is euoutrh oxygen on the earth to kee'p life in the inhabitants. ?-' - ? _J^ ; - _'''' A meetinj is to be held to-night of .all interested in racing-, and more especially in the fortunes of the West* Wyildiig Racing Club.
