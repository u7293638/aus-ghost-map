BURROWA. from a correspondent. March 1. â€” On Friday last Mr. M. Mullaiy mot with an accident whilo out riding. Whonnp- pronching tho cricket ground at a tolorably fast paco, his hoi-bo placed his foot in a deep hole, stumblod, nnd rolled ovor, casting tho rider to mother earth with great violenco. When picked up ho was unconscious, and it was found that his faco and hond woro much bruised aud cut, ospocially about tho mouth, but no bones wero brokon. He ivas at once removed to his resi dence, and has sinco boon undor tho cat-o of Dr. Garry, with satisfactory rosults. The horse was so much injurod that it bocamo necessary to de stroy him on Saturday. A man named Cat- mody was thrown from hiB horse to-day, nnd had hi3 collar bono brokon. Surgical assistance was promptly obtaiiiod, but I have not heard how tho rann is progressing. Tho cricket match on Saturday botwoon Yass aud Burrowa had a difforont termination to what was gonornlly anticipated. _ As tho Burrowa beam only commenced practice on Wednesday, it was thought that thoir chancos of winning Avore vra-y small, more especially as it was roporbod thnt tho Yass toain was vory strong, nnd had a good share of practice. Tho defeat, however, of tho lattor toam was unmistakable, they had not tho "ghost of a chanco," and it ought to touch them a lesson. The Electric Minstrels performed here on Wednesday ovoniug, hut attracted a vory meagro attendance.
