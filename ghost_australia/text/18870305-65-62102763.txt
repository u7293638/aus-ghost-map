Dino's head dropped upon his hands. ?"./Were all bis efforts vain to freo himself ' from the burdon of a wealth which ho did not desire ? _ Tho Prior of San Stofano had forced him into tho position of a claimant to the estate. "With his long-formed habits of obedience it seemed impossible to gainsay the Prior's will. Hero, in England it was casior. And Dino was moro and moro resolved to take his own way. A letter was brought to him at that moment. He opened it, and let Ilia eyes run mechanically down tho sheet. Then ho etavtcd violently, and read it again with moro attention. It contained ono sentence nod u signature : "If Dino Vnsari, of San Stefano, wilL visit mo nt Nethorglen, I will hoar what ho .. lins to say. MABOABET LUTTRELL.", , . ".: ; Could ho havo, expectod more ? , And yet . ^to his excited funcy, tho words seemed cold1 and hard. ?"' j CHAPTER XXXI.-Acci'SEK AND ACCCSED. THEKE lad been solemn council in the house of Netherglen. Mrs. Luttrell and Mr. Col- quhoun had held long interviews ; letters and papers of all sorts had been produced and compared; the dressing-room door was closed against all coiners, nnd even Angela was excluded,"1.-Hugo wag once summoned, and came away from tho conference with the ail of a desperate mun, nt once baffled and fierce. Ho lurked about thc dark corners of thc house, ns if ho were afraid to appear in thc light of the day; but betook no one into hie confidence)'' -Fortune,'character, lifo itself perhaps, seemed to lum to bc hanging on a thread. For, if Dino Vasar! remembered his treachery and exposed ' ir, ho knew that he should bo ruined and disgraced. And .he was resolved not to survive any such public expoBuro. He would die by his own hand, , rather than stand in, thc dock as a would-be murderer!!' "** '1 J"'\ Even jf thingajwere not so bad ns that, ho did not seo how ho was to exonerate himself from another charge ;-' a-minor one, indeed, but one which might make him look very black in some people's eyes. Ile had knowr of Dino's claims for many weeks, ns well ni of . Brinn's existence, why lind be-told.uc onè of his'discoVeries ? "Wont if Dino spok< of the tißsue of-lies which ho had concocted thecforgery, of^Brjan's^bandwrjting, in thc interne w 'which'they had" lind In' Tarragon street? Fortunately Dino had burned thc lotter, ¡and tlioro had . been ;np auditor bf thc conversation. Of course Tie must deny thal he had known anything of the matter. j Dine could provo nothing against him j he; could only make assertions.' ' But assertions were awkward things sometimes. J So Hugoskulked and frowned and listened, and'wastold'nothing'definite ; but saw bj the light of previous knowledge thnt 'therc was groat excitement in tljo bosoms of hie aunt and tho' family'lnwyer. Thoroi were letters nnd telegrams sent off, and Hugo wat disgusted to find that he could not S catch sight' of- their 'addresses? much* Jess of¡ their contents. Mr, Colquhoun looked gloomy; Mrs.'Luttrell sternly 'exultant. "What,-was going _on? Was Brian coming home ? or was Dino tojbe rocogniBcd in Bnon's^ilace? Hugo knew nothing."

" You'll, have to learn to call him hy auother name, if lie stays rfc. this houso young man," ho said. : " Ho (Iodines to bo called Brinn - ho Ima that much good sonso - but it scorns that Dino is short for Bernardino, or Bomo such-mouthful, and we're to call him Ber nani to avoid confusion.

Bu the assurance did not carry tho consolatioi to Hugo's mind which Mr. Colquhoun intended. Tho two lawyers drove away to Dunmui together. Hugo watched tiio red lamps o the dogcart down the road, mid then turnei away from the window with a guawinj sense of anxiety, which grow more imped ons every moment. He felt that he must di something to relieve it. Ho knew where tin interview with Dino was taking place. Mr Luttrell had lately been growing soincwhn infirm ; a slight stroke of paralysis, dauger ouB only in that it was probably the pre cursor of other attacks, had rendered loco .motion'particularly, distasteful to her. Sin did not like to feel that she was dopenden upon otherS'for aid, and therefore sat usual!; in a. wheeled chair in ,her dressing-room, nu( it was the most easily accessible room fron her sleeping ? apartment. She was in he dressing-room., now, f and Dino . Vasari _ wa with her.* '" Hugo stolet quietly through tho passage until he reached tho door of Mrs. Luttrell': bedroom, which was ajar.

"But you , say this to tensó me only ; being a Luttrell-^rthe only .Luttrell, indeed, save Hugo, that remains you must marry and continuó the family" "I shall never marry,"¡said Dino, with a firmness which nt Inst seemed to make an impression upon Mrs, Luttrell, " because I amj-oing to ho a monk." ' Hugo could not stifle a quick catching of his breath. Did Dino mean what ho said ? And 'What effect would this decision have upon tho lives of tho many persons whose future seemed to bo bound up with his? "What would Mrs. Luttrell say ? ? At first sho said nothing. And then Dino's voice wns heard again. " Mother, my mother, do not look at me Uko that. I must follow my vocation. I would, have given myself years ago, but I was not allowed. The Prior will receive me now. And nothing on earth will turn me from my 'resolution. I have made up my mind." " "What !" said Mrs. Luttrell, very slowly. "You will desert mo too, after all these years !" , Dino answered by repeating in Latin the words-" Ho that loveth fnther or mother more tbnn nie, ia not worthy of me." But Mrs. Luttrell interrupted him angrily. " I wnnt nono of your Latin gibberish," she said. " I want plain common Bcnse. If you go into a monastery, do you intend to give tho property to tho monks ? Porhnps you want to turn Netherglen into a convent, and establish a Priory at Strathleckio ? Well, I cannot prevent you. "What fools wo nre to think that there is any happin neBB in this world 1" " Mother !" said Dino, and his .voico was very gentle, " lot mo speak to you of another before ive talk about the estates. Let me speak to rou of Brian." " Brinn !" Her Toicc had a checked tone for a moment ; then sho recovered herself and spoke in her usual harsh way. " I know no one of that name but you." " I mean my friend whom you thought to be your son for so ninny years, mother. Hnve you no tenderness for him? Do you not think of him with a little love and pity? Let me tell you what he suffered. "When he came to us first at San Stefano he wns nearly dying of grief. It was long before we nursed him back to health. When I think how we nil learnt to love him, mother, I cannot but believe that you must love him too." " I never loved him," said Mrs» Luttrell. " He stood in your place. If you had a spark of proper pndo in you, you would know that he «as your enemy, and you will feel towards him as I do." / " He is nn enemy that I have learned to love," answered Dino.

" -. t , - " Because I mean him to'fill my place." There was a little Bilence, in which the fnll of a cinder from tho grnte could bo disr tinctly heard. Then Mrs. Luttrell uttered a long, low monn. " Oh, my God IV' she said. ""What have I done thnt I'should ,be tor- mented in this way ?" '..'.'?!. , "Mother, mother, do not say so," said Dino, evidently with deep_ emotion.

"Db you know what manner of man. this Hugo. Luttrell is, that you WÍBII to enrich him with your wealth, and make him tho master'of Nothorglon?'' "I know no harm of him," sho answered. He passed a little, and turned his face wns it consciously or unconsciously ? - towards thc open door, from which could bo seen the screen, behind which the unhnppy listener crouched and quivered in agony of fear. Willingly would Hugo have turned and fled, but flight was now inpossible. The fire wars blnzing brightly, and throw a red glow over all the room. If he emerged from behind the screen, his figure would be distinctly visible to Dino, whose fnce wns turned in that direction. Whnt was he going to say ? . .. .f I know no harm of him,'' sho answered.. ' Then I will enlighten you. Hugo Lut-, trell know that Brinn was alive, that I was in England, two months ago.

Mrs. Luttroll's voice, harsh and, strident with emotion, against which she did her best tb fight, broke the sudden silence. " Do you call it fair and right," she said, " to accuBO a man of such faults ns these behind his bnck ? If you want to toll me anything against Hugo, send for him and tell it to me in his presence. Then he can defend himself." " Ho will try to defend himself, no doubt," anïrl Tl!rm with n Tinto nf mnlancholv scorn in his grave, young voice. " But I will do nothing behind his back. You wish him to be summoned ?" , " Yes, I do. Bing the bell instantly !" cried Mrs. Luttrell, whose loving ardour seemed to have given way to the most un- mitigated resentment. " Tell the servants to find him and bring him here." '' They would not have far to go," said Dino coolly. " Ho is close to hand. Hugo J Luttrell, come hero and answer for yourself." " What do you mean ? Where is he ?" exclaimed Mrs. Luttrell, struck with his tono of command. " Ho is not in this room !" " No, but he is in the next, hiding behind that Hereon. He has been there for tho last half-hour. You need play the spy no longer, sir. Have tho goodness to step forward and show yourself." The inexorable sternness of his voice struck tho listeners with amaze. . Pale as a ghost, trembling Iiko au aspen leaf, Hugo emerged from his hiding-place, and con- fronted the mother and tho son.
