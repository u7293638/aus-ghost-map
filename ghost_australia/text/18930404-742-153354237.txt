WESLEYAN CHUBOH. The service on Sunday morning was con ducted at the Patterson-street Chuich by the Bev. J. G. Wheen, who preached on tbe subj-.ct of the day, 14 The resurrection of Christ.' The rev. gentleman took bis text from the Cth copter of tbe Acta of the Apostles, 30th, 31st, and 32nd verses— 'The God of our fathers laised up Jesus, Whom ye Blew and hanged on tbe tree. Him hath God exalted with his light hind to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we . are His witnesses of these things ; and so is also tbe Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey Him.' The prcacbersaid that in connection with tbe end of Christ's ministry i here were three great facts — His death, His burial, and His resurrection. He then proceeded to show the indisputability of these facts. First, by the testimony of the four evangelists, who, although they in various places record events peculiar to themselves, but on these three points agree unanimcusly ; then, by the prophecies and the predictions of Christ Himself ; then the testimony of Mary Magdalene and the others who visited the empty sepulchre, and those who were visited by Him after His resurrec tion. The rev. gentleman then asked, If the death end resurrection of Christ be all fiction, how can we account for tbe rise and extent of the Christian Church ? He then showed that God Himself had declared that Jesus was His Son by raising Him ; and Christ Himself declared His Sonship by calling God His Father. The choir, under the leadership of Mr W. F. Cato, very creditably sang an appro priate . selection whilst the collection was being taken up, Mrs Tribe presiding at the organ.
