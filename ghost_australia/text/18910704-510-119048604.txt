The next day found me in the train on my way to Hazeldene Hall. Even ing set in so quickly I was unable to see anything of the country through which we passed. I wondered if I should find young Harcourt much changed. His pretty little sister would have grown into a woman. Teu years makes a consider able diflerence in a girl's life ! The arrival of the train at Conynrs cut short my reflections. Jack Harcourt was waiting fqr me on the platform. ' How are you, Harrington, old fel low f he exclaimed, wringing my hand.

W,o. could see the lights from the house gleaming between the trees in the long, d£.rk avenue — welcome 3ight to a cold aiid^veary traveller. ' Not bad going,' said Jack,, as he sprang out, and looked at his watch ; ' she 'has done her six miles under the half-hour, and I was holding her in .all the time. Jump out, old fellow ! I suspect the cold touches you up a bit. You Anglo-Indians are not usnd to this kind of weather,' I muttered something about. not being VHry cold, but I am afraid my looks belied my words. Our arrival was evidently expected, the hall door being thrown open by the butler direotly the dog-cart drove up, and that functionary ushered us up stairs into a comfortoble though rather suiail drawing-room. Mr. Harcourt came forward to meet ine, and shook me cordially by the hand. He was a fine specimen of the coun try acquire, genial and hearty. After presenting me to his wife, a well-preserved woman, about fiveand forty, he went to the dour of the ad ioining room, and c;ilied, ' Alice ! ' A clsar, sweet voice replied, ' Yes, father 1 ' and 'Miss Harcuurt enterad ini; niiiiii. Couid this possibly h?. Jack's little school-girl sister ? The pretty sylph like child had developed into a lovely woman, about the middle height, with a supple rounded figure, and graceful, self-possessed manner. Masses of g-.)lden hair clustered over a broad, low brow. Her eyes were her chief bsauty-^eep, dork-blue eyes, fringed with long black lashes, and straight pencilied brows many shades darker than her hair ; eyes that had a dreamy, half-melancholy look in thein but met your own with a clear, stead fast gaze, that seemed to reflect their owner's character. The general expression of the face was singularly sweet. She cams forward and hold opt her hand, with a quiet smile. 'Welcome to England, Captain Harrington ! ' ' Jack tells me that you and Alice are old friends ; ' said Mr. Harcourt. 'Yes,' replied Alice; 'our acquuin tance dates bock to my school days, when Jack took me for walks on half holidays, ani he and Captain Harring ton used to send me back to school laden with bonbons.' ' You wonld hardly know my little girl again, would you, Harrington ? ' said Mr. Harcourt, looking fondly at his daughter. Alice flushed, and changed the con versation. ' Ring the bell, Jack please. Cap tain Harrington will be glad of some tea after his railway journey. Would you prefer sherry and bitters or brandy and soda V ' No, thanks, I will accept Miss Har court's offer of some tea.' ' You must find this weather 'a 'great change after India ? ' said Mis,. Har court, kindly, making room for -me on the sofa. 'I certainly do feel the cold a good deal, but I have no doubt I shall soon get acclimatized.' ' What made you all emigrate into the blue drawing-roonj, mother? in quired Jack. ' Alice thought Captain Harrington woulfl find iff more cosy. The large, drawing-room is cold and. dreary unless well lighted and- filled with company. I call it the most uncomfortable room in the house.' ^ 'Quite, true, my clear,' chimed in, Mr. Harcourt. 'I hope you have had a g-*pd fire lighted'in Captain' Harring ton's room?' - t. ?'' : ??-.?.

' I shall have to caution them. I hope you do not put any faith in ghost stories, Caprain Har rington f ♦Oh, dear, no, Mrs. Harcourt.; make your mind quite easy on that point. I haven't the slightest objec tion to sleep in any haunted room whatever.' 'I thought not. It is only the thcrough fools that are superstitious as a general rule. Jack, my dear, show Captain Harrington his raoin. We di ne at 8 o'clock'.' 'I followed Jack up the fine oak stair- case across the lobby, at the fur ther end of which was a green baize door. ' This leads to the old wing, and a deuced long way off it is, too, as I know to my cost after a hard day's hunting,' Jack said. We passed through a long, dark passage, very lrapertoctly iigiited, which branched off iato a corridor. 'That is Alice's room,' said my guifle, pointing to the first door we came to. ' She has had to turn out of her room for her . cousins. Mine is *next to it, and yours just beyond, iat, the further end.' We reached it at last, and Jack threw open the^lodr. A bright fire shed a cheerful light around, and everything had been done to impart a cosy appearance to the room. The roof was low, like that of old fashioned houses, and the ivy ha 1 grown t lickly round the window. One or two heavy tendrils swept over the panes of gloss. ' I hope you will be comfortable,' said Jack.. 'It is hard lines you should have such a tramp, but that confounded bricklayer has taken a month .to put the lower rooms in order, and there are only three fin ished yet.' On my re-appearance in the draw ing room, I found the family assembled waiting the announcement of dinner, and I was introduced to Jack's cousins, the Misses Mayburn. The elder was a tall, fair-haired girl, very ordinary looking; the younger, Jessie, was red-haired and freckled, but there was something very chic about the sunny little face, and she had plenty to say for herself. She and Jack were going through a cross-tirjs of chaff, the young lady evi dently getting the best of it. The evening passed very pleasantly. We had music nnd singing : the cou sins both played well, and Alice sang one or two simple English ballads. Though not powerful, her voice ^as clear and swoet, and she sang with feeling and expression. It was one of those sympathetic voices which seem to thrill through your heart. Mine .was fast becoming hopelessly jen thrailed. 9 ' After the ladies had retired for jthe night, Jack and I retired to the smoking-room^ where we sat smoking and chatting until the clock struck twelve, when J^ck proposed that: we should turu in. ' ; 'We keep early hours in this estab lishment,' said he. i 'You don't call twelve o'clock par ticularly earlyi do you ?' j 'Well, it certainly jsn't^ late. | A Londoner -would consider^ it^ust opm meticing the evening ; but we are ' all of the woridfi ^|r^anfoundedly colS it &1 Ihdjj^ yi-ur fire baa riot burnt ghosts trouble jyou^fiing out to me j I wiUjcoiinei tqi.tWjpescue.'r ' M 'iscM-n Asi 3pck left the room I locked the doo'iyand had a- good jlook round. Yes, there was a weird, un canny air abojta it. The wind Had risen, and Was moaning among the tress, now rising to a perfect shriek, then dying away in fitful sobs. I noticed for the first time that there was another door leading out of my room, which stood open, «nd tak ing up my candle I proceeded to ex plore. * The room found had evidently been ft lady's. boudoir at some remote period. The furniture was of the most anti quated description, and apparently long unused. A few modern articles in the shape of a writing-table and one or two chairs had bean added, with the view of converting it into a temporary writ ing room. . * I turned round rather sharply. Was it my fancy, or- the outline of a man's figure that darkened the window for an instunt, and then disappeared 1 ' It must have Wen purely imagina tion,' I thought to myself. ' If I had heard- nothing about a ghost, the idea would never have entered nfy head.' 7* At this instant I was fairly startled by a deep, long-drawn sigh as if from a heart over-charged. with sorrow. Again I looked round, but nothing was visible. ' It is all a hoax !' I exclaimed angrily. ' Jack and his cousins are trying to take a rise out of me.' I returned to my room and, undress ing myself, repliuished the fire, and, drawing an iirm-chair up to it, I fell into a brown study, until, being tho roughly tired, gradually sleep overtook hip. How long I slept T can't say ; but I was suddenly awoke by the clasp of a woman's hand. The small soft fingers clung to mine, but they were cold as the fing-srs of the. dead. , At the same instant a pair of icy lips pressed my brow for a moment. This is too much !' I cried, springing to my feet. ' I will find out who is playing me these tricks.' I glanced round the room. The candles had burnt down almost to their socket3. The fire, too, was nearly out, and cast a flickering light on the gloomy room. But I could see I was alone. I walked rapidly to the door. It was locked on the inside. But that my whole frame still thrilled with the touch of that cold little hand and thoseicy Iip3, IshoulJ have persuaded myself that the thing was a dream. Sorely puzzled and perplexed, I tried to reason the matter out. A trick it could hardly be ; my tormentor could not have disappeared bodily in a mo ment, and through a door which 1 found locked in the inside. On the other hand, I could not bring myself to believe that there was anything supernatural in the matter. At last I came to the conclusion that it was some cleverly-contrived trick. What was more probable than the old house, abounding in secret doors and rooms, the knowledge of which Jack and his cousins had turned to their amusement, and my discomfi ture? Thus reassuring myself, I turned into bed, and soon fell asleep ; nor did I awake until the servant knocked at my door next morning with my hot water. I determined to say nothing about my adventure. I knew I should only get unmercifully chaffed. Moreover, I was turning over in my head sundry schemes of vengeance by which I hoped to turn the tables on my tormentors. I descended to the breakfast-room with a beaming countenance, and in answer to Mrs. Harcourt's hospitable ? inquiry as . to how I had passed the night, I replied that I had slept like a top (which was true of the latter por tion of it.) ' ? And you saw nothing of the ghost, Captain Harrington ?' asked Miss Jessie Mayburn. ' Nothing half so low.' ' But did you hear anything V said Jackj-with a twinkle in his eye. A ?

I have a profound veneration ^ for my beloved aunt, and lam awfully fond of Ah'ce — honor bright (seeing the Somewhat incredulous look on my face) ; but T must -admit, with a due regard for veracity, that they are not the most lively companions in the world.' I glanced from my rattle-brained neighbour to the fair, pensive face op posite me. No ; perhaps she was not either brilliant or lively, but what man could desire a sweeter, fairer companion for 1 if e ? To me there seemed as great a contrast between the two girls us there is between a sunflower .und a lily-of the-valley. « ' I ' have asked Percival to shoot with us this morning, my dear,' said Mr. Harcourt to his wife, 'and he will probably return to dinner.' ' Oh, that will be delightful !' ex claimed Miss Mayburn. 'He it such an entertaining man, and tells such amusing stories.' 'Chiefly at the expense of some ? friend or acquaintance,' said Alice, quietly. ' I can't think why you dislike him, Alice. I am sure he is extremely nine and good-natured, and he admires you awfully ; he told me as much.' ' I am afraid, Tilly, the admiration is not mutual. I wish he would take^| a fancy to me instead,' said, MjaH Jessie. ' Don't look so shocked, Alice.^( See what a good all round mnh he is, a splendid lawn tennis player,/ a first rate billiard player, a crack' shot, a ' My dear Jessie, spare me, I entreat you, a further catalogue of Mr. Per cival's accomplishments.' ' Who is this Admirable Crichton V I ventured to enquire. ' He is a neighbour of ours, who has just come into an estate next to the Hall,' said Jack. ' Fercival is not half a bad fellow, and as Jessie remarked, he is a good all round man. But it is time we got into our shooting coats. Harrington, or we shall keep the gov ernor waiting,' Whether my last night's adventure had unstrung my nerves, or Mr. Per cival's presence acted as an irritant, fC can't say, but I missed shot after snot. Birds rose on all sides of me, hut 1 hardly one could I hit. My ill-humor was not improved when we came to compare bags and Mr. Percival pro duced fifteen bface to my five or six. Miss Jessie, in her usual outspoken way, remarked, ' Is that all you have contributed, Captain Harrington ? I thought you Indian officers wee great ; sportsmen.' - ] ' Captain Harrington looks down on our small game. Tigers and elephants ] are more in his line,' said Mr. Percival _] with a palpable sneer.
