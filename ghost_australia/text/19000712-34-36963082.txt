AMUSEMENTS THEATRE ROYAL. Owing to the extraordinry success at- tending the performance of "What Hap- <*> pened to Jones?" the Theatre Royal not being large enough to accommodate "Jones's" patrons, the management has decided upon giving a matinee performance of their excruciatingly fuuny farce-comedy next Saturday afternoon. "The Professor's Love Story" is billed for next Tuesday, and his Excellency the Governor has inti- mated his intention of being present to witness the initial peformance in Ade- laide of J. M. Barrie's delightful comedy. \------------------------- The Glenelg Town Hall was packed to the doors on Tuesday evening, when a benefit concert was tendered to a local widow, who has five children and is in poor circumstances. The Mascotta Speciality Company provided the pro- gramme, every item of which was well re- ceived Messrs J. Ward and J. Earle (bones), W. Goodger and J. Ward (tam- bos), and C. Waite (conversationalist), rendered the "business" of the minstrel show, and with the assistance of the Eugene Sisters, Misses Angelita Davis and L. Jarman and Messrs. Don Fraser and Roy Murphy were responsible for the first half of a very interesting programme. The same performers contributed special items later in the evening; Messrs. Jack Ward and Don Fraser, with the Eugene Sisters, and Mr. Charles Waite meeting with great suc- cess. The Murphy Brothers again demon- strated their abilities as trick and bur- lesque bicycle riders. The programme ter- minated with an amusing farce, entitled "The Ghost in a Pawnshop," in which the characters were sustained by Messrs. Don Fraser, J. Ward, and W. Goodger.
