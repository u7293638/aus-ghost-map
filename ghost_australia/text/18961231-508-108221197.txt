M'Gratli-fiUDDorted.- the loft' division. '- .v ,, ; . ' [ 'You're.' .looking a litQe.'paie this eyeningi Mrs. Forrester,' said he. ... 'Nothing the inat ror. I hope?' You're not feeling seedy?' 'A; liver attafck,' she replied '.with her.cus-, toniary bhiiitness. 'Not 'very serious, only] requires .plenty of fresh air 'and 'exercise. One r,ejts fat and lazy in the summer. Bythe bye,' Mies Browser, that^was- a 'nice Useful looking nag you were ruling to-day. Not se sbowyj perhaps, ; as tiie chestnut, but with idpital good points, and looks like a wearand tear sort of customer.' 'You've described him' to a nicety,' said Kate in reply. 'The Duckling is & stout, honest little beast, never sick or sorry, but un til he gets, excited inclined to take life almost tco easily. He lacks the, chestnut's dash.' 'Have you everriddenTiim wifli a spur?' ?*No, I can't say that, i- baye. ,.To ;Jf H- the truth, '-I feel somewhat' a&aid; of applying it iiiiiiseriiminately.' ?-'.-.?'?'? ? ? '.Oh, no, you wouldn't.'' You: take my adr vice, and ride him with one, if only for a time or two. v i'he least touch is often sufficient to rouse a sluggish horse. They are apt to get cunning when ridden by ladies, and an occa sional reminder does them all the good in the Tvorld. I know many people object to a one sided spur, and say it's worse than useless, but my experience is exactly the reverse. I consider it a most valuable auxiliary, espe cially with a certain class of animal.' 'Faith !and a better authority does not exist in the whole of Great Britain,' interposed Mr. M'Grath, looking round the table with an ex pression of conviction which seemed to eay, 'There! I defy any one to contradict that statement;' - . 'Now, Terry, keep your national blarney for those who:,apprecia,te.it,' rjeturned.the old lady, vivaciously, 'and don't waste your soft sawder upon me. I'm too ancient for that sort of tiling, and past the Tmarket' 'Begad! bux its rale unkind that ye are, Mrs. Forrester, mavourneen,' exclaimed Mr. M'Grath, adopting the very strongest brogue. 'And a clever faymale like yerself can al ways command a market.' 'Thank you, my good friend ; you are ex ceedinglyr flattering, and were' I a young girl my head would be quite tarnea with such a complimentary speech.' \\- ? 'Share, Mrs. Forrester, ^and it ye were but a wee bit spalpeen, it would lie for trying to peisB^de ye to become Mrs. Terence M'Grath that I should aspire.' **Then it's lucky for you that I am nqjfc arid you are .deterred from committing so crown ing an act of folly,' retorted the old lady amidst a general roar of laughter. 'Your heart's too big for your body, Terry, and as for your 'tommon sense It is nowhere, so let us change the subject Jack,' turning to Colonel Clinker, 'I've got: something to tell you, something I was particularly requested by 4 fauvadmirer to consult you about. Are i yow all attention?' -Am I not always so when'' addressed by Mi& Forrester?' returned he gallantly. 'Who is fiie ' lady, and why does she seek;; advice froi&i; so incompetent a person?' *'; L great friend of yours, Lady Anne Bir keij , and she is mad about' getting iipa ladies' stex pieehase: You remember there was some tali of doing so last winter, only the project fel| to the ground through want of proper ba-: ting. But this yean it appears the old EaH has taken up the affair, *eon aniore,' and hasfsignified his intention of allowing the race to be run over ids land, provided some com petent person— yourself, for instance— will un dertake to choose a suitable course, and see that 'tie fences are not too large and danger ous. It won't do, he says, for the ladies to come to grief,. neither will he allow- the thing to Jbe made public in. any way, but if a few of .tie choose to get it up -among ourselves-, and can ensure some four or five starters, he will present a - handsome silver cup to the winner. Now, Lady Anne, when she heard you were coming liere to-night, particularly asked me to seek your opinion on this; mo mentous question, and engage, if possible, your active co-operation. In fact, she wants you to become the moving spirit, and take the whole thing^in hand from first to last' : 'Very kind of Lady Anne, I'm sure. But who and what is the field to consist of 'i Have you any notion ?' 'Why, there's Lady Anne herself. She's as keen as mustard about it, not that she will possess fiie ghost of a chance of winning, un less the Earlv outs Ms hand in his Docket and gives her a deeent mount. Miss Palliser,,too, is always game for .anything in- s-tne riding way.. Her ambjiious ^spirit would simply re vel in the excitement of a race. I lay any money that she jumps at the -idea.' . 'I wish the old scarecrow would jump off the hooks. Nasty spiteful creature! I hate the very sight of her out-iiunting. Well, jgo on,: who else?' * ^Then there are; Mrs. ?'. Piaget &nd; Mrs. Pbipps; perhaps one oritwo^&ers;^and'lastlyv with a little persuasion— myself.' ,. . , 'JYourself?' Capital! ?That' puts a. different complexion on the-mlafter altogether.

'I told- Lady Anne I felt al taost sure you 'would join our parry; besides, I1| would be a shame not to give that beiauti ful chestnut an opportunity^ of showing us all h* lieels. He ought to have an uncommonly goM chance of winning. Can he stay?' t Yes, I think so,' answered Kate, more placidly. ,! ? : , - 'iHave you heard what the distance is to be?' asked Colonel CUnker. VSo much de pends upon, that, especially with -untrained hoijses, generally as fat as so many bullocks. I should say a two to a two and a half miles course would be amply. sufficient . A. -longer onetwill only give 'rise to a variety, of mis liaTii T lav -h-Ti ' +/\ -'/vrna-T.a 'PolHcoip nnmcta in as bbwn as a Liverpool chaser;' - - 'Well, all such details: will jjrobably be left to yeu to decide,' said -Mrs. Forrester, 'Irfrty AmiA wants you. to go over thfe first day you can in order to settle '.preliminaries. . You know the 'big grass'' fields, within half a mile of the Castle? There was some talk of mak ing one of them the starting point But you will settle all that, since everything, is to be placed in .your hands.' L ..: . \- 'An\ exceedingly -invidious ;hbno^ pretty sure to call down on my devoted iead no end of abifee.' I never, knew the -man yet who undertook' -to make .out aT ^steeplechase, course and diq not come in for almost tlfiiversal con demnafion.- The riders consider -the obstacles too large, the public thinfc.ihem too email; the one fin^s Ifault with the -distance, the other complaitis*pf its brevity; and so they go on. It's imppssible to satisfy eVerybody, even un der the Vost favorable .conditions; but when it comes1 to pleasing half-a^ozen ladies, and providing both -for their safety and amuse ment, I confess to ebrmkingfrom-sueh a'diffi cult and! delicate undertaking. It ab^ady weighs ilpon my mind. . like 'an incubus. Imagine |tbe tremendous, responsibility ~of se lecting tte fences, when I T-''nir at each par ticular one that isome . ? frail-Umbed woman may coma to grief over it I don't fancy the job in the least and /nothing* but my friend ship for I4fly Anne wjouid induce iae to coun tenance' it|for one minute. However, since' you ladies appear resolved;'put me out of sus pense at once by telling me when the cele brated female ^FoxJngtoja steeplechase is likely to come off;' ? 'I won't have you speak of our purpose in that disparaging -manner,*' said. Mrs. Forrester reprovingly, i 'And I back the .ladies to ac quit themselves quite^ as creditably as if they were men. iNow, Jack. 4on't be Jdisagreeable, for if you begin by 'giving yourself airs and turning up jour Bpse^in' disdain the whole thing will collapse, and Lady Anne be terribly disappointed.'^ ; : , 'I should b-f sorry to disappoint her lady smp. awns a real gooa-son, ana i certamiy would go out bf my way to render her any little service that happened to be in my power. Has she fixed ib.e 'tunej?^' ' . .' - 'Oh, , dear, no¥ rIn fact the idea; nas only just been broached. ;.

T 'That is a *sine qua non.' I suppose yoii are .prepared to put the chestnut into regular 'work, Miss Brew-. 'Really,' said ece, 'I have hardly thought of it yet.
