Coleman's Frolios. â€¢ K u. 0 00 a UK. Jan 5. John Coleman, the well-known comedian, whose name is associated with the inimitable " Scarecrow Dance," was this morning charged at the Kalgoorlie Police Court with having threatened to kill Emile La/.ern, a member of the John Coleman's Frolics Company, no v touring the goldfn-lds. The complainant Lazern failed to put in an appearance, and the police stated that he had apparently left the district. Accused was consequently discharged without the case being entered into. [Yesterday we published a message j stating that Sage, the lessee of the Perth Theatre Ro)al, under engagement { with whom tlit> Frolics Company had come to the fields, had taken his de- i parture from the colony under circumstances which led to the issue of a warrant for his arrest under the Fraudulent Debtor^' Act. Apparently the ghost has not been walking so satisfactorily as desirable, and hence, doubtless, the friction which appears to have occurred between members of the company, of which Lazern was the travelling director."!
