ÍHE STORYTELLER. fx HÖHT BATTERY IIS ACTION. BY Ituuv W. CâJtfiUTH. "Ctan voa eee anything P" said the captain of the battery, standing up in his ^ «turupe and petering into tba thick fog. He spoke teran© of hie lieutenants who Bad -ridden np to him at that instant. They gazed and listened together be tween UM guns, m the very centre of the line irf six pieces of aitillery-for the J'onng éAptain's batteiy was unlimbered, Oâded wah canister, and in position for instant filing. So Ulick was the fog that they could ceft neither tne extreme right nor left of theil own guns, around «ach one of widen ita detachment of men stood at * strained attention. From ;the front came the sound of an Mbjnccasional musket «hot, and now and ^^Bhen a bullet hissed far above their heads. ^^Hhb firing , increased in volume, but ^^^Bs »till irregulär «nd scattering. It ^^^?^kled ominously rho w to their light ^^^Rl now to their left, but always deep in ^^Veiog to their front. Suddenly the musket firing developed B^not ar hundred yards from their faces, and ' ": . : a voilej of bullets sang around them. 'Thu' volley:: was "evidenujr replied to by » rattling picket-fire, and just then both ejflîcers exclaimed A very thin Une of Union infantry, so /«hjwuded in the fog that the men seemed like ghosts, came drifting along in \- retreat toward; the guns. Now and then one ©f. these men would turn and -flisoharge. jbis rifle into the thick mist, " and then fetarry to keep ** dressed " on in line with (nie conu^ades, most of whom .seemed^' underetand that their fighting was, jfrat» Htè moment at an end. The «açiain of the battery rode forward to: Snieet them. I ?^jf- ' *Wliere ave thc enehvy P" he demanded, j "aight benind us !" replied the pant- ing lieutenant of the pieket line with a cheeif uljaugh. " We held them to the very ..last, and drove back theil* skir- mishers, but their, main line of battle is \- tnovüag. forward now. ' -j-,. As «fee spoke a heavy musket fire blazed : furiously from the enemy's line; the \- Jeademniasiles flew harmlessly over the . ijattei-y. andthe density of the fog seemed doubled. * *f We won't make that mistake, Allvnf whatever we do," said the captain coolly, lief erring id the enemy's high firing. Then riding to the rear of the line of ' gnus he shouted **&utt; up your screws ! Depress the muzzles well !" "They're right on to us, sb'!" exclaimed y Allyn, dashing up tb his captain; " see, . «ir, see 1" . j The combined fog and smoke- had thinned for an instant, shifted by a breath of the mcrning air. And now, not 50 ^ V'yards before, the guns, checked for an j . instant by a virginia fence, over which j : theyjwere swarming, came the dauntless j ^ - Infantry- of the Southern Confederacy. . ' *' TeSj I 'see," said the captain. I . .'Hue-was tí» instant for which he had waSteçT. It seemed to him then as if his ; ,:rr whole life had been a. preparation for r that erais. The gunner at each piece . ".^ had adjusted the screw to give the gun : ~- the necessary depression, «nd had hrougbt the muzzle to- bear on the line of j the fence.

'-teared and plunged, excited to frenzy hy the thunder of the artillery. ' TÈte captain rode up and down the line ^_ ^"between the guns and then* limbers. His Viïace was turned towards the enemy, from whom no shots came' now. "^Âîas for them ! Their brave advance ' ; was at an enid. The captain could not .". see it, but from the fact that he heard no " ' : more " bróllete whizzing about him . .. he knew as- well as if he had been able to eee tí at on both sides of the rail fence, and indeed on it and among its broken and \spIHttered timbers,' dead and wounded men lay thick. , ? Neither hearing nor feeling shots from hi«fr»ht the young artilleryman knew V ins Si« had been effecfive; but what' r . about ld® flanks? Since, just before v suarise, ne had been ordered to take up that ^osifóon; no 'communication had ; ireachfcdhim fromany one in authority. ^, fié supposed he was provided with an ^ Ninmntrr support both on hie right and <tt*nwfelt out he was not certain. So . ; .* dark lad been the morning, although it w«inthe inontíi of August; so thick v lata liem the fog «nd so occupied had he been -*££h watching for the onslaught of th« èiiênry, that he lmew nothing of what had gone on elsewhere than within his own câBUttàsd. . ^^^^ft^e the command, " Cease : ;4nÄ# ^^»^ Ste of th© camion was ??" aiminnUng,.although the smoke had 1 ? ;'wfflrolí^Í^'*fe* *ñtIffie air over lus struck the sod in front of him, and thea soared away to take rest far within the TJuiou lines. He could discern, as if they were flashes of electricrfor, the flame of the enemy's cannon. They had brought up their guns to crush the battery which had so cruelly repulsed their infantry. " Load with shell!" ordered the captain riding down the line. " Load with shell; and fire at the flashes of their guns !" His guns were rifled and carried a per- cussion shell. So far not a mau or horse of his com- mand had been injured. Every shot of the enemy's had been thrown away. But even as he was wondering at his good fortúnela spherical case burst between the two guns where he at the instant had pulled up his horse. He saw the number one* man drop his sponge-siaff and roll over on the sod, and was conscious that the horse on which he himself sat was ' sinking under him. " Give me your horse, Kelly !" he cried to a boyish-looking soldier who had followed him like hts shadow. The captain and the soldier wei» on their feet at - the same instant. The captain sprang into the saddle vacated ty his follower, who ran to the rear and {brew himself face downwards under a caisson. \- In tbe roar and tumult the young captain wondered more than' ever as" to what was taking place On his right and on his left. Now from both these locali- ties the sound cf firing came sharp and heavy^ and seemed to . move in and to close to the rear. It was as he had feared. - On both sides of him the line had been forced hack, and the enemy was pushing hard on the retreating liue. One regimental commander had given no thought to the battery he had been, ordered to support, and had left it to take care of itself; the other colonel had sent his adjutant, with a warning ; but this messenger lay dead on the field «hot down as he rode on his errand. Am 1 cut off P" thought the captain. " Get the guns off the field into the road oue at a time," he said to Allyn, who was his efficient first officer, " and fall back .then on to oar tine, which is away to ¿he rear by this time. Be quick about it, too ! I .will bring up the veer;" He rode to the right flank and en- couraged the men at these guns: to- in- crease the rapidity of their fire. He could not see his left, hut was conscious that tbe guns there had ceased their fire and were moving away. lu a moment more Allyn reported to him : '"All the guns are in the road but these two." " Take one of these with you," was the reply, " and don't come back." Through the'smokehe saw hisobedient officer disappear with the piece. And now, with the cessation of the fire of five out of six of the guns the air began to clear. Still the hostile battery in bis front kept up its angry demonstration. This was music to his ears, for it indicated that the enemy had not discovered that he was " limbered up " and moving off, At such a time a battery is perfectly defenceless. Now could be get away with the last gunP That was the question. "Cease firing!" he called to the sergeant of the piece. " Limber to the rear ! Poi*ward now for your lives !" The gallant teams of the caisson and . the limber threw their shoulders against the collars with a dash ; horses as well as men seemed to comprehend the extremity -of the errais. The road at the point where the five guns had escaped was already^occupjed by the enemy's infantry. As the smoke lifted and they Saw-the. remaining gun, . they yelled in triumph and fired their rifles at it. One of the three men on the limber ' chest fell back with a bullet in his brain. - " . "Pitch Jiim off," said the captain, sharply. He held his cocked revolver in his baud. "Oblique to the-left. For- ward-forward !" As thé' teams dashed furiously on, the ! enemy, who wer« being every instant reinforced, fired and moved along the read to intercept them'. When the artillery reached the shallow and narrow" ditch which separated the field from the road, the two hostile bodies met for an instant in a wild meîès. The captain does not know to this day how the gun was saved, any more than he knows just when that rifle "ball pierced his leg ; but as his trousers were burned hy the flash of the rifle, it must have been at pretty close quarters. j ' " The sergeant was shot through the ' left arm ; two of the men on the chests were killed.- Neither the captain nor sergeant had a shot left in his revolver when they compared notes a few moments later. With a. wild rush, a lashing and spur- ring of horses, a rapid volley of rifles and cracking of pistols, rambling of wheels and clanking of chains, the last gun of the battery made its retreat from the position it had defended with such consummate gallantry.-Botton Youth's Companion._ Bluffer: " 111 fightths man that called me a Har behind my back if he weighs s ton."
