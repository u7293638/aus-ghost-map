She lennt across a tnbl«\ on which somo j picture of a belated traveller, terrified by a j hideous apparition, had been spread, aud ' hold up her finger in an attitude of playful warning. I shall never forget how she looked that night, as fresh and fair and sweet as the roses the wore in her bosom* ' Come often, sweet ghost,' I said. -(I shall enjoy being haunted;' but, eveD aa I spoke, whether it was that tho idea that she must die — she in her -beauty, who seemed young life impersonated— or that there really is something in the idea Of tbe -supernatural that touohes us against our will, I fe)t that curious cold thrill, Which we all know run , through my veins, and shuddered violently. 'Frightened! frightened already!' she i cried, laughing. 1 Then her face suddenly grew very' grave. Afterward I was out in Ihe garden, where we all found ourselves later, on that mobnlit midsummer night. She, leaning on my arm, looked up at me in a grave way unusual to her, and said : ' Why did you shudder when I threatened to haunt you, Mr. Noble ?' 'Perhaps I was frightened, as you said, Miss Road,' I answered. 'No; you are the one person of my ac quaintance to whom I cannot believe that fear could come,' she said; 'you are very brave. That is why I said I would come to you. I meant it, Mr. Noble ; I actually . meant it — it only sounded like a joke. Somehow it came to me that I should die first of any there, and that—that I — I mean , that you would be the best of them all to come to, to tell what I had learnt when ' death had taught me more ' Than the melanoholy world doth know, Things greater than all lore.' ' She spoke seriously. I answered her in the same mood. 'It was fear I felt, Miss Fannie,' I said — ' fear that the being who makes life more precious to me might leave this world iwhile I still lingered here. Oh, Fannie, if you were gonn, how could I live ?' So it was over. I had uttered the words I had vainly tried to speak for many months, and, as I drew her nearer, I felt her head 'sink on my shoulder, and knew that all was well. So we were betrothed. The next day I put my ring upon her finger, and we were hap pier, so we thought, than any lovers who fever loved before. ' A week from that day; I left America for Europe, whither business called me. I was - to be gone a year. It was terribly hard to . leave Fannie, but the certainty of her love yrent with me, and we had promised to' write to each other by every mail. . ' I tore myself from her presenoe with tears in my -eyes, but still, to ' know she would be mine was delicious^ ' | We lived1 on love; that year— nearer to- ? gether -than many whoBe -lips'1 touch—and ^hen the dreary time was over,' and I wrote ? to her that 1: should Bail for home by the vessel that left -port nexi day,' there was no thought in xny mind that was not a happy one— no' dread, no presentiment'of evil. We had often talked over the promise she' had given, me on tbe evening of our betrothal, and we 'had 'mutually promised each ' other that t*we would' revisit' these' glimpses of the moon if it- were possible;' that the uzihappy one who outlived the other* might know that -love lived on even when the ' eyes were closed in' death.

After all, that is the best [ pravcr wo cau ever breathe;.. but even as I j spoke the wordr-, a strange thrill ran through j my frame, I felt a presence in the room, und arose and turned toward the little door. Some one had entered. . It was a woman. I could not see her features, but only that her face was of a deathly whiteness, and that she held her hands- toward mo, a& if asking me for aid. . 'Who is it?' I asked, gently^ for in that moment of terror conventionalities were cast aside, and it seemed only natural that some of my. terrified fellow- passengers shoold seek my protection. ' Who is it ? What oan I do for you ?' There was no answer ; ; itnit the light by which! T saw the figure— I shall never know what it was— grew stronger and stronger, and my visitor began to look strangely like my betrothed wife. I saw Fannie's features, her floating golden curls, her dimpled ohin, her blue eyes. ' It. is all a delusion,' I said to myself. 'I have been thinking of, her, and the resemblance is only in my imagination. ' Madam,,' I repeated, ' what can I do to help you? I think the storm is no worse. Let us trust to Heaven.' But now the light grew brighter than that of moonlight. With a horror for which I have no words, I saw that it was Fannie who stood before me. The faoe was her face — no other. The eyes her eyes, and on her finger she wore my betrothal ring. 44 Fannie l' I shouted. 41 Fannie!' A voice answered : ' Do not touch me, else I must go, and I long so to be with you. I said I would come. It is strange, 'but it is true. I will wait for you in the mysterious world. But you are not coming yet ; tbe storm will pass. My beloved, my beloved, adieti, adieu.' , She retreated. I sprang forward, but she was gone ; and I fell senseless upon the floor. When I reooverbd myself fte storm had passed. I was in my berth, and greatly boni miserated by my friendB, for a certain wound I had received upon my head. I told no one of my vision. I could only strive to hope that I had been mad or dreaming, but when ; the vessel reached New York I left her with none of those glad hopes that I had fancied wonld animate me upon my return.
