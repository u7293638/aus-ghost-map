"Lhe Marquis of Waterford on Irish A fairs.: -The Marquisof Waterford has delivered as speech on Irish' affairs at the dinner of the Waterford Farming Society. He said the English; Government had been spending its money and sending over its great men to govern the country; still these efforts unless aided' by the people, would be all futile and useless., The Fenian movement (the noble marquis continued) had put Ireland back two centuries... The work of years had been des troyed by that " hellish 'conspiracy," and the many thousands of pounds that might have been spent here were carried elsewhere. Those with whom the, movement originated, he held,..were nothing more than" enthusiasts and robbers," and they elhould, .hi thought thank the Romish clergy 'for'.the example which they' had set from the beginning. Irishmeln, he said'in conclaston, were now shrewd. , They were not what they were 80 years ago. They had become more capable of judging for themselves and they felt that it was" not by following the advice of wiaked men, but by. attending to their own occupi tions,' that, they could hope to be rendered comfortable and happy.

",Mr. Winter. bottom, who has taken so activena part in the disputes about old footpaths ,in the same district, and on the same landlord's estate, occupiod the chair.. "One of the, speskore said that no more tyrannical aot could have been performed by Lord Derby or his agent than to deprive the people of Unsworth of clean water. He believed the well whieb was stopped up 'had been used by the people for a hundred years, and it could be proved to have been in use above sixty years. It would never have been' allowed to be closed had it not occurred "at?

They had formed an assaooiation to defend the people's rights in this matter, and were determined to have opened every well and footpath which had been illegally closed. Lord Derby had deprived the people of their privileges, and made them afraid to call t!.eir souls their own. He had no doubt that were it not for the tyranny Unsworth was oppressed with they would have had ten -times tlie number' of. people present at that meeting. The following resolution was carried unanimonsly :-" That this meeting condemns the condouct of Lord Derby in closing the only well which supplied the people of this locaiiiy with good water for generations past, kthu rendering it' necessary for them to:drink impure water, or go fully a mile each morn ingto obtain the day's supply; and,* further, this meeting deeply sympathises with 'the peoplef(n the sufferings to which they.have been so unnecessarily and cruelly subjected."

As, hbowever, complaints had been made by the police against the conduct of both honses, the applications were refused. In private letters from Madrid it is men tioned that at the news of each successive victory of the Prussians over the Austrians, Queen Isabella of Spain shed tears and broke into lamontations. "It is all over with nus I" she is reported to-have exclaimed, "with, the Pope, with 'Austria, with all of us The heretics, the Protestants, triumph." Like Antonelli, her Most Catholic Majesty thought the world was going to " cascade."

About eight o'clock in the evening the chapel bell wasrunag, when nearly a thousand of the Roman Catholic population from the sur rounding district, most of them armed with ,guns, assembled in Pomeroy. They were evidently well organised, for they' marobed in regular order.to the beat of drums, instantly attended to' such military instructions as "Right abot 'face," and fired about 600 abots. They oflered no violence, however, to any one; and the defence made byt their counsel;' after an ineffectal attempt by the pariah priest, the Rev. Mr. M'Kenna, to get the proceedings quashed on the ground that no occurrence of the kind had ever taken place in the neigh; borhood' before, and the prosecution would engender a bad feeling between the protestants and the Roman Catholice,-wns that Mr. M'Kenna had received an anonymous letter ostensibly from an Orangeman, indirectly inti mating that hischapelwould bedestroyedonthe 12th, and that it was solely to protect it they had assembled. Mr. It'Kenna, on being cross.examined, admitted that he did not be. hove the threat in the letter would be carried out, and when asked why he did not commu nicato its contents to the magistrates, added that "he did not want to raise any alarm." He could not account, he further said, for such a large, number of persons as a thousand collecting in the town, as he only. showed the letter to two persons. The magistrates sent nine of the prisoners for trial. earltluake in Paris.-Tho Paris papers give details of the shook of earthquake ex perienced in Paris. As far as Paris is con corned ir'is to be remarked that whilst in one street the 'bseillations were so violent as to frighten people from their houses, in the neighboring streets the shocks were hardly perceptible: A house in the Rue Malioro has received such a shaking as to require props. In the environs of Paris the oscillations were severely felt, especially at St. Cloud, and at Samur, Limoges, Carecasonne, Perignenx, Clermont, Riom, Nantes, Angers, &o.; The shoocks, which all took place at the same mo. mont, were sufficiently felt to aronse the in. habitants from their sleep, and manyof them thought that the end of the world was come. From Riom the account says that a dull' detonation preceded the trembling 'ot the earth... ,The last time that Paris received a shook wsa in 1822, when the oseillations were in exactly the same direction, that is, from south-east to north.east.
