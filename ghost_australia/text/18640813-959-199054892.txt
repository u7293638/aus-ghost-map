CRICKET. The Cricketers of Victoria. The subject of our present notice is a gen- tleman whoso name has, amongst Australian cricketers, become a household word, and who has for some years held the position of champion single-wicket player in this colony— MR, THOMAS WENTWORTH WILLS, Who was born in the sister colony of New South Wales, was educated in England, and acquired his knowledge of the game of cricket at Rugby, where he obtained the degree of captain of the eleven. Mr. Wills returned to this colony by the Oneida, in December, 1856, and took part in the Intercolonial match the following January, at Sydney. He was captain of the Victorian Eleven in 1857 and three following years, in each of which latter matches Victoria was trium- phant. He was a member, at various times, of the M.C.C., Richmond, and many other clubs, was one year hon. sec. of the M.C.C., and played for several seasons in every important match ; was also captain of the United Victorian Eleven for one sea- son. He visited Queensland with his father, in 1860, returning soon afterwards, and was captain at the last Intercolonial Match at Sydney in 1863, when the " Jones dispute" took place. He returned to Queensland again, and subsequently visited Victoria in January 1864, since which time he has played in the following matches :— England v Twenty-two of Sandhurst— January 7, at Sandhurst : c Jackson, b Tinley ... 0 b Tinley ... ... .... 2— 2 England v Twenty-two of Ballaarat—Janu- ary 11, at Ballaarat : b Hayward ... ... 4 c Grace, b Jackson ... 32— 35 England v Twenty two of Ararat—January 14, at Ararat : b Jackson ... ... ... 6 c Tinley, b Grace ... 0— 6 England v Twenty-two of Maryborough— January 18, at Maryborough : b Tinley ... ... ... 1 b Jackson ... ... ... 4— 5 England v Twenty-two of Otago and Canter- bury—February 2, at Dunedin : c Lockyer, b Tinley ... 11 c Carpenter, b Tinley ... 1 — 12 England v Twenty-two of Canterbury— February 4, at Canterbury : runout ... ... ... 4 b Jackson ... ... ... 6— 10 England v Twenty-two of Otago—February 16, at Dunedin : b Tinley ... ... ... 1 b Tinley ... ... ... 20— 21 Parr's Eleven v Anderson's—March 5, on M.C.C. ground : b Tinley ... ... ... 4 East Melbourne v Ballaarat—March. 12, at East Melbourne ground : b Wilkie ... ... ... 0 England v Twenty two of Geelong—April 12, at Geelong : b Tarrant ... ... ... 6 b Tinley ... ... ... 9— 15 England v Twenty-two of Ballaarat—April 18, at Ballaarat : c Grace, b Jackson ... 1 c Tarrant b Tinley ... 2— 3 England v Twenty-two of Victoria—April 21, on M.C.C. ground : c Anderson, b Jackson ... 10 b Tarrant ... ... ... 0— 10 Fifteen of Heathcote v Mitchell's Eleven— May 5, at Heathcote : b Robinson ... ... ... 20— 29 Total runs scored by Mr. T. W. Wills in thirteen matches, or twenty-four innings, which he played during the season ... ... ... ... ... 153 All his matches were first-class, excepting one. His average for the whole season is 6— 9 over, and in principal matches he scored 124 runs, his average being 5—14 over. During the visit of the first All England Eleven, as is well known, Mr. Will's ser- vices were lost to the colony, as he was at the time residing on his father's station at Nogoa, in Queensland, and during the two years that elapsed between the first series of All England matches, when the British champions were under H. H. Stephenson's captaincy, and the advent of Parr's Eleven, Mr. Wills had little opportunity for practice at his favourite game. It was expected that he would, however, return to Victoria in time to form one of the Victorian twenty-two for the first match, on New Year's Day, 1864, and a place was kept open for him to the last moment. This expectation was, however, doomed to meet with disappointment, as owing to adverse winds and rough weather, the steamer from Queensland was over her time, and the well-known form of Tommy Wills was not seen on the M.C.C. ground until the match was nearly terminated, when he acted as substitute in the field for Mr. O'Brien, and it is hardly necessary to say that his appearance was greeted with a round of cheering from all present. The "ubiquitous Tommy" was not, however, long out of harness on his own account. The Bendigonians were glad to enlist him in their ranks, and on their hard, dusty, ground, in scorching weather, which we fancy even Queensland could not surpass, Mr. Wills first found himself opposed, on Victorian soil, to the cracks of England. In batting he was, of course, at a disadvantage from want of practice, and he did nothing worthy of men tion ; but in the first innings of the Eleven he got six wickets, Tarrant, Caesar, Hayward, Carpenter, Clarke, and Jackson, in 140 balls for 35 runs. This was splendid bowling indeed, considering his long absence from the field, and against such wickets, as Carpen- ter's score of 17 was the most any of the six got, Hayward only scoring 3, Tarrant 4, and Caesar 5, Jackson and Clarke being content with a single ; Grace was also caught at short slip by him for nothing from the first ball of Glen's.

Being a good Bailor, Mr. Wills was not onq of Neptune's victims, and was uo doubt a subject of envy to Anderson and one or two others of the team, who had their share of those miseries that attend on most landsmen when on ' tho briny.' Ho shared tho glori ous reception at Otago, in which Shadraeh Jones and 'the Ghost,' his factotum, had racked their inventive brains to create a sensation 'that should stir up tho bosoms and open tho purse-strings' of tho phlegmatic Otagonians ; but all to no purpose, as although the reception was a success, the matches, in a the first matcuv/Twenty-twoof Otago hetook no part, but whether owing to his own modesty or from want of appreciation on the part of tho match committee, wo aro not prepared to say. In the second match, when tho united elevens of Canterbury and Otago wero com bined, your correspondent notes that they had tho good sense to secure Mr. Wills, and ho got 11, tho highest score, in tho first innings, ero' Tbookyor caught him at tho wicket, but was soon caught by Carpenter at point, off tho crafty Tuucy, in tho second. Ho got in this match four of the England wickets, viz., Grace, Carpenter, Caffyn, and Parr, tho whole eleven being out for a score 01 i-i, to wnicn mo united sorcu »u in tile first innings. From D uncdin ho accompanied tho team on their ' ' Canterbury pilgrimage,' and a vory pleasant ono it proved, many of the players (amongst them Tennant, who got tho nighest score, 28) Jbeing old Rugbroans and other public school men. Tho Twenty two were beaten in one innings. Wills took six of tho England wickets, viz., Grace (tho first ball), Tan-ant, JAnderson, Hayward, Carpenter, and Parr, in 208 balls for 65 rims, which was very good. In tho last match the Eleven again had it all their own way. Wills, however, made a fino scoro of 20, but was not so well up in his bowling, as he only got two wickets. On his return to Victorian soil, all tho better for his sea trip, in marked contrast to some of tho Eleven, wo find him 'all there' on tho MC.C. ground as ono of tho winning side, Ander son's Eleven y. Parr's. Ho had only ono innings, in which Tinley, who had taken his measuro to a nicety, soon found out tho sticks ; but in bowling, ' tho novico' was ono too many for somo of tho cracks, serving Caqicnter in a manner ho had never been served before — viz., bowling him tho first ball, also Caisar much in tho samo fashion. In HO balls ho got four wickets, Caisar, Car penter, Kelly, and Tait, and also very neatly caught CafTyn and Parr off Graco s slows. In tho East Melbouruo v. Ballaarat match, ho was the only ono of the Ballaarat team to fet a duck's egg, and in bowling ho did little, lis next match was on homo ground, viz., Geelong, and on the pretty turf of tho Corio Club a very pleasant match took placo be tween 'Old England's two and nine' and tho Twenty-two of tho Geelong district, under the captaincy of Mr. S. S. Rcnnic. In batting Wills did not do much, but in bowl ingheput on that day an extra t wiBt, getting six wickets in 132 balls for 48 runs. Grace soon fell a victim ; Carpenter ho got again very Boon ; alBO Tarrant, Hayward, Lookyor, and Clarke, and but for somo bungling in the management at the beginning of tho England innings, and somo bad luck, tho Eleven would have scored much less. Truo to his friends, T. W. W. paid Ballaarat anothor visit, and no doubt was pleased to soo his former victim, Carpenter, get that long score of 121. Tho match was a failuro as far as licking the Eleven, as the boot was on t'othor leg. Wills was caught at the wicket Tjy Grace, tho wicket-keeper^ amidst great laughter; and in his second, in hitting to the on sharply, he gavo Tarrant a very difficult chance, which was taken with ono hand, to Tommy's intense surprise and chagrin. In this match ho bowled 100 balls for onlv 9 ninH. His last important match was as captain of the Victorian Twenty-two, in the f arowell contest on tho M.C.C. ground, and excel lently ho discharged tho important duties pertaining to it In Wb first innings, in batting, ho mado a creditablo score of 10, and in the second ho was one of Tear'cm's victims ere ho could get his oyo in. Tho Eleven scored 131 runs, off no less than nino bowlers, 29 runs off 212 balls of Coss tick's, 31 from 112 of Hewitt's, 10 from 84 of Bryant's, 8 from 1G of Greaves' e, 4 from 24 of A'Beckett's, 4 from 10 of Glen's, 24 from 108 of Wills's, 7 from 28 of Conway's, and 3 from 12 of WarduTs.- The captain evidently believed in variety, and that if good bowling could not get ' the best players in England, a change even for tho worse might do the trick. The judgment ho displayed enabled Victoria to head the Eleven in tho first innings, and it ia to be hoped his tactics will not be forgotten by any futuro Vic torian captain. Tho score of tho Eleven would also havo been materially reduced had certain fieldsmen not been Buffering from butter- lingers. This last match, unfortu nately; lost much of its interest from the wet weather. Mr. Wills finished Ids eoason with a little uj-country affair at Ucathcate, where, with M.ikinson, Ccnway, Mortimer, Jacomb, and Thornton (the Victorian long Btop in a forn.er Intercolonial Match), ho aSBiuled in pi liaHng off sixteen of tho Hoath eoti-. cricketers, much to Mr. ' Mitchell's satisfaction, an lio was tho originator of tho match. Willn 'cored 20 in tho second innings, :.yun«t, some v-jy fair bowling on rather pceuiir.r i-romul, rendering gnvii caution nc-.-wsary j diupose of tho twisting gmbbore tlift p.-oi iii.Mnfs delight in.

It is possiblo often to got a good wickot on uneven turf, but for good cricket, tho wholo surface of tho cricket ground should bo ono uniform lovol space through out Tho kind of grass I bohevo in is a short, stout grass, ono that docs not run up into long stalks, nor have ,a tendency at the root to ramify and become thicker and thicker every season. Such grass may bo very well for lawns, or bowling - greens, but for cricket I don't beliovo 111 it. I like a turf only moderately thick, but sound, on a good, sound under-soil, a turf that keeps short and close, aiid that would never produco a crop of hay. Such grass as wo so often meet with on the commons and village greens of old England, but which wo rarely, U over, seo in this colony. And I don't believe in clover ; I hate tho sight of it on a cricket ground, though, moro or less, it is generally to bo found on all. It grows so profusoly that it dwarfs tho grass, and in this climate it is burnt up very soon ; a few days' hot wind scorches it bo that it never recovers during tho soason. Tho best natural turf I ovor saw (and I havo seen a good many in my, timo) was at Parker's Piece, at Cambridge, and I remember an excellent authority, TiViimnr fl»n nAiolirnfi»d nlntrpr nf vnnrs TlvrrdTin. jtten telling mo that it was as good a natural turf as could bo found in England. It was sound and truo ; tho ball always came tvuo m it, and when hit it flow along for fives and sixes, ay and ninospn'ow and then, as old Lilly has found tdthjs cost. There was no bumping on it, and iragouM last tho season through without repairing ; in fact, it had to Btand Bomo 300 wickets per day all through, tho May term, and we never had tho least difficulty in finding good ones, or rather having them found for us, each college having its own plot, which was sacred from intrusion. Tho only ground that could compare with it is the Hovo ground at Brighton : this is so true, so sound and good, that it is a real batsman's ground, and long scores aro always got ; but it is, or was when I knew it, a splendid ground to play on, and by no moans a fagging or tiring one, which I hold to bo a great drawback in a cricket ground. lam very loth to find any fault with tho Mel bourne Cricket Ground, but it is just in this particular I think it deficient j it is becoming moro and moro a thickly carpeted pieco of turf, between Yan Yean and manure, and a dull, trying ground to play upon. It is not a true turf eithor, far from it, and when tho top gets worn a littlo 'won't sho bump.' If the M.C.C. turf had been similar to such as Parker's Pieco, wo should not havo seen Hayward and Carpenter rubbing their ribs and their knuckles after one dayk play on it. It always looks well, but the proof of tho pudding is in tho eating ; it looks better to the eye than it proves good for wear. In tho match I allude to, the M.C.C. ground had every chance, for thero had been no hot weather, and tho wicket had been. prepared and shopherded by Rowloy for weeks ; he had studied it by day and dreamt of it by night; but, nevertheless, it would not stand one inning's wear and tear, and remain true, nor could a hundred Rowleys havo mado it do so. Tho turf on tho MC.C. ground is becoming thicker and thicker every year ; tho subsoil is not of the soundest, and instead of being a lively, springy turf, it is moro like playing on » pilo carpet than anything else. I remember once playing a match at Lord Braybrooko's place, Audley End, and to look at from a distance, tho ground, which was in front of the mansion, was the most perfect a cricketer could desire. Once on it, however, tho illusion was dispelled, and I remember before our day's (and my last day's) play thero -waB over, wo each and all cursed it from tho bottom of our heartB, as tho veriest impoBturo of a ground ever trodden upon. It was a thick, mossy, interwoven kind of turf, that would break n bowler's heart in halfa dozen overs. I ani not going to enter into tho particulars of drainage, etc., because it is not in my lino for ono good reason, and another, that anyone who desires such information may easily obtain it I may state that stiff, clay soils must bo drained, and thoso whoso grounds are so situated would do woll to havo half an-hour's conversation with Mr. Bagot, and inspect tho plan of the drainage system pursued on tho Warehousemen's new ground. I believe that Mr. Bagot has hit tho right nail on tho head, ana that his ground will becomo as good as it is possiblo to mako in this colony— which im-ana that I don't bo lievc, with our fsuinmurs, it in possible! ever to raiiko a permanently good sound ground. It must over bo miuntitincd by n syiilem of patching and repairing what with clover, captiwucd, and other nuisances that coimtuntly aiito. I ilou't know whnt seeds Mr. Bagot has sown — rye-grass, I think — but I am told that the best kinds ai « the ' fiefcted dogtoU,' the 'sheep's fescue,'1 and the 'cynodon dactylon' {n kind of couch grass), and that it h always best to sow several varieties together; but I would strongly udvitic against sowing imy grass that runs up into a long stem, and has a tendency to thicken, spread, and inter twino over tho soiL I may, of course, bu wrung; but, .is n cricketer^ I know which kind of grass I prefer to play upoa.

I often admiro tho pluck and spirit with which cricket under supremo difficulties - is carried on upon such bare, bumpy spots as abound in the neighbourhood of Melbourne. So deep-seated amongst our nativo youth is tho love of the game, that I 'havo often steu excellent play in tho Herald Passage— catches mado that would astonish oven Carpenter. With such native talent wo only want good grounds handy to our city to turn out players equal to any tho world has produced. What a fine placo for cricket this would bo if, instead of exclusive grounds, wo had a fino common such as Parker's Piece, with a good turf all over it, open to all What matches thoro would bo, and what rivalry it would create between 'thonobs' and 'thosnobs.' I expect Boon to boo the day when ' private boxes' will becomo an institution on tho ground of our leading club. But as I havo run away from my subject, I will como to' a conclusion at onco with a LONG STOP. P. S.— Carpenter, Hayward, and Tarrant first loarnt tuoir cricket on Parker's Piece, and for many years the town eleven of Cam bridgo could almost play any county eleven in England. This shows what good grounds will do in tho cause of uricket. '
