"Tf A GREAT CONFERENCE. ; (From the San Francisco News Letter.) ; , The conference between Home Ministers and ; \--"Colonial Delegates, which has been in session in : »j!jLondon for some weeks past, is iu many respects i Ulthe inost important assemblage the world ever //saw. The men who compose it are repreBenta- : /gtives of the vast domain over which Great: Britain holds sway. From the North and' South, ' i'-.tthe East and West, men have gathered who aro . //engaged in building up great States. Tho i S/JHoiiie Government is represented by Lord Salis- -iH|buay and the leading members of the Cabinet, : //Governors-General, Prime Ministers, heads of ; departments, members of Parliament. and other- / high officials are there in great force. They. come from Canada, which skirts the entiro > northern boundary of tho United ' states and /stretches away north until it reaches the realms i ./of eternal ice ; from tho sunny Southern .Austral land, whose area -equals that of the, I States and Territories of this Union, without' .-/Alaska ; from New Zealand, which has in an enlarged decree all the products that have liiadc .//i" the tight little Island at homo" tho centre of /'wealth that it is ; from India, with its vast trade \--.band its teeming millions of men and money ;: /if iom such important strategical points as Hong ; A, Kong, Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Ceylon, King .-VGeorge's Sound, Vancouver, etc., anil, in short, fiom ill the leading centres of that mighty /Empire on which " the sun never sets." They' \- represent a population of over 300,000,000, or; \- - nearly one-third of the inhabitants of tho entire: './globe ; and that by no means the most insignifi- c mt third either in point of education, civilisa- \- tion and wealth-creating capacity. These rc-- presentatives have met in conference to devise ./ways and means by which to more completely ..iconsohdate thc whole Empire. They are agreed upon their purpose, though there may bo. /differences of opinion as to the best means of \- promoting it, and a more hard -.headed, practical \- and yet enthusiastic congregation of experienced K/nien it would be difficult to imagine. The way to improve mail facilities, increase //.ocean telegraph cables, establish more steam /-lines, sustain the Colonial, Inter- Colonial and Impel i il routes of travel and commerce, and geneially to build up the moral and material, as Well .is tlio sentimental ties that should bind the \- >Whole together, have been discussed iu a manner /—Worthy of such a conference of Imperial .state3- ,%ihen. Naturally enough tho wonderful com- !;7.iinerce of the Empire was frequently and fondly >;/(filwelt upon. Some very astonishing figures woro /iSquotod. Tlio value of British ships and of the //'freight they carry annually reaches at tho pre- v-'ient time the stupendous total of ;'6,000,000,000(lols ! And yet British interests in ijtea- borno commerce aro oven- larger than that, ./for much of what appears to be foreign trndo is /Slither British property or security for British /Advances. In 188(i the total tonnage of tho sca- 7|fing mercantile ships of tho world amounted to Tgo, 500,000 tons, and of this total no less than )||4,500,000 — or more than two-thirds of tlio whole )4r-belonged 'to tho ' British Empire. Of tho ;.'|iiierchant steamers capable of making 14 or more K /knots per hour 95 per cent tiro sailed under the British flag, and tho whole hundred per cent. ;S|-wcro built within the British dominions. Of tho ijcommorco which passed through tho Suez Canal ;fjin 1886, 87 per cent was carried in British -.//bottoms. The telegraph cablo system of tho s7jworld amounts to 107,000 miles, and has cost ||l85,000,000dol. Of that system all but 7,000 i/lniles are entirely under British control, and are Klho result of private enterprise. Australia alone increased its population twolvo fold in 40 years, .ijSnd raised its imports from 7,500,000dols to 7'317,500,000dols in 1885. 5|. Figures equally portentous might bo given at ;oj>groat longtli, but space forbids, and, besides, Si/enough have been quoted to suffice to enablo all .reflecting minds to realise the greatness of tlio Empire that for tho first time has recently been Represented in conference in London. Such a ijl'show- ing is a curious commentary upon the New Ij/York ' Herald' and other telegrams, which daily : endeavour to educate tho people of this country //--into tho vain belief, that tho decadence of tho /JfBritish Empiro has set in, and tlmt it is only a 'question of time when " the whole rotton she- S:'Jbaiig" will cease to interest the living world, // excopt as tho ghost of a dead past. . .
