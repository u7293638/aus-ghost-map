CHURCH OF ENGLAND. LAYING THE FOUNDATION-STONE. On Monday last the ceremony of laying the foundation-stone of the Church of England was performed by F. W. Roche, Esq., J.P., in presence of a large and respectable concourse of people, comprising members of all denomi- nations in town. The day was remarkably fine, and an awning had been erected by the contractor, Mr. Hill, which afforded protection from the hot sun to a greater portion of the persons present. The site of the building is nearly opposite the School of Arts, and on the Church of England school reserve. Some time previous to that appointed for the cere- mony (twelve noon) a large body of ladies and gentlemen had assembled beneath the awning, and all manifested great interest in the pro- ceedings. Precisely at noon, the Rev. E. G. Moberly gave out Psalm CXLV, commencing " I will magnify thee, O God my king," in which all joined. A prayer and Psalm LXXXIV. —" O, how amiable are thy dwellings"— followed, when the stone was lowered into its place, and duly adjusted ; Mr. Roche saying, " In the faith of Jesus Christ we place this foundation-stone, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." A hymn was then sung, several prayers read, and the proceedings terminated with the Lord's Prayer and the benediction. Previous to the stone being lowered, some silver coins and a copy of the Dalby Herald and the Brisbane Courier of Thursday last were deposited in a cavity beneath it.
