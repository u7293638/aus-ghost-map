He stood within a lobby, And said, in tones V corn cobby/* * "I'd give for drink so nobby— A quid;" 'Twas sad to get his glut up, And oh! he felt so cut up, 'Cos all the pubs, were shut up— 'Twas night. " Where," said he, " shall I lurk to?" No bother would I shirk to— What swindle shall I work to Get tight P " The stars o'er head were braining, In palish radiance'gleaming, The while he thus was dreaming— The scamp. A happy thought now scoots out, A hotel lamp salutes out— He climbs the post and .puts out The lamp. He did down from the -post, And roused the slumb'ring host. And.said, "There's not a ghost Of a light! "Do you know this here fact, That under Hotel Act, With fine you may be racked, Honor Bright 1" The host, but half awake, Said, " Please, no bother moke, Say nothing—would you take A drink?" The words that bobby thrill, He says, " Old man, I will Just take a snift of swill, I think." And, as he said he thunk, Why, so the peeling skunk, Just drunk, and drunk, and drunk Quite deep. Next morn, the hottest verb, Could not that " trap " disturb, A-lyiag on the kerb, Asleep. • "What on earth does this mean ?"—Ed. " Husk'-y, of course."—Bard,
