Indeed lie, of tWtwo,' was probably"byfar the b'ettei? judge of; the lady's marketable " points," and there is 110 doubt that, as far as in bis blase little powerful impression upon liim. That which, however, ; most vpaislgealilrly allured bim was undoubtedly the " Goscheus," and -with the autoeraj^ professor-poet's young man, Tom, lie would have said : Though fail- her features he It is her Jignre pleases 111c. . Another thing,,, top, which added piquancy to ber pursuit was .the up-, torious fact that, in. the preceding season,. Khp.i h a d f - i ^ U ] ^ blooded a'dvances .of 'a. spJeudid Russian Iiad ^•^-at^Q^tjh'e"aristdcrat*iC-overture?- of an Austrian priuclet with a maddening disdain. The former had hastened back to his beloved Paris, and despairingly plunged into the wildest of excesses ; the latter had. fallen an easy victim to the designing daughter of a well-known ex-tobacconist of the West End. These things had been the common talk of the town, and, although they were to Lady Hilda painful memories, nevertheless they proved an additional charm to one who loved a 'lash of cayenne in every dish. Sir Harry might perhaps, if ever,: he gave a thought % matters which had no personal bearing, have agreed that that country is happy which has 110 history, but a woman without a past he considered of all things the most insipid. As to his rival, Claude Brathwaite, 011 the other baud, much need not here be said, except that where Sir lian-y was of a calculating turn of mind, Claude was disinterested ; where Sir Harry looked upon women as chattels, Claude looked upon them as angels. Which of these young •men was furthest out in bis estimate it cioes not. concern us here to discus.-;. The year was drawing to a close at the time our story opens. The Framley Butts Christmas party was complete, and Sir Harry Penniless and Claude Brathwaite were for the first time guests in the ancestral halls of Lady Hilda's father, the Marquis of Flinders. Their professed object was the shooting of pheasants ; their real and perfectly ostensible pursuit the larger human game above mentioned Amongst the guests there was one looker-on who took the deepest in tcrest in the rivalry of these two "•'ing men. This was old Lady Pen 'Hie*,.. generally given to those who can boast an unusually large .proportion of that commodity. 'She was one of those who hold themselves licensed to say the rudest thiugs in the rudest mauner, provided their observations are seasoned with a little smartness. She always walked- withthe support of an ebony stick, and, just as she considered that everyone who had pet corns or gouty toes should keep .hemselves out of its -way, so she considered any protruding moral excrescence to be fair game for the exercise of her sarcastic wit. ; She bad witnessed every vice.that she-had not practised, and was generally spoken of as " that wicked old woman." Indeed, there was but one virtue, -which was ungrudgingly conceded to her, and that was a deep and real affection for her disreputable little son. That he was not a model of virtue has already appeared, but he, too, must have his due.- There was no' denying .'it that, in' a' very rough and uncouth uianher, Sir Harry Penniless,' on 1 liis side, e.yiijced' a^vei-y strong afcetioit for his'wicked'old lady mother Thus, it camp about .these two ..Wi'ere inseparable ; eonipiuibiis, Jiving.ilto gether in London, pubting together at Monte"' baccarat at-.
