We read this qa •:Paalm; carefui 1 j through, it will at least show what we ought to have meant by them- [We shall find therein abundant r*ason to justify rSl - our presence here; for it tells of the wonderful tf•* . works of Odd, of themight of His marvellous X' ■ r sets; it tells of a kingdom which is everlasting, ^■rvilof«\dbmxnibn' enduring throughout all ages ; also-tells of tenderJ compassion, and of •; i ^^greftt loving-kindiiess, of an car that is open to hear; and a hand that is open to give.

'Bohappy, eif^'teh^eefulf and thankful as ever we can,*'writes _;.pean 8tanley in one of his lectures, ' we : ,;.v- cannot .go beyond the Psalms. They see lidi -God's goodness everywhere.

My brethren, I venture to affirm that no " possible discoveiy bf science! rain' do away with the Wounds of oar faith in' a living God;. Wc need Wot be anxious'' with respect to: the last discovery of- the physiologist or the chemist,- ..as ftough.life :wero about to be emptied of its meaning; and its mystery. Man is , what, he ' is,. through whatever processes ; he became what ho is. Be sore that we can scarcely fall into a more melancholy mistake than to look, or seem to look, with an; v thing like suspicion oil the progress of science; truly so called! A man with real faith in God should regard established discovery uf' things is earth, or sea, or sky, which he can underi standi and appreciate, as just a. new comment on tbe Psalmist's woras) * All thy works.' To him the true should ever be the welcome. •; Ho' shonl 1 be like a builier receiving stone after stone from the workers in various quarries, some of whom may possibly he so engrossed with their occupations that they see little beyond , the quarries' walls, and fitting each into its place in too temple of-his faith and worship.;1 The sciences may be thehandmaids of Theology; she,; as of old, being recognised toeir queen.; It was in this spirit that 'Kepler rejoiced over! liis discoveries, rejoiced because he was learning! to think the thoughts of God; and conolnded his work on the ' Harmony of worldB' with; these noble words, 'I thank Thee, my Creator! and Lord, that Thou hast given me this joy in Thy creation, tois delight in the work of Thy, hands. I have shown toe excellency of Thy works unto me, so far as my .finite mindj was able to comprehend Thy infinity;; If I have said anght unworthy of Thee, or,!aught! in' • which 1 may have songht my own glory, gra ciously forgive it.' In such words you!can read the humility and reverence of a genuine seeker after truth.. There is no affected depre-' ciation.of his own researches and attainments, but, at the same time, there is a most beautiful and touching confession that .'God- was .in. Heaven, while he was upon earth.' ': ! When we speak of the wisdom borne by the works of God to His nature and character, we do not mean: that His existence can bo proved by anything we can see or touch in toe same way that any truth about numbeis or dimen sions can be proved. It is 'mow correct; to describe toe thought of a Supreme intelligence as a thought that arises naturally in. the mind ofman. -The idea of God hss been called a deep necessity of toe-mind, while another writer has forcibly expressed it tons : ' When the mind rises, it throws' the body upon its knees.' This natural consciousness of; the Divine,' "which' has - found 'expresaion in a thousand. ;forms of : faith.-; andir worship, is edncated and. developed'.' by' the; ex perience . of life.. And it is marvellous now, when- wa have once given ita rightful place in heart, and mind to the great traih of' all: truthi, all things ■ speak; ill harmony there * -with, and Nature hersrif become! arevelation of God. - We lookat this great.universe—. around ns,aboveiis, beneath our feet—and we listen while it tells to them'who hayo.fsrs to hear the wondrous story of its life; wertxace, or we learn how others have traced or are tracmgj themarrels of therxastTnanhinery; we find that change, unceasingchange, retheyeiy law of. finite being j that changes numberless form the history, of; the .world from, day to day : and,' • wa ask, Whence :all this ! rich variety ? "Where ie the- power beyond and behind the things which- -are seen and handled, which gave them their- being and their place in the great order? There ore teachers, as we'have seen, who would advise ue to silence theso questionings within,'and give up as a hopeless quest all inquiry into the whence and wherefore of'the1 world s abundant li e. They would have ns be content with weighing and measuring,- and describing those agents which man can subject to the scales and teste of exact knowledge. Bat we will hot so dwarf our nature, which reaches forth unto that which is above itself.'We will not believe that "that feeling after God, if haply they might find him, which has been;the highest occupation of the noblest spirits among the souls' of men, has;been all in vain and to no purpose. Thousands of voices, rising from hearts that have sought their God in pagan as well as Christian lands, rebuke so mean an estimate of human effort. Just listen to words of praise from the pen of a heathen poet, in quoting whoml have the example of St. Paul: ' Supreme, immortal God, many-named eternal Governor, Disposer of Nature, Thou that guid'et all according to laws—hail to Thee 1 It, is granted to every man to speak with Thee, .for we sre of Thy raco., A key-note -was given to each b-ing who lives and .moves on earth for a voice. With it will I praise Thee and: ever exalt Thy power.' : Thus, then, wo would have naturo earefally observed, in the belief , that- the observation of nature is a study of " the'works-of God. In laws of nature we will read' his' methods of working. To some of us it-has very likely eoemed' at times as if God was being almost chut out from the world by the 'discovery of these laws—as if ■ nature were bring reduced to a huge machine, going on of itself. But rarely this - suspicion. only needs to bo examined in order to be dismissed. For show the reign of .Haw to be as far-seeing as you will; it can never, take the place of Power.' A ldw only describes what is done—it does not tellm of thereal influence at work in' the doing. ; Nay, in the very-regularity—in what is sometimes called the uniformity—of Nature, reason will surriy bid us, see not the absence of; God bnt His consistency of: action—His faith fulness to His own methods. If you were to go into a large manufactory, and there see that all persons and: agents employed were in their places and doing their work, according to a pre- arranged system, so that by wise tub: division of labour anddoe appointment of time; processes! were earned on with derision and 1 regularity instead of being left to (banco and caprice, 5fQuld vy <ftl ;oOIi&udJJ;,Jhat there wal no ttiitiJ at t^jheaduof^that establishment*! ^ ;think thafcu^u^wo^d:adiaire>theiiri8(Jcitt that , "planned that marrellbus regularity: and bo -we [meed -not'fearth&tr; th'e~fii&^i^of~la*s jwill compel us to dismiss, the beliefjin a Godyrho rules as- superfluous* • Such discovpry will rather add nowjforce -to the Apostle's Jissortion! that c God is nbt the author of confus&n.;' i In', their order all-, Hlw works praise the God of order. : V" ' :l - •. *"■* And just as in that manufactory,' where; wo were just now admiring tho regularitr ofi the" |"Trorktog, we should be interested in observing : the adaptation of means to endsj so too to the universe—blike in" what,wo count , little afl;in what we count great—we may see the resulto of. the working of an tolelligent will.
