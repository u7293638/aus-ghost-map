SATURDAY, NO VE M BE It 9,1895. The perplexities of empire must; at the present moment press very cruelly on Lord SALISBURY. Ile lias just now within clear political vision the pro- bability of hnlf-a-dozon "little wars," and tho possibility of two great wars on a scale hithorto unknown to history. Another march to Ashantee is on foot ; the Boers at the Cape, who havo just closed the fords on the Vaal, aro " invited " by cablogram to re-open them in ton days, otherwiso, apparently, Majuba Hill will havo to bo re-fought this tiniOjNve maybe sure, under different conditious. Another South American republic has to bo taught manners by the logic of a squadron of ironclads ; a British subject slain somowhero in Central Africa has to bo avenged, ovon if the Congo Freo State goes to pieces in tho process. Thero aro disputes on tho Mokong, and quarrels about tho Shan States ; thero is a " Morocco question," an "Egyptian " question." Yet these, though grave enough, aro the small dust of the political balance. Turkey is visibly tumbling to pieces ; a British ileet may havo to enter the Dardanelles to protect the SULTAN from his own sub- jects, and this would probably bo the signal for tho march of Russian troops into Armenia and tho instant outbreak of revolt in all tho Christian provinces of Turkey, and the emergence, in its acutest form, of that " Eastorn ques " tion " which has to European politics tho relation that a match has to a powder magazine. But Lord SALISBURY'S anxieties aro by no means confined to Europo. What Nvill happen if, to all tho other explosive forcos at work in China, a successful religious revolt is added t The Moham- medan uprising in the North-Eastern province of China may easily provo fatal to the roigning dynasty, and Nvhat will happen if the political system under which nearly ono-third of the human raco has dtvolt for centuries tumbles suddenly into ruins 1 European states niansliip has survived the partition of Africa,but tho partition of China might well knidlo anothor planet shaking war Otgamsms with a low dogreoof vitality are curiously hard to kill, and the Manchu dynasty, which has Burvivod contunos of misgovornmont and a scoro of rebellions, may emerge undestroyod from oven tua present cntacljsm But still thoro remains tho rivalry of Russia and Japan, a disturbing force mighty enough to destroy tho equih brium of the world's politics How tho bald recital of thoBO facts justifies afresh MAI Tin w ARNOLD'S fino but hacknoyed figuro of england aa tho " weaned Titan " of tho nations !

In proposing the toast ot the mern bera of the board, Captain Currie remarked that the board had very great powers, but from the quiet and unobtrusive way in which these had been exercised it hardly loomed so large in tho publia eye as it ehould do. Succeeding speakers urged the theory^ that the board a work had been so efficiently and excellently done that there waa never any reason why public attention Bhould be prominently directed to it. 'J he toast of "Hie Chairman" drew out a warm eulogy of Captain Currie'a strict integrity and of the exceptional services which Ina intimate knowledge, not only of nautical affaira bat of banking and commerce, enabled him to render to the board. Mr. M'Kie, the secre- tary, and the officers of tlie board were also accorded ii gratif)ing tribute of praise for the faithful and energetic manner in which they had carried out their duties, and the gathering broke up soon nfter 3 o'olock. It is announced that the founder of the Salvation Army, "General" Booth, will be visiting Melbourne from November 22 to 27, and will conduct a series of meetings in the Melbourne Town-hall and Exhibition building. The "General," who is accompanied by "Commissioner" Pollard, "Colonel" Lanley, "Major" Malun, and " Staff captain" Heather, will arrive on Friday morning, the 22nd inst., by the Sydney express. The army authorities intend giving him a characteristic welcome at the Spencer street station, and it is expected a great muster of the forces will take place. All the Victorian officers of every rank are to be in Melbourne to join in the reception demonstration. There is to be a large procession from the Model Schools the same evening, and after this the public welcome in the Town-hall. The "General" at this meeting will give an address on the " Present Position of the Salvation Army." The Exhi- bition building is taken for Sunday's meeting, the 24th, and on Monday and Tuesday, the 25th and 26th - three meetings each day. On Wednesday evening, the 27th, the "General" will give his address on " Social Miseries and Their Remedies." At this gathering a detailed account will be given of the "Darkest England Scheme," showing its progress up to date.

During the week a conference has been held at the rooms of the lleform Club, Melbourne, of representatives irom the National Association of New South Woles, the National Defence League of South Australia, and the National Liberal League of Victoria to diBcusa the possibility of a federation or affiliation ot those and kindred organisations for mutual assistance and support. The following delegates were present :-New South M'aies-Messrs. J. M. Punes (president), W. T. Poole (vice president), and W. Epps (secretary). South Australia-Messrs. J. Darling, jun , V. C. Howard (bon. treasurer), and M. Burgess (secretar) ) Victoria - Mr. W. Madden (president), Mr. J. M'Meikan, and Mr G. K. Bald (secretar)). Mr. Vi. Madden was elected president of tho confer- ence, and Mr. Purves v ice president. It was unanimously decided to recommend to the varions associations in sympathy with the movement a scheme of affiliation em- bracing the adoption of a common name and aet of general objects for all the organisa- tions, and as far as possible a common plat- form, with the proviso that each association might amplify the title and objects to meet ita local conditions, and retain control of its own membership, tunda, and organisation. The schimc will be submitted to the various organisations for adoption or otherwise. In September last J A.
