MONDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1887. A want of modesty is a fault of which no one will accuse the members of the Trades-hall. The last intima- tion that the council of that body has given of a high opinion of its own claims and position is the resolution arrived at that Ministers shall be invited to appoint two of the members of the council as commissioners upon the Harbour Trust. That body is consti- tuted as was prescribed by law after a careful consideration of the case. The Government appoint five members, the owners of Melbourne ships three, the merchants and traders using the wharves three, the City Council two, and the municipalities of Port Mel- bourne, South Melbourne, Williams- town, and Footscray each one. In this way all the interests which the Legislature thought ought to be specially represented are provided for. The object in authorising the Govern- ment to directly appoint so many com- missioners was not, of course, to permit of interests and bodies not named in the act — interests and bodies excluded by the Legislature — coming in by a side way, but was to allow of men of weight and of special knowledge being intro- duced to the Trust on behalf of the com- munity as a whole. The Legislature can say any day, if it so pleases, that the Trades-hall shall have two representatives on the Trust, and it can say, it it pleases, that the Employers' Union shall have two ; but, in the absence of the Legislature, it is hardly for the Government to allot commissioners to the one body or the other. If the Government give the Trades-hall two commissioners there would be only three public commis- sioners left. If it gave the Employers' Union two also — as in common fairness it would be bound to do — why only one public commissioner would remain, and perhaps the Employes' Early-closing Association would lay claim to this one, and the community would then be altogether unrepresented as a com- munity, the wishes and direction of Parliament notwithstanding. The Go- vernment does not hold this power of appointing commissioners in trust for any section of the people, but for the people as a whole. The origin of the movement is no secret. The Harbour Trust has had under its notice the propriety or other- wise of adopting the rule in force throughout Great Britain that " time " shall not run against the contractor " when the delay in completing the " works is solely due to strikes or lock- " outs." All that need be said is that the Harbour Trust as it stands is a per- fectly competent tribunal to decide such an issue. The Trust patiently heard both sides. A deputation from the Trades-hall Council was introduced, and advanced all that could be said on behalf of the workmen, and a deputa- tion from the Employers' Association said all, probably, that could be urged by the contractors. The point, in fact, was submitted to arbitration, and what has caused the Trades-hall Council to be annoyed is that the arbitration went against them, and under these circum- stances they resort to the common tactics of reviling the Court — or aspersing the jury. Yet the decision is the one which common sense, fair play, and the public interest alike demand. The desire of the Trust is to stand neutral—to let men and masters arrange matters for themselves. The Trust is not neutral when it says " the contract must be fulfilled in the " stated time, whether the workmen " are willing to go on or not," for it obviously places in the hands of the men a screw which they can turn as against their employers at pleasure. But the Trust is neutral when it says, as it now proposes to do, " Settle " your differences as you please, and " then go on as before." Nothing can be more offensive to any employer than that his contractor and the workmen should quarrel. Still he owes a duty to society not to take sides in the dispute, and, moreover, he has to con- sider his own position and to protect himself. If he insists that the con- tractor shall proceed, no matter what the hostile combination may be against him, he must expect that the con- tractor will charge "a strike risk" in order to secure himself, and that the cost of construction will thus be largely increased. The Trades-hall Council would gain nothing, as we have said, by inducing the Government to give it two delegates. The Employers' Union would demand a similar number, and then the Trades- hall vote would be neutralised. As matters now stand, neither the labourers are directly represented on the trust nor are the contractors, but both go before a thoroughly impartial body, and this is the arrangement which should obtain. This appointment of delegates would, moreover, do much to lower the status of the Trust, and we regret to say that, even as it is, the Trust has not the men whom it started with. There baa been a falling off where, looking at the work to be accomplished, it was important that there should be an improvement. Delegates from the Trades-hall would give expression, no doubt, to the feelings of a particular class about the often paltry disputes of the hour, but what the community requires is the presence of men who can take a broad view and a firm grasp of the im- portant questions of engineering and of financial management that have to be faced. Dealing with the case as a whole, we submit that Ministers are not entitled to change the composition of the Harbour Trust as the Trades-hall, in its wisdom, has seen fit to pro- pose, and that the reply to any and all such applications must be that any body seeking direct representation must obtain the necessary authority from Parliament. The Executive administers tile law. The proposal of the Trades- hall Council is that the Executive should amend it. The instance of oppression which has reached us from Fiji, through the Rev. FREDERICK LANGHAM, is not to be re- garded simply as an isolated case of cruelty which might be fully redressed by the punishment of the offenders. It suggests, in reality, two wide and important questions. The first is whether the administration of the law in Fiji is as effective and philanthropic as it has been usually described ; and the second, whether a form of native government, under which semi- civilised chiefs are permitted to wield arbitrary powers over their fellow countrymen, should be toler- ated in a British colony. The facts which Mr. LANGHAM has published in our columns are brutal in their nature, and the manner in which they have apparently been shirked is discreditable to the Government. A Fijian, whose garden had been wantonly pillaged, addressed a remonstrance to the chiefs of the district under whose pro- tection he was supposed to be placed. For the incomprehensible offence of writing this letter of complaint, he was at once summoned before his indignant superiors and pub- licly flogged ; and that in spite of his expressed desire to have the whole matter submitted to the judgment of the nearest English magistrate. No explanation was asked, and the victim was summarily punished for the sole crime of daring to complain about the loss and destruction of his property. A worse instance of injustice and high- handedness could hardly be imagined. But disgraceful as the story is, there is no room to doubt its truth, since the Acting Governor, Mr. THURSTON, has pro- nounced it upon inquiry to be sub- stantially correct. Mr. THURSTON is in a position to learn the exact truth from the natives, and he would never have suffered a slur to be cast upon the work- ing of the famous native scheme unless the alleged facts had been thoroughly demonstrated. The reprehensible part of the affair, however, is to be found not so much in the cruelty of a few chiefs as in the conduct of the European officials. The incident shows that the supervision of the native towns is managed with an astonishing and culpable laxity. We have before had ample occasion to doubt the often-repeated statements that the commoners are fully protected, and that Fiji is a model to all the world for the government of black races ; and the present case shows, with unmistakable emphasis, that in spite of official assertions, the power of the chiefs is practically unchecked. The Native Commissioner professed himself to be totally ignorant regarding the outrage. His officers had never heard of the occurrence until they were informed of it by Mr. LANG- HAM. The English magistrate of the district was utterly unaware that such a thing had been done within five miles of his residence. Not one of the Government officials seems to have known anything of an event that occurred openly in the presence of a large number of people, and but for the exertions of the missionary, the victim would have carried the marks of his ill-treatment to the grave without the slightest hope of finding redress. So far as the officials were concerned, the affair would never have been known ; and it is now impossible to tell how many cases of injustice may happen under their very eyes. It is evident, at least, that there is not the smallest vigilance on their part, and oppression, therefore, may be common without being reported. If such flagrant cruelty can pass unnoticed, no proper supervision can be exercised over the chiefs, and we are justified in fearing that a hundred potty annoyances may be inflicted by them upon their subjects. The Govern- ment zeal for the native, which refuses to trust him to the care of a planter, stops short at his own town, and leaves him at the mercy of his tribal ruler. The plantations are constantly visited by inspectors, the labourers questioned, the books examined, and the managers are liable to punishment for the infringement of the most minute of the many minute rules which regulate the employment of blacks by Europeans. The inspectors, however, do not seem to find their way to the villages, where they might dis- cover that the broad, principles of jus- tice are sometimes violated. But the laxity does not end here. The case was reported to Mr. THURSTON, who undertook to " deal " with it him- self. The astonishing thing, however, is that no one can discover what his " dealing" has been. "Twelve weeks " have elapsed," says Mr. LANGHAM, " since I brought the case before the " Government, and I cannot learn that " any police proceedings have been " instigated, or that any of the officials " concerned have been dealt with, or that " any public expression of disapproval " has been given by His Honour the " Administrator." Only one conclusion can be formed. Mr. THURSTON must have resolved to let the case pass over without a word of censure, either on the chiefs for their cruelty, or on his officers for their neglect. If a planter had been guilty of a far less serious offence, he would have been promptly dragged before the law courts and sentenced. Some sacredness, how- ever, seems to surround a chief, which prevents him from being exposed to the degradation of punishment. The Administrator has plainly no wish to interfere in native disputes, even when his influence would shield the commoner from oppression. But his inaction, which in the present instance is inexplicable and inexcusable, is bound to lead to untoward results It is in effect an approval of what has been done, and will encourage the chiefs to be more high handed, and the officers to be more indolent. The cause of this unsatisfactory state of affairs must be ascribed partly to the system introduced by Sir ARTHUR GORDON, and continued by his successor. The government of Fiji is through the chiefs and by the chiefs, who still retain many arbitrary powers. Acts of op- pression, therefore, are probably neither few nor uncommon. It has been said that money due to the villagers is fre- quently appropriated by the chiefs, that the commoners are often unfairly punished, that they are taken away from their own employment to build houses or boats for the chiefs, and that they are compelled to work for nothing. Not one of these assertions has ever been satisfactorily rebutted, and it is not probable that any of them can be completely denied. Nothing else could be expected from the plan of leaving their traditional powers in the hands of the chiefs, simply to be in accordance with native custom. It might have been unwise to abolish all the native customs, but it has been equally unwise to continue some of them that are inconsistent with good and just government. The system has been tried for ten years without finding favour save in official circles, and an effort should now be made to alter the unfair and unequal tribal relationships. If the injustice of which Mr. LANGHAM'S Fijian friend has been the victim helps to bring about this result, he will have suffered for the benefit of the humbler classes of his countrymen. All that the officers of the Yin Yean department have to sty upon the subject of water is read with avidity by the public They have been at pains re- cently to explain the situation very fully to the community, and if the householder with no water has studied the literature of the office with due attention, he has the melancholy satisfaction of knowing how it is that he is deprived of that necessity. The explanation reduces itself to this:— 1. Too much water is wasted. 2\. Not enough water is stored near the city. A check upon inordinate consump- tion is very necessary, but it is also equally important that the local storage should be largely increased.
