REVIEW. I UNORTHODOX LONDON. I Mw hos sought out many inventions, is «n axiom found true in evcrj department of life, and none the hssin nligion r.vcn had not this fact hoon self evident from the time that the serpent whispered heresy to our hrst parent, it would beproved by tho volume 1) ing before us. " Unorthodox London ' is a work by the Rev Maurice Davies, who, after noting the diverse shades of opinion that like many featured brothers and sisters shelter themselves under the one family name of "Church of England, ' proceeds to examine their cousins the Otherwise- thinkers These he names unorthodox, simply on the principle that "orthodoxy is one's own doxy, and heterodoxy everybody else's doxy," and he strives throughout to suppress his own convictions of the re- lative value of the -various forms of worship, and to give each a fair field and no favour To an earnest seeker after truth there is something inexpressibly sad in tho list of sects which stand at tho beginning of the book There is " One God, one faith, one baptism,' saith Holy Writ, yet here are more than forty different ways of worshipping that God, forty faiths, and almost as many forms of baptism! Each body has its own prophet, who verily speaks in his own tongue, and, like Greek of old, looks on all other languages as Barbarian—each be- lieves that his one hand alone has grasp of the truth, that his only feet are on the road to salvation-all are in earnest, and yet—? Some one must be mis- taken, and who is it? "Not you or I, of course, brother," we say , and still, even while we condemn the creed of another, there comes on unacknowledged fear that their reason is as strong as ours, and that, after all, it may be our infallible selves who are going astray. It is a terrible consideration, and we must only seek comfort in the thought that, though none of us know where lies the exact point of truth, all those different forms may be radiations from the same centre, or systems revolving in different orbits round the same sun. Hut let us now turn from reflections which oin never fii d end or nnsw er, to the actual places ol worbhip described bj Mr Davies in his explorations through the religious world, from the "north polo of Nonconformiij to the torrid regions of Romanism " Iho firstvisitwns to ihc South Place Chapel, where Mr. Moncure Conway weekly expounds tho doc trines of pure theism strongly flavoured with Rationalism Mr Conway-who, by tho way, described himself to the reviewer as one of the members of the socialistic community formed by Emerson, and portrayed by Hawthorne in the Blythe dale Romance-is certainly original in his method of ministering There was, much singing and preaching, three lessons read out-two from Scripture, and one from "some religious work of more modern date," but no opprooeh to anj mode of prajer The sermon consisted of a vindication of misunderstood persons and words, such as "Voltaire" and "sceptic, ' and pointed out the necessity for tho destructive as well as constructive work in religion Much more instructive and beautiful was the next discourse in the some chapel On tihs occasion Colonel Wentworth Higginson gave a lecture on Buddhism. As we read the simple record of self devotion, we are struck with the resemblance between the great leader and our own Messiah The Son of God left a heavenly throne to take upon him poverty and suffering, and went forth to teach tho outcast. Buddha was the son of a king, who guarded him from a knowledge of pain or death But the sight of an aged man awoke his mind to the ravages of time, death, defying the sentinels, entered the palace, and a monk inflamed the prince's desire to give up all for religion Not the tie of wife and child, though tender and strong, could hold him back, and he left the city,in the garb of a beggar, to endure the life of an ascetic First came the years of preparation, the attacks of evil spirits in tho forest, and then he entered upon his work. Truly "with self-renunciation his life began."* Many are the martyrs who would give up the pleasures of this world, beung sure of the salva- tion to come. But with Buddha the sacrifice was yet more grand " Caste stood in his way. In the lowest class were those who exercised the callings of executioners and grave diggers By no process of transmigration would they be reborn Buddha stepped down from tho palaco to as ouato with these He took tho yellow robe of those poor beggars If he was wrong, tho mistake would not simply attach to this life, but at tho next transmigration he would become tho meanest insect. So much did it cost to ignore caste in Hindostan Buddha and his followers said nothing against caste, but they denied it in practice Ihe went to Benares, the sacred city, and preached to tho poor in tho fields Afterwards he returned to his palace, and found that his wife had taken tho same course as himself Then other female members of his family fol- lowed, and finally 500 women came to tho monastery, and made him receive them as fellow-workers This institu- tion of Buddhism has lasted over 2000 years, and even a roman Catholic bishop has said that Buddhism equalized women with man "The grand characteristic of Buddha's preaching may be summarized in this one maxim-' If a man does me wrong, and I respond with love, tho fragrance redounds to me, tho harm returns to him ' Buddha (Guatama or Sakya Mouni) began preaching at thirty-five years of age, and preached for forty-two years, dying at tho age of eighty, in tho arms of his disciples ' It would be impossible to follow the author through all hid peregrinations After listening to the rev James Martineau, the exponent of the highest "Unitarianism, he passes on to Mr. Voysey, the sub- ject of so much legal and newspaper warfare, who, after being prosecuted into a hero by tho Church of England, had, like Dickens's "Little Joe," been re quested to "move on," till he became a sort of religious Arab belonging everywhere and nowhere, and preaching in whichever camp would give him shelter. Evidently with some secret scruples, and encou- raged by the names of a few brother-reverends giving countenance to a circular sent by the Sunday Lectures Society, Mr. Davies repaired to St. James's Hall, where the weekly meetings were held. Here was no pretence of worship, but Irofessor Huxley gave a lec- ture on the " Forefathers of the English people on the Mainland of Europe and Asia." Most interesting was the subject, the opinions much newer than those usually heard on a Sunday ; but there was nothing to lead the thoughts to God ; and though the blending of human leurning and Divino would, without doubt, prove most beneficial to both, one fears the thin edge of tho wedge. On this subject the writer says : "It is against unmitigated Sabbatarianism, and this only, that tho society desire to protest. They carefully avoid all theological subjects ; but they hold that history, literature, and art, especially in their bearing on tho social well-being of mankind are proper subjects for Sunday study. It would be difficult to assail such a position-very difficult to say whero the practical sermon merges into tho lecture. Then, again, the persons who attended tho lecture, ono could see at a glance, were not the peoplo who go to church, or are likely to do so until the calibre of tho clergy and the style of sermons are widely different from tho present. We may yet see tho day when those who go to church in tho morning, and perchanco tbo evening, too, may yet find time in tho afternoon for such an interesting disquisi- tion." Very different was the next phase observed in tho Tabernacle, where Mr. Spurgeon collects his thou- sands of listeners. We are accustomed to hear much of the eccentricities of this preacher, but on this occasion none were exhibited. He did no1 illustrate the parable by sliding down the rails of the pulpit, and there was not an approach to Spurgeonism except the assurance that we "could not go to Heaven on a feather-bed." Certainly he does not appear to be the " sounding brass " man that is often supposed. Deeds even more than words seem to be his motto ; and this was proved to Mr. Davies by a view of the orphanage, almshouses, and schools. "Thence I passed to the Tabernacle itself. Now, I fancy moat peoploe have an idea that this is a ' preaching shop,' closed and doing nothing from Sunday to Sunday. Never was there a greater mistake. It is a perfect hive of busy workers from 7 every morning till night.

Particular Baptist-, United Presbyterians, who are too well known in our midst to need description Of the Catholic Baptists Church the notice is so sketchy that the author does not seem to have grasped the beauty of their creed. This is cnnncntlv eclietn, being an attempt to take the best points out ot ever) form of worship, adding n btlief in the direct toicc, and second outpouring of the Spirit, and the renewal of the Apostolate in the persons of twelve scared) known men, who, Uko unto the first, were special!) called and seit forth with the Divino message Ihe) also expect and daily pra) for the second advent ot our Lord, nnd their bishops and paBtors bear the ancient titles of angel and archangel, names whith have evoked much ridicule from those who do not understand their true derivation and significance The New Jerusalem or Swedenborgian Church has lately become known in Sydney through the minis- trations of one of its missionary bishops " Speaking broadly, we may say that this creed super adds to highly rationalistic views of tho Trinity and Atonement a highly allegorizing method of scriptural interpretation, and with regard to Swedenborg himself and his revelation, views almost identical with modern spiritualism Swedenborg had tho power of inducing, in his own case, a state clearly tho same as what we now call mesmerism ' In this state spirits are seen, heard, and touched ' The resurrection of tho dead is immediate Íhere being no pause or suspension of existence, tho fleshly body is cast aside once for all and never reassumed—a spiritual body, being the true self that survives Sex remains, and marriages are consummated in heaven In fact tho spirit-world is but tho region of realities whereof all things here are tho phenomena ' One of the customs observed by this sect is no' men- tioned by the author,-that of wearing no mourning for the departed So real is their perception of the life spiritual, that they will not show the ordinary signs of grief, but rather rejoice that the soul has reached the higher world "Wo could almost wish that this ldei were more widely adopted No doubt there is a comfort in nssuming the sable garb wIhch expresses our sorrow , but how often is it turned into a mookery ? How pre valent the tendenev to lay aside the memory with the b'nek , and how frequently is it considered an inflic- tion, and murmured at in a way that would scarcely grattiy tile dear one for whose sake we put it on ' And at the best, how terrible it is, even while the loved form lies silent in the upper chamber-when in the hallowed hush of death, all our mind should be tuned to holier thoughts, to have to consult with tho dressmaker over mode nnd pattern, to measure our relationship by the depth of crepe, and our grief by the texture of the bombazine ! Surely it would be better to cherish the memory, not for a conventional peiiod, but for God's own time, in our hearts alone ' In latter days of hurrv nnd much talking, most refreshing must have been the Quaker's Meeting, where 150 elders, and even boys, sat under the spell of a religious silence " At 11 o clock our silent 6ervico commenced Tho on!) outward and vinblo tign that it had bogun was tho siniul tnneous remov al of hats on tho part of tho congreg ition, then, for an hour, thero was silence Ibero was no fidgeting ov cn on tho part of thoso marvellous bojs, and lhere w as coneiderablv less coughing than, I feel curtain, would havo been tho caso in an) other meeting Ono bj ono covered their faces with thoir hands and engaged in silent pmjer, still retaining the Bitting poulton, which was never changed through tho cntiro proceedings I had quite migrated lo dreamland, when tho Blow and measured ucconts of a lady who was occup)ing the centra of tho raised suata roused mo from my rev ino.

' The worship of the Sandemnnians or Glassites (founded by John Glass and Robert Sandeinan) seems to have been far from cheerful. It consisted of the alternate singing of a lugubrious psalm and a prayer by one of the seven ministers of the day, this continuing till each had lifted up his voice. There are, however, other services-the Agnpie, or love feasts-which must be more congenial to tne youthful Glassites. " Tho design of tho feast, they say, ' is to cultivato mutual knowledgo and friendship, to testify that all are brethren of ono family, and to próvido that the poor may have a comfortable mool at tho oxpenso of the moro wealthy. TMB and other opportunities wo tako for the kiss of charity, or tho saluting of each othor with a holy kiss-a duty most expressly cxhortod to no loss than five times in tho Now Testament.' At the lovo-feast each member salutes tho person that sits next to him on each side. A dclicato work indeed would souiotiuios bo that of placing tho brethren and stoters, if it wera not ruled that they should take their soafs by lot, for tho Sondoinaniana regard tho lot us Bacred." Scarcely coming under the head of religion - though, ii true, strongly bearing upon it-are the Spiritist Manifestations which have of late years taken the place of the witchcraft of olden times. Now, how- ever, instead of an old hog with a broomstick, per- forming secret rites in lonely wilds, lady and gentle- men mediums hold drawing-room séances, and know no fear of the witches' fire, though they evince a strong objection to gaslight.
