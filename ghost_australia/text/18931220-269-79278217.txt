Billy was an eccentric character, and in wild blacks' country, travelled in an astonishing costume, in which h«t, shirt and trousers were fiery red, made out of some sort of scarlet material, which made him Irok like a perambu lating pillar of flame. - Many of the myalls bad seen white'men before, but never one like Brigalow Billy, nod so they either took him for a lunatic or evil spirit, and kept at least two miles { out of his line of march. And on Chiistmas day 1861, Billy satdown to eat his dinner by the side of Lake JSalvator. Within 200 y«rds of where he sat were three blacks camps but the inhabitants had fled at the first glimpse of that awful scarlet appari tion armed with fcwo'double-barrelled duelling pistols and a double barrleled shot gun. All fled except one tall stately old man with sn >w white hair. He marched down to Billy without the slightest pign of fear, and sat down on a rock not three yards a* ay, holding in his right hand a small green bnsh bnstowed cm the cpring created rivfr that rises in the basalt rocks of Buirkland'ti fab I eland. Billy spoke 'he Kamilamy dialect of the N&moi; apd be and. the ancient warrior fairly understood each other other, assisted by the gesture language, which to a t»:arkfelIow is Just as "expressive as words. Brigatow Biliy l< v d the savage, loved him for his litateij walk, l«in physical health, bin plain food, his wild fr^e noble hnn er'» lite, bis skill with his weapon*, his u< crni manisin, his pditen ss and his hospitality, for the wild black possessed all these a*tributes and was as brave a6 a lion. At right ftboaf 50 blacks assembled ami held « corrobbor» e in honor of Billy, i he eoog W36 extemporised by the loral bard and referred to Billy's physical strength, his grey eyes, his long moustache, h s wo derfal gun and pistol, and -b<»ve a 1 his flame co'oird costume, which was regards! a« a supernatural production and doubt less endowed t"e pot*s»asor with divine powers. Then Billy sang an old in tae daytime. His stomach, is seldom. in working order, and lie u always looking and longing for some thing that be don't want «n*i makes no use of when tie gets it. He crowds himse'f into filthy cities, preys on his fehow in&n; like a vampire, and worries his miserable soul over religion and politics and such like cussed foolishness until hit) life ain't worth livin'. Noble myalls! Tins civilized human kookaburra calls you degraded savages and starts to wipe yon ont! Well, by the ghost of Bri*n Boruo if you were only half as de graded and contemptible as as he is, you ought to be wiped out like a cockroach !" Billy said be talked for half an hoar in that strain to an appreciative audience. And next morning three of the oldest men joined him on his journey to show him the way to the 'op of the range. On the summit of Mitchell's M*. Faraday the blanks pointed to the south-east and gave Billy clearly to understand that the nearest white man was a long long way off, across manyj i vero^nd ranges, and brigalow . station in 1656, the year of the C»n< ona rush. . . . * I " tbe year 1881 two Ohartewi | Towers men. Cooper and Mills, took up two selections on Liverpool Creek, a st*eam running into Kockhaanptoa Bay. Three months afterwards I went up that creek accompanied by Charley M**«ret, Frank Sam mere and a Palm IsJaad bl ckboy. We were attacked by a mob of about 50 blacks armed with wooden swords and woome a spear-. - What happened o no part of < his narrative. Tbe Palm Island boy found the track of a white man and ran it up for half a mile nit til he found the body of a man lying face downwards on & flat rock, three spearn sticking in his hock. He had stood on the rock to look round and the blacks had sp**ared him from the shelter of a small gully in the rear. The wounded man had turned in a final eff- rt ao l shot two of the blacks who were lying not 25 yards away. Those were the shots we had heard an hour before. That white mam was " Brtgalow Billy." He had been in token of peace, a custom prevalent among the Australian blacks. Billy walked up <o the old warrior and each pot bis left hand on the others head. Then the aged myall by expressive gestures described Sir Thomas Mitchell's visit in 1846, the number of men and yarramans, the direction he came aud the way he went, the size of the dray and the way the wheels went round. Then Billy gave him a scrub turkey, " wahgoon," and|h« pro ceed to pluck and roa-t the bird, while Billy cooked a couple of won^as and grilled a fish he had shot on the edge ef the water. For Salvator is a perfect paradise for sportsmen, a»'d game of any kind is in lavish abun dance. It is also one of the loveliest and most romantic spots in Queens land. No wonder the artistic eye of Mitchell perceived in that beautiful region a splendid picture such as would have charmed the wild Italian painter Salvator Rosa whose glorious landscapes have never been excelled. And the name of the gentle Claude, not less renowned than Rosa, he Kamilaroy song beginning: Yo! yo! ¥ ebbar-an-doh ! Daigo dahro yebbar-an-doh! Weeri weeli dahngo doh ! Yo! yo! yebbar-an-doh ! I on til the blacks shrieked with laughter and rolled on the ground with frenzied hilarity. I heard Billy sing that song with appropriate gesture* in 187S#, and it was cnoauh to bring tears to th** eye of a gabiroo. Then Billy stood up on a rock and delivered an impa*si' ned speech to which the m\alls listened with pro found astonishment though they didn't understand a single word. . Billy told me in after years it ran something like this;-" Noble savages, | noble hunters, free eouled children of . nature, you are warriors, you are men ; you are philosophers! Compared to you the white man is a wooden-headed ass! He toils and slaves from youth to old age, for ever at war with creditors, and bailiffs, and lawyers, and over drafts, and other abominations of this blasted civilization until he can neither sleep at night nor he at peace scrubs, and Billy would have to ran the gaanlet of many tribes of * wild blacks,' (for all blacks axe - wild, except those to whom you are talking,) and all things considered, they thought it * hardly good enough ' for Billy to travel in that direction. So Billy sat on a rock on the crest of Faraday, and after due deliberation, a» rived at the same sensible con clusion. Accordingly he went back to Lake Salvator, stayed three weeks with the blacks, and then started on the back track carrying a message stick, on which the circular marks and the outline of a shield indicated that the bearer was a friend of all blacks whom he chanced to meet. And word was sent on from tribe to tribe, and Billy kept clear of the Pioneer stations and the vicinity of any "blasted civili zaation," until he struck the Dawson at Kianga where he made a bottle tree canoe in which he went down te Bockhampton like McLeod, Emmons, Dinniney, and McKinlay from Rio looking for a good selection, and hud found it, for be was at last far outside of " this here blasted civilization !" £THE END.] ?
