TEE S.A.J.C. MEETING. [By Telegraph. 1 [From our own Reporter. 1 Melbourne, -vlay 1, Afternoon. Beyond a good Cup gallop by Sardius there was not much work done this morning. The I betting market is brisker, Anchorite, St. John. Lord Wilton, and Tineas all beinz backed for the Goodwood Handicap to win a few hundreds, while the friends of Topaz are still willing to support their horse 'at any advance upon 100 to 30. For the Cnp Britisher is firm at 7 to 1 ; bat Prometheus has receded to 10 to 1, a price which can be had about any thing bar the Ballarat horse. Melbourne, May 1, 11.5 p.m. There was a crowded attendance at the Victorian Clab to- night, and some heavy speculation took place over the Goodwood Handicap. Lord Wilton was the first horse introduced, and he was quickly ba-cked down to 8 to 1, several thousands being taken. Ihia horEe is very well, and with Power in the saddle he will lose nothing in the matter of riding. After Topaz had receded to 4 to 1 his new owner came to his rescue, and in a few minutes the best offer became 5 to 2, while an offer to take £1,500' to £S00 did not meet with any response from the ring. Lantern was supported to win a good Etake, but he is not in favour with the pnblie, and 12 to 1 could have been had after the stable commission was executed. Anchorite, St. Lawrence, Uncas, St. John, and Duenna were all backed for small amounts : but the Adelaide horses carry the bulk of the money. For the Adelaide Cup Sardius was backed by the stable to win about £5,000 at hundreds to 10 and 12. The following are the prices : — OOCDWOOD HANDICAP. 5tolapst.
