MISCELLANEA. A PROVIDENTIAL APPARITION. The following (vouched for) appears in the 'Londoafievlew:- '^ In the year 1828, a Mr Robert Bruce was chief mate of ? barque trading from Liverpool to New Brunswick. When near tbe banks of New foundland, the captain and mate were one day calculating their progress — the mate in the state room, and tlie captain in the cabin near it. Being absorbed in his work. Bruce hod not cer ceived that the captain had gone on deck ; and, without looking round, he called out, ' I ninlve our longitude so-and-so ; can that be right ? How is vow's sir f '' Receiving no reply, he re peated the question, glancing over his shoulder, and perceiving, as he thought, the captain burr writing on his slate. Si: I! red i\ ing no answer, he rose, and fronted the cabiu door, when the figure lib had mistaken for the captain looked up, and disclosed the features of an entire stranger. Bruce, terrified at tbe grave aud silent gate, rushed upon deck, and the captain, of course, begged to know what was the matter. ' Tlie matter, sir, who is that at your desk ? ' No one, that 1 know of.' ' But there it, sir, tlere's a stranger there.'' ' A stranger ! why, man, you must be dreaming. You must have peen tbe steward there, or the second mate. Who elso would venture down without ordi-re ? ' ' But sir, be was sitting in your arm cliair, (routing the door, writing on your slate. Then he looked up full in my face, nml if ever 1 b;iw a man plainly and distinctly in this world, I raw him.'' ' Him I whom ? ' ' God knows, sir, I don't. I saw a man— and a man I had never seen in my life before.' ' You niuet be growing crazy, Sir. Bruce. A stranger ! and we nearly six week* out? ** ' I know, fir, but tlieu I saw him.' 'Go down, and see who it ia ' Buice hetitittedW ' I never was a believer in ghosto,' he »aidjs^feH| the truth must be told, tsir, 1 had^^^^^^^^H fuce it alone.

About three o'clock an ieeberg was descried, and afterwards » dismantled ship entangled in it, with many human beings on board. On a nearer approach she was found a mere wreck, her j.rovuions exhausted, and her crew and passengers nearly famished. Boats were sent for tl eir, and as one of the men from the third boat was ascending the ship's side, tbe nat« started back in confusion — for it was the face, tbe person, tfce dress of him be had seen at the captain's desk three or four hours before. Whea the bnrry waa over, and the barque wat on her coarse again, tbe mate called the captain aaids. . ' Itaeems it waanota ghost [ saw today, air. The man's alive. One of the passengers we bav« jmtt saved is tbe same man I saw writing on yo«r slate at noon. I would swear to it in a court ef jsMtke.'* Together they sought out tbe man ; and the captain, inviting him down iuto tbe cabin, begged lie would do him the favour to write on tbealate. 'Sspposs you wrice 'Steer to the sjor*-westl'* The paserager, greatly pnasled at the teqtMat, complied nevetthdesa.
