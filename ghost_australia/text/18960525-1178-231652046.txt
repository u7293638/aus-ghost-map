Tho wondrous and perfect lovo of our Saviour lniiBt ho their type o£. charity and their model in extend ing charity to thoso around them. One feature of this charity was that they should extend their charity to those who wero not of the Catholic faith. Ono dis tinguished English statesman had said, "To servo Christ and Christianity was tho inoBl! heroic deed that man could accorn- plish in our day." Ho wished that thoBO words wore emblazoned ill , overy Christian household. It might seem '. strange lie should say they must lova i thoso who wero not of the fold. Tlioy saw - around them those who misrepresented Catholic teachings and .calumniated tho Catholic Church. Tlioy wero really their brothers in arms — one with thorn in spirit. Tho people of tho Catholic communion should lovo tlioni, and pray that God would scud tliern grace to' seo tho beiiuty of Catholic truth, that Ho would gather them into the fold of tho one truo "Sliephord- and all become of ono faith. Tho choir rendered Haydn's " Imperial Mass," Mr. J. A. Dehmy being tho organist. Tho soloists wero Miss Stafford and Messrs. W. P. O'Hallorau, D. Clancy and Percy Bates. -
