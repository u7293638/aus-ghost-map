This club intended to hnre carried out a nnmber of evolutions on Saturday afternoon, as the pro gramme for the openiu? of the club tbe Volun teer Ghost, Oruce Darling, Fly-away, Violet, Cygnet and the Commodore's boat, Kunauook, met oft Clarke Island, but owing to the very strong breeze the evolutions had- to be abandoned, as most of the soats carried racing sails, which tended to make them a littlo too lively, and all the boats came to an anchorage. The prize for the boat which looked best was awarded to the Grace Darling, the crew of wliich well deserved the win, although the Volunteer ran her very close, but had a larger crew. The first race takes place under the auspices of this club next Saturday, the prize.mouey being Â£30.
