SUPERSTITIONS, HINDOO AND ENGLISH. The following stories of superstition are told by "E.A.K.," desoribing'in Temple Bar" the " WayB of tho East": One day an English magistrate was paying a visit 'to a Hindoo gentleman, who was an old friend of his, m the oooree of whioh he happened to yawn.- To his aetonirhment, np jomped the 'rajah as if gol- vanised, and began furiously snapping his fingers in startling proximity to his face. Ob serving bis -visitor's look of unfeigned surprise, be explained that this was done to soars away - the devils, wbo might otherwise seize the opportunity to jump down bis throat. How strange it seems to ns, this practical' belief in devils, and fear of them, combined with so in sultingly low an idea of their intelligence and power ! I onoo heard, however, an odd in- Btanooof the same few and yet oontempt for unseen powers-shown by an English lady in the beginning of this century— a bishop's wife, too! —who wak afraid of ghosts, and if left alone in the house wonld whistle as she walked through the passages at night in order that' the ghosts might take heritor 's man.
