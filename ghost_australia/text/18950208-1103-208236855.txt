I left soon after for Hsrittburg, and returning at the end of a week, I found the gallant Captain seated on a log, the interested spectator of a dual between Indian (ameoockt, both armed with mnrderou* blade*. Their ahackln stood out like enormous ruffles too long tail feathers drooped, aad the gleaming ere. fluhed like fire under the lleroe excitement of tbe battle. They met together in mid-air, there wu a acatternig of feathers, a fleroe thrust home, aad oae of tbe gallant little birda wa- ttretched out on oi. His owner, an elated coolie, picked him op, thmst a finger into tbe gaping wound, stitched the ends together, and placed tbe bird aside, where it staggered to ta feet, weak but valiant. ' 'Here ye see theepMesnof war,' said Fagui. ' These birds have no teal cause for enmity, they have no feathered harems to defend, or stores of golden grain, yetateommand tbeyrnsh to battle. Upon me word when ye seethe tragedy of glorious war played out in a cockpit it makes you weep.' His merriment of a few days back had given way to a fit of moralising.

'Aadawa member of one of the ouldest families in Oirelaod,' ;be exclaimed tragically. ' Ob. now, that father was unreasonable. Be said he wanted no one to offer him impertinent advice about bis daughter's education, and he had the blamed impudence to curse me and my ancestral home. 'Twas then the war broke out, and my . partiality for bananas and ripe lips received aoruel blow. Bee that pool of foul water on the flat P Well, I went straight off there to drown meself and me sorrows ; but there wu a prior claimant in the shape ofa poor diril of a bloated dog, and so I thought bettor of it and drowned the ultimatum instead.'
