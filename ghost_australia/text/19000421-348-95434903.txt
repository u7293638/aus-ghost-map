Mrs. Furnival. Mr. Furnival. Bur gvss. ; - Scene—Mrs. Furnival's Boudoir. Mrs. Furnival (in deep chair by firs) Charlie's late! Tbank good ness we aren't4 in the bill' anywhere to-night, and we can outrage all tbe proprieties. We won't dress for din ner, and Charlie shall smoke here; and I'M spend the evening making love to ray own husband. . . Yes. Burgess. (Enter Burgess with tele gram.) A. telegram! Detestable ! I might have known that something would . That will do, Burgess. (Exit Burgess-) I hate telegrams ! Of coarse, Charlie's detained. Some fool of a woman boring him with her mnddlcs. I hate a woman with a mental stutter! Disgusting colour— yellow! (Opens telogram.^ Oh, charming! Dinner at the Savoy, and the Lyeenm afterwards. Glorious 5 Dear boy! But how funnily it's worded. 'Dinner Savoy, seven sharp. Lyceum afterwards. Bring Patty.' What in the world does he mean 1 It is Patty ! Why, it's not from Charlie, after all. It's from that gold bag tied in the middle, the man Turnbull. And, of course, it's meant far Charlie, Patty, indeed ! insufferable impudence ! How dare he call me Patty ? It isn't even my name! There must be some. . . . Bring Patty. . . Bring . . . Patty. . . . Bring . . . Oh, not that! Dear God, not that! Oh, what shall I do ? What shall I do ? (Paces backwards and forwards; stops suddenly.) Shall I try it ? T must know. I must be sure. (Stands still for a moment; then presses bell.) (Enter Burges3.) Oh, Burgess, bring the pale-rose lamp shade, this horrid red thing hurts my eyes. And, Burgess, t< II Julie to put out my new tea-gown. And, Burgess, wheD I ring bring up the tea at once, and see that it is particularly good. And tell cook to be sere that the caviar sandwiches are as Mr. Furnival likes them. And put some of those baisers d'amour into the bonbonnierie. Tell Mr. Furnival that I will not be a moment. (Exit.) Burgess (alone): H'm! Now I wonder how much this cup of tea is going to cost Mr. Furnival ? (Exit,) Mr. Furnival (as he comes in): Maslge, Madge! Where are you? Hurry up, dear ! I am simply dying for a cup of your particular tea. (Mrs. Furnival comes in.) Jove! Madge—yon—you—look simply div ine this evening! (Steps forward. She eludes him and presses bell.) Mrs. Furnival: i This evening ! Rather crude, isu't it ? I was under the impression that I had a way of looking decent. I try to, for the credit of the family—and for—my lord's pleasure. Mr. Fuinival .* And there isn't such another woman in the world, and you know it, you sweet witch. (She curt seys.) Well, is that all I'm to have for my pretty speech ? Mrs. Furnival: Oh. no! You shall have a—a cup of my particular tea. Charlie!—Burgess! Mr. Furnival: Hang Burgess! (Sits down and kicks at fender stool.) (Burgess arranges tea equipage and exit.) Mrs. Furnival: Come, Charlie, here's your tea j&st; as you Iik« it. You look dreadfully tired you poor boy. Been worried much to-day ? Mr, Furnival (taking tea and with a keen look at her): Not par ticularly. 'Tisn't that. Mrs. Furnival: What is it then? Quick—I mean is it anything I crtn do ? I won't say a word, and, per haps, you'd feel better if you told me everything. « Mr. Furnival': Oh, it's nothing. At least, if you don't' know what's the matter, I don't Mrs. Furnival: Why, the dear boy is a positive enigma. But I think^I rather like a mysterious grief. (Mr. Furnival moodily stirs his tea.) You poor, \\\ orried old man. Drink your tea, and let me play to you. Mr. Furnival: No, thanks. My— my head aches. Mrs. Furnival: Oh, Charlie, I am sorry. Let me ring for some Eau de Cologne. Mr. Furnival: H'm ! Look here Madge, I can't stand this ! What have I done ? Mrs. Furnival: Oh, nothing, I sup pose. That is to say: you haven't drunk your tea, you haven't touched anything, not even those nice sweets which I had up spocially for you, Mr. Furnival: Oh, hang the sweets! I beg your pardon, but conf Fyoci know what I mean, perfectly well. Don't say you don't, or you will make me more miserable than I am already. Madge dear, pitch into me. Say anything you like, only for goodness sake,, don't sit there so demure and pretty, and so inapproachable. Well there, I'm sorry. Upon my soul I don't know what I've done, but whatever it is, I'm sorry. Mrs. Furnival: Poor boy ! But why should you be sorry. I hope you are not going to be ill, for then I should be sorry. Is the light too j strong for your eyes ? Let me turn it down. Mr. Furnival: Very well, Madge. If you are determined to have it so, so it must be. Only it's the first time we've—I mean it's the first time you've ever been like this, and I can't make it out, that's all. I'm a blunder ing idiot, and don't understand women a little bit—never did. But when a man's made like me he doesn't want his wife's tea or her sweets; he wants her. That plain enough. Mrs. Furnival: It's very nice! (Sinks back in her chair and 'fans herself gently). But you've got me surely! Here I am, very mnch here !e Mr. Fnrnival (starts forward, sh sits up, he sinks back again) : Oh, yes ; yon're there, and I'm here. And you might as well be at—the North Pole. Mrs. Furnival: No, really. De cidedly^ you are mysterious, but you are not amusing. Mr. Fnrnival -. Amusing ! Madge, tell me how I have oflcnded yon. Upon my honour as a gentleman, 1 hardly know what any other woman looks like, or what she wears, if thaiV it. You'*e been the sweetest and light of my- life hitherto. To-night you might- be wood, stone, a beauti ful automaton shut np in a glass box for all that I can get at you. Mrs. Furnival: then suppose we change the subject:— * * Then tcach me to fiirt a fan, the Spanish ladies can,' Don't yon think this one/ saita my. colouring admirably? (Lays it against her cheek.) What would Mr Tarnbull say, I wonder? Mr. Purnival: Turnbull! What the d— I mean, what on earth d« you mean ? Mrs.Farnival: Nothing! If you doht. I don't. Mr. Furnival: I only know it wouldn't take mach of this to break my heart. Mrs. Furnival«A broken heart and a mocking tongue.' But isri't this just a little tragic! Mr. Farnival: Tragic! Jnsi as yon phase. By the way, we haven't any engagement to-night—no. Then if yon have no objection I'll—I'll look in at the club for an hour or two, Mrs. Furnival: By all means ; but yoa won't 6nd Mr. Tarnbull there. Mr. Furnival: Oh, Tarnbull be (starts to his feet). What has he to do with it, anyhow 1 And what do yoa know of his goings and com ings. (Takes her hand and draws her to her feet). No, Madge, that won't do. Look at me. Look at me in the face. Yon have said too much —or not enough. What has Turn j bull been saying to you ? By heavens, if he has dared so mucb as to look at you, I'll wring his ugly little •neck. Mrs. Furnival: Better, mnch better 1 But it isn't his sayiug, it's your doing. Mr. Furnival: My doing ? Good ——Madge, once more, will yoa speak out ? Mrs. Furnival: How can I when you look at me like that ? Oh, well,, it's only that you ana he—Mr. Tarn bull, I mean—that—that—Charlie, you . No. I don't believe yoa could do it. Charlie, I'm not really wooden, ami? . . (Starling from him). It is of no use ; you cannot lay a ghost so. Charlie, I must be quite certain. What is this secret between you and Mr. Tarnbull ? Ah ! don't look at me with those eyes! Don't touch me! It is truej it is true. 1 Mr. Furnival: True ? Madge, are you . . Mrs. Farnival; Ob, I ssc it all now. And you thought to cheat me with a few cheap kisses. You were uneasy ot my seeming coldness. Charlie, how could you ? I did love you so! And you dared to dream of going to her. with my kis-» warm on your lips. Miserable! cowardly [ Mr. Furnival: Her? What her ? Why, this is ten times worse than the other! Madge. I swear to you Mrs. Furnival : No, no—not that ! It's bad enough without that. And I believed in this man's honour. Ho was next my God ! Oh, oh ! Mr. Furnival. Madge, hear me. I charge you; answer me. Who and what is this woman of whom yoa are raving ? Mrs. Farnival: Hear him ! He asks me who she is ! As if I knew! Such a name, too ! The common jest of his friends ! Bring Patty ! Oh, the shame of it! Mr. Furnival: Her name is Patty then. Perhaps it does not matter, but if you care to know, I pledge my solqmn word—— Mrs. Furnival: Hush, Charles, you must not! Read, Tead. (Thrusting telegram into nis hand.) . Oh that i ever I was born. (Sinks into chair, covers her face.) Mr. Furnival (reads,): Dinner Savoy, 7 sharp; Lyceum afterwards. Bring Patty. Oh, Lord! Oh ! ho, ha, ha, ha! (Falls into chair in paraxysm of laughter). Mrs. Furnival looks at him, bursts into tears. Mr. Fnrnival (throwing himself at her feet): Don't Madge, don'fc my darling. My dearest. It's all right —on my soal it is? Do listen for a moment. It's all a stupid mistake. Tarnbull wants his head punched. Will you listen, only for. a moment ? Mrs, Furnival (sobbing): Yes, Charlie—quick, quick. Mr. Furnival: Turnbull is my brother, you know. I wanted him to sell some stock for me, Do you un derstand ? Mrs. Furnival: Go on ; quick, I quick? Mr.Farnival: Well, I missed him this morning, and so he wanted me to meet him to-nigbfc at dinner and bring the paper with me, the paper that gives him Dower to sell—Power of Attorney. Patty is short for Power of Attorney. Don't you see ? Mrs. Furnival: Bat, ob, Charlie, Charlie ! . . . (Starting up). But it's 6 o'clock now, and we shall never get there in time; he says 7 sharp. And, of course, it's important.' Ho w you must hate me for being such a fool! Mr. Furnival: Hate you ? Looks like it. Besides, you can't go out after this. Mrs. Furnival: Can't I ? Why, I could dance all the way ! Go along and don your armour. Oh, what a fool! (They go out). Mr. Farnival (within): I say, come and do my necktie—-Patty!— L. W. M., in " Black and White.''
