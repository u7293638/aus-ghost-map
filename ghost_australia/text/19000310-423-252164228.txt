One Shilling Pops. The first of a series of popular concerts will be given on Tuesday, 27th instant, at the .Oddfellows'., Halfc by our local Choral Sooiety. The programme will be a very fine one, and will consist,of operettas (2), part songB, solos, etc. Offenbach's beautiful little operetta "The Rose of Auverane," and Lecocq's muBical joke, " My UAcle the Ghost,' will both be, staged, aud wc can promise all those patronising the Society's concert a great treat. In addition; the song " Pipe all Hands!" written by our townsman, Mr Goodge, and set to music by Mr T. H. Mgssey (of Bathurst), will positively bo rendered with new and startling effects. Tho music of this song is now in the hands of tho Society's conductor (Mr Sherring), and the members aro hard at work on the chorus. This item alone will be well worth the modest chargc of admiwiou to the "pop," via,, is.
