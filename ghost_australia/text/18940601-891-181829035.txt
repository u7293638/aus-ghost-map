Amy Eobsart'fi Ghost. • ' A c urious action lias "been proceeding in the Chancery 'Division -recently over Otunnor Place: and Amy Robsnrt's ghost. It appears lliut the plaintiff,. Mr. Scott-Hall, agreed to buy Cmmior Place under the impression that it was "the one mentioned in ' Kenilwortlv " with "Douglas" Chamber and historic spook complete. ' Afterwards he ascertained that the Ctmiiior- referred to by the novelist stood some distance away. In1 point of fact (the «S(. Janus'Gazttie say.1*) Kir "Walter's "haunted • towers of Cumnorirall " never stood anywhere, Anthony Forstor'a Curouor was an "unpre tentious edifice, without any towers, in a close - hard by the church where he himself lies buried." In this house was the room known afterwards as the Dudley Chamber, and the fateful "paire of fitayres," at the bottom of which Lady Robert Dudley, nee Robsart, was found, with a broken neck {hat Sunday evening. But this Ctiranor Place has becu off the face of the earth for four-score years and more; and not even popular prejudice can compel n ghost to haunt a house that has ceased-to exist. That, as. affirmed by " the other side,". Lady Dndley Yghost took to a neighbouring pond is an assertion that needs confirmation by Mr. . Andrew Lang, without whoso knowledge he historic spook could possibly, commit sipcide.
