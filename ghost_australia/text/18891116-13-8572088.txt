PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. BY TELEMACHUS. CLOUDLAND AND SNOWLAND. "It's a divil of a place" said the car- driver. Not on the mountains of Victoria, but the uplands of Canada. He was driving the first grand master in this art of ours to the Niagara Falls in winter, and all the world was grey and cold, and "it's a divil of a place sir, a divil of a place," was the begin- ning and the end of the driver's comment. There was not much more to be said of the hospice on the morning which followed that evening of the soughing wind, for the clouds had come down to us, giving to our horizon a radius of about 10 yards. The wind had risen to something like a storm blast, and a tremendous procession of shapeless shapes, all grey, came hurrying up the gorge, and sweeping away over the ridge of the finger-post like witches to a sabboth. By ten o'clock the clouds broke in rain, but our horizon was not perceptibly extended. The wind smote the four corners of the house at times till it trembled ; hail and sleet rattled on the window panes. At noon low growls ot thunder were heard amongst distant hills, in the afternoon there was fierce hail, and at the night time still incessant storm and rain, and poor prospect of the morrow. But through the night new orders were issued by the powers of the air, the wind j passed away, and only the tail of the cloud wrack was left trailing about the gorgeB and the mountain beads. Mr. BoWBtad, very Jealous for the honour of his mountains, was at our doors with the earliest of the daylight and the message, " you'll make Baldy now." Obr intent was to " make Baldy," or, in other worclB, to ascend Mt. Hotham. With becoming alacrity therefore we tumbled out of bed, the more promptly perhaps as our eura were tingling with cold and the fire was crackling merrily in the chimney of the big room. , The first glimpse without, discovered anew world, The sombre gloom of the first even- ing, the chilly obscurity of the yesterday, were'broken up and banished. The sun was up, and his lances of light were driving through the lingering cloud Bkirts as the arrows of a victor through the rout of a vanquished aimy. The clouds were still rolling in foamy billows up the gorges ; they mantled at times on some great mountain breast like squadrons rallying forafinal stand. But as a light wind caught, and a strong sun shaft smote them again, they lifted and drifted from peak to peak, and meeting a new in- fluence above a mighty gorge became broken, as a sheet of molten lead is broken when flung from a shot tower, as the armies of the first Apostate were broken, when "Headlong, flaming, from the ethereal sky," they were Inunched on their tremendous fall. Strange shapes, wraiths, ghosts, phantoms are seen or imagined in the falling clouds, as divided by the beat, and rent and tattered by the wind, they fall through the crystalline air. Mount ITothiira is an un forested moun- tain with a great round crown. " Old Baldy," the diggers or the packers would call it, as they made around the snow or the snow-grass, and Btruck out towards Omeo or travelled down by Blowhard to "Mother Mole's" Bhanty. Baldy is six miles from the hospice, or, including the final rise, six miles and a "bittock" may be. We proposed to visit him and to return before breakfast We would walk away and the trap might follow. It was a morning for walking, the'ther- mometer registered 34deg., the atony track was "only washed with the rain, the sun- beams were glinting here and there, making wet points of grass sparkle, and broad leaves shine. The magpies were singing, and the kookaburraa laughing like mad a 1,000ft. below. Lyre birds were talking in divers tongues, the dingo was drawn from his lair by the genial warmth, and even the sleepy wombat put out his bottle nose from a burrow on the hill-Bide and snuffed np the sunshine. We walked two miles, and beard the rattle of the trap behind. It overtook UB on a saddle, and we climbed up and rode for about a hundred yards. Then came our first snow -the remnant of a drift alongside the wall of the cutting. It would have been possible to drive past it, but our horses had ideas of their own-they loved not the enow, they craned out their heads towards ii; they sidled away with their hind-quarters. Ihe truck was about 12ft. broad, the mountain side eloped 2,000ft. at about lOdeg. from the perpendicular. We agreed that the education of the horses in the matter of snowdrift, should be left to other hands, and set ,out once more afoot Soon did we come to a drift, through which no horses could have been driven. It lay right acroBS the road-a furlong below and a chain above-a great white blanket around whose upper edge we walked with difficulty, but across whose too tender breast we did not venture, for all the edges were melting, and a little stream waa running down the back, and weeping out below, and with very little inducement, probably the whole mass would start and slide. And then Î Well, then we would play a leading part in an avalanche, which, if we survived to relate it, might amuse many readers. But the prospect of survival was vague. This was the only considerable snow-flake lying right across the track, though others were near enough on the bills around, and all melting fast The air was full of the sound of running waters from the melting snow, every imaginable water voice was sounding around us ; the whisper of the little rivulet through the fern, the splash of the larger stream down a rocky face, the incessant roar of a gathered flood making a last plunge to the depths, and striking with might on the hard rock floor, the chatter and gurgle of the the mountain creek making down to the »iver. There were tracea also, evidences and rem- nants, of recent mimic avalanches ; Bcrub roots, with masseB ot earth and rock adhering, borne down and left on the track, and pas- sages down the steep below, where mightier masses had forced a way. Generally the mountain sides were rugged, almost pre- cipitous, and scantily clothed with dreary scrub or wretched limber. Far down in the gorges trees of a better growth might be seen, but nothing luxurious or rich. It is a sterile though a grand country. The only patch of gentle beauty is where the common but glossy-leaved yellow-blossomed scrub has fairly carpeted a hill face. There ia seen as dense, and fair, and even a surface, aa on the seaward side of one of the scrub-carpeted sand dunes at Sorrento. But what has been happening on Baldy through the night? Is it a light fall of snow fixed by the morning lrost? The whole of the crown seems to have been powdered with hoar-froBt and sown vitli Bpanglee. We marvel what it is as we journey on. The mountain head is lost for a moment at the elbow on the road by the Diamantina Springs. The head-waters of the Little Uiver, a strong tributary of the Murray, trickle down a crannied nook ' of the mountain here. Tbo Diamantina Springs they were named, after the lady of His Excellency Sir George Bowen, who many a year ago rode around here. There is a Diamantina River in Western Queens- land which derived ita name from the same source, and the extremes of variety in run- ning waters surely are reached by that dreary stream of the hot plaina and the snow-fed rapid of the mountains. Here also in later years a camp was established for Governor and Lady Loch, but local traditions tell that it was not quite n snccesB. Next to his raptures at entering the English lines in China long ago, Sir Henry will probably remember his joy at escaping out of these mountains. For the affair waB in the hunda of a coteryof self seekers and political dodgers, and was muddled accordingly. Pity that it should have been so muddled, because any one man of ordinary views and average out-door ex- perience could have rigged a camp and arranged a programme in the hills which would have lett happy memories in any life. We were happy enough, though six miles from the hospice, with the crown of the bill to climb, and no prospect of breakfast till our return. Leaving the track, and striking right np the face a little further along, we entered straightway amongst all the sparkle and ahme at which we had marvelled an tiour before. It wag simple as beautiful The rain had worn the mountain's snow blanket into holes , the blanket, indeed, was almost waahed away , but its raga and tatters had been fixed by the frost which followed the rain I hey were dotted over many acres of ground, white patcheB of snow, pale brown taits of grass, black patches of soil, grey faces of granite In the ntaht the wind had evidently been hushed before the rain ceased to fall-and the íroBt liad bit suddenly and keen livery pendant drop was frozen a crystal globule, every little trickle had made an icicle, and the low BUM'S ray Btriking across them now made all the ice to sparkle crystal or diamond like, lhere were many acres of this jewel field, sparkles, Itaalles, priBmatic rays crunching beneath our feet at every step And when we reached the cairn its weuther side was more heavily bejewelled Every Btone WUB coated with ice, and fringed with ICICIPS If St Simon btylttes had passed a night on that pillar 1 do not think he would have had much voice for thanksgiving m the morning. -here is nothing strange in intense cold here in the mid spring month. It ia the region of cold, 0,100ft aloft, Bogong, the highest of the Victorian hills, is but G,500tt, and 1'eathertop, which seems but a stone's throw away, is 0 300ft Tutu glittering jewellery of the frost is, however, but evanescent It will have melted by noon, and all the hard surface of the hill will be wretchedly, not gloriously cold There is a farther slope of the mountain, where the fuller harvest of the winter is garnered, where the drift has ulled every cleft, and inch on inch, foot on foot, made an apron of white which flushes back and seems untouched by the sunbeams Acres broad it lies there still, and the last of the summer's heat will be spent before its last Hake will have been melted down and carried by the rivulets to the little rivers, and the little rivers to the great river, which in turn will yield it to the thirsty low landa or bear it away to the liitsatiate sea It is a marvellously new sensation to the ordinary Australian to stand up here amongst the glittering ice on the edge oi the snow held«, to seo Feathertop cleaving the air beyond the Razorback ridge, and Bogong farther away, his valleys of snow like rivers of silver, to look down on a patch of the green Ovens valley, to look away over the high plains of Gippsland and the low lands of Central Victoria, to feel the rest of true Alpine rigours tingling along nerves and veins And yet it ia within 200 yards of a coach road, open now, and but a day and a half or a day and a night's journey of Melbourne In October or No vember you may mount amongst the snows and the clouds In that brief time As we turn, the continuous route of the cloud array makes still a glorious display In some deep valleys the sunshine hue been all triumphant, and lies lovingly now on the whole face of the foliage, which seems upturned in loving response But elsewhere, the massed vapours are still black, though melting away on white edges, like the snow- fields above. Above all these are great bays of blue, in which he many ewart sailed squadrons, nearly or absolutely at rest now, and all, like the waxen wings of Icarus, to meit away, and leave an unflecked Geld for the stars, when the last of the sun- light shall have risen above the western mountain face. < ' How much of the charm of variety, of the impress of grandeur which every mind can take, of the health "of Nature's mighty tonics, might all city and plain dwellers gain by a visit to these heights ' And what of the the artist, of the man and the woman who come to see, to understand, to interpret'' Truly to them there is a rich harvest, a full store, an earthly manBion prepared from the foundation of the world I Baw but one group of lulls, one arrangement of earth, air, and water m divers forms, arranged by Nature as with intent to accommodate the painter's | canvas It was a tew chains along the road from the Diamantina Springs. We turned there, and looked back awhile. As from many other points, Bogong closed a long perspective A mighty mass of deepest indigo, with broad snow crown, and long snow rivers on bia sides. To the lett Feathertop, half veiled in light clouds, the Razor-back leading from our feet to bia crest. Hotham on the right, his jewelled crown flashing above a skirt of tender green. There was no line of light from a swift glad river in the valley below, but an abundance of colour on all the turf, and of the tints and tones true artists love. Greena fading into brown, brightening into gold, or deepening through innumerable shades to the indigo of the great mountain barrier, and the Australian sky over all. With this picture in mind we turn our backs on the great mountains, and make towards the Hospice and breakfast We shall have negotiated a good twelve miles and a mountain, by the time we reach the Hospice, and may fairly consider that we have earned breakfast The old iron shanty is flooded with sunlight now, the fire IB roaring up the chimney, the bacon and eggs are hissing, and the kettle in Binging a merry tune Mr. Bowetead is without, glorying in his moun- tains, which he will never leave, though he may and will quit inn keeping I cannot think well of that Government official by whose advice or command this house and land were sold It is difficult to discover any justification or Battatactory reason for it A better place should have been put up in the beginning-a place worthy of the situation and adequate tor the accommodation of visitors, and if at any future time it was deemed necessary to Bell or lease, care should bare been taken to secure a competent man as purchaser or lessee. Old Bill Bowetead ia a pioneer, a warrior, a man who has laboured much and endured much, who has earned all the profit he will make out of his purchase, and a bit of a pension too, may be. But be IB n weather beaten old shellback, who sailed Australian seas when the coast waa very poorly lighted, and n mountain pilot, who kept his courses by stars and mountain beads when there waa not the sign of a track from station to station. He wants to retire now to end hiB days, resting in the moun- tains, and be has earned bia rest and abould be permanently endowed with it The tourist club of Bright desirea fo see a good bouse on the mountain, and so holds that a reason- able tariff might be insisted on. Surely Go vernment might help them a little in this way. Nature lins provided the picture gal- lery here, we have only to provide the house for the guests. 'Iwere well we did BO muen, asa colony I or people, for ourselves and our guests We bave a great heritage here, an everlasting source ot health and joy and rest, and of the inspiration of truest patriotism Tor if there be any truth in that the poet sings, it is not the land ot the spinning jenny and the steam hammer, the great warehouses, and the big financial institutions which killalea the ure of patriotic ardour. " Land of brown heath and shaggy wood , Land of the mountain aud the Hood, Land of m} sires I That is the high strain, and we may well Bing it here and take shame to ourselveB that we have neglected it BO long 'Hie colony is guilty of grosB neglect in this way, and the men who have gathered where they eowed not, and reaped where they have never tilled, who have dug gold from Australia's billa, and reaped the virgin harvest of her plains, and have departed with their wealth and left but havoc behind them, surely they all fall undar the " minatrel's malison ' 11 It such there breathe, go mark him well, tor bim nomlnstril raptures »well lllirh though his tltlo, proud his namo, Uoundless his wealth as wish can claim liesplto those tltlo«, power, and pelf, The wretch concentred all In self, Living shall forfeit fair renown And doubly dvlng shall go down To tho vile dust Irom whence ho sprung Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.' What ought they to have done in this matter, the rulers and the governors, mid the possessors of unearned wealth' We have but to look across the border to see what might be done. Travel the Blue Mountains there, with their wonder- ful treasure-bouse, the Jenolan Caves ; look at the great National Park and the Ceta tennial, newly created from the old sand and scrub wastes of Botany, and no matter how fervid the heat of your chauvinism, my young .Victorian, you shall not, if you be honeBt, escape a blush of Bhame. So move we on. I only meant to help my good friends of the touriste' club down below to stir up a little enthusiasm in the matter. We must begin to descend now. The horeeB are ready, the road is Bound, rain has no effect on these roads, and the quiet confidence mid watchful care of Jemmy our driver would carry the moat timid passenger safely past the sidlings. And really the road which leads right up to the Hosoice, and to the cairn on Mount Hotham and on to Omeo is not bad at all. It needB looking after ; the parsimony in small matters which characterises so much of our life, is letting it go to rack a bit But I rom tlie 16th of this month Messrs. Craw- ford and Connelly, the enterprising coach proprietors of Beechworth, have been run- ning a four horse coach right through to Omeo, by which tourists may travel, breaking their journey at will. We bowl along the table land in our two horse coach, rounding the elbows with an easy grace which begets confidence and appréciation. We meet a party of mounted miners driving u packer before them, and one or two .of the old sort toiling along with their swngs. The packer is usually an awk- ward fellow on a narrow truck. He likes the inside running, and though he may not light, will stand for it, and squeeze away with his pack as stubborn as a goat or a bear. It was very awkward in the old days when strings of a couple ot score came along, but thoBe days ore cone by. We drive with- out apprehension of any serious obstacles, and at the beginning of the four thousand feet drop, cut u heavily-leaved sapling to drag back from the axle, and still swing along. There are many pleasant glimpses on the road, though the forest scenery is not re- markable, and the time of the wild flowers is not yet fully cqrae. The snow elad peuks seem to nod and smile farewell to us. The valleys 'below open peaceful, verdant, homelike. The grimy charcoal burners, who seem to bear perpetually the devil's brand, are busy ubout their fires. Evidences of the mining revival are noted in trama and drivea, smoking shafts, and races taking the water along to a newly-erected crushing plant ; in the presence also of the new order of miners, the experts, metallurgists, school of mines men,- who never draw a bow at a venture, or put in a drill with serious intent till they have collected all available evidence, and au omitted it to every possible test We do not tarry long in Harrietville, nor waste time along the valley which leads us down to Bright. Nor even in that fair vil- lage are we permitted more than a quarter of an hour's spell, for a change of horses is ready, and we are to do the Eurobin Falls. These are twelve miles trom the village, and the miles, though all beautiful, are not all good. The village street strikes one again as singularly pleasant, its old trees are so well grown, and so varied in kind. The elms predominate in number, as the poplars in height, but over many a garden fence droop boughs of walnut and cherry trees, while apples, pears, and plums make almost a forest growth within. Down by the river and on the roadside pad- dock fences the blackberry has grown in vagrant luxuriance, mounting ten feet high, spreading twenty feet wide, forming an im- penetrable barrier against all kinds of stock, but occupying a good deal of ground, and making a terrible harbour for vermin. No- body seems to care for the berries. The seeds and husks of last year's crop hang by tens of thousands on the stalks. They are no more prized than the wild rose blooms, which in places nod above or trail over the brambles in glorious confusion of form and harmony of colour. And yet I have heard of Americans making £60 per acre per annum out of black- berries, and doubt not that many a hundred- weight would sell at a good price in Mel- bourne if they were but carefully gathered and scientifically packed. How much per annum do our city florists make out of black- berry leaves associated with a little artistic instinct and thoughtful arrangement? The rabbits have made a home in these blackberry bushes and in the fern- covered log fences so frequent by the roadside. I fear the rabbits will become a thorn in the side of the farmers by-and-by. A natural fear of this sort arises when in one paddock a hundred are seen skipping about in the gloaming, and memories of other localities recur where the little rabbit is regarded as the chief of all nature's curses. But the farmers do not seem to have made a fair and orderly beginning here yet. There are more weeds than crops in their paddocks, and a general air of slovenliness about, which offends instincts of practical utility even more than an appreciative sense of beauty. And, moreover, we are not out on a farming expedi- tion, and five miles from our start are happily clear of the farms. By a bush track we enter a bush country then ; a country, pleasant in its details, rather than grand in its general outlines, for we catch but occasional glimpses of toe great rampart of the Buffalo. Big common-place gums and peppermints are all about, grass is abundant, and scattered through the grass are flowers. The little wild violets, scentless, but very fair, are frequent as daisies on an English village-green, and many white orchida riBe high as the tallest blue belle, and thick enough for the children to gather in handfuls. Wattle-bloom is plenti- ful also, and on the banka of the Eurobin Creek, which we presently strike, a wild lilac, its sparse foliage almost burled in the heavy purple blossom. A charming valley for a children's outing, even before the falta are reached, but that the road is excessively bad. A year ago there was no road at all, and only the strenuous and sell-sacrificing efforts of the tourists' club, have made the track along which we now proceed with difiiculty. The members of this pluckly little society have done more than put their hands into their pockets here. They organise frequent Working bees, and backed by their lady friends they set up a solid front ngainBt the energy-waBting game of football. They come out in strong parties with picks and Bhovels and crowbars and axes. They fell trees, shift boulders, bridge creeks, make causeways over bogs, and so gradually render their beautiful Eurobin Falls more approachable. They imagine they have a reasonable claim on the Government, as trustees of the public funds, for a little financial assistance here, and 1 am sure every rational man when made properly acquainted with nil the circumstances of the case will heartily support them in this appen!. Indeed there ts little doubt that ¿10,000 a year judiciously Bpent in making and meuding tourist»' roads to picturesque locali- ties in Victoria would be an excellent and sound investment. And it such n vote were ever carried, this track would certainly gets its shate, for it leads to a scene of beauty which no tourist should miss. The Fulls are sup- plied by the water which is garnered by the winter snows, and poured out all summer long I from the deep sunk morasses on the mountain head. They are double through the whole coutse of their descent, the minn fall tumbling down a great gorge, which we Bball see later on, and descending with a wild plunge into a basin, which bears the somewhat commonplace name ot "The Lady's Bath." Surely, there ia some belle of the valley whose name might be attached to this beauty spot ; mid if the chivalry ot the district be not sufficiently audacious lor BUCII a liberty, history, modern or ancient, might suggest something. What of the name of her who called aloud in her desolation " O, Mother Ida, hearkon ern 1 dlo ; Par off tho torront called mo from the cleft ; Fur up the solitary morning »moto Tim streaks of virgin snow." Poor Onone, her name might well have immortality here, where cataract alter cataract tails, shouting towards tho sea, and the tremendous rock front, even as "top- most Gargurus," "stands up and takes the dawn." The greater fall leaps through a bower of green, and falls headlong down a face of rock to the bath. The lesser, curves out above a tremendous rounded face of granite, and linds with many a leap, a channel by its side, until it finally descends to the valley and weds with its sister in the creek, The foliage around is not remarkable. The granite soil does not encourage luxuriant growths. A few gnarled gums and broad leaved wattles, numerous delicate mountain ferns, and some of a more robust type fairly in the under channel ; great grey rocks piled conlusedly, the mountain Ince and the gorge above, and a tract of wild Australian bush-land immediately around. A charming picnic spot, full of pleasant shade and sound send rest!ulness ; an excellent climbing-ground for adventurous spirits, a line lield tor the student of ' botany or geology } a beautiful spot in many ways. But Its impression is become dim with me now, Ifor since I have been right up to andover the Buffalo head, and hump, and horn, and have seen things there, which leave all impressions struck below somewhat blurred and din.
