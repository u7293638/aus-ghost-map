ST. DAVID'S BURIAL GROUND. | SIR-The proposal of " The Ghost " to use St. David's Cemetery for the purpose of the proposed Exhibition is too ridiculous to be worthy of notice if opportunity had not been taken to unfairly attack " all concerned in it," whoever that may mean. It is not true that the cemetery is a disgrace to " all concerned in it," on the contrary it will bear very favourable comparison with any of the closed cemeteries in this city' and is kept in as good order as the moderate funds in the hands of St. David's Cathedral Board will allow. Grazing a few sheep therein cannot be considered desecration, and on the other hand the appearance of the ground is improved by the grass being kept down thereby. Besides, in England it is almost universally adopted, and is there thought unobjectionable. " The Ghost " evidently has not learned the meaning of charity as St. Paul teaches, although he may now live in another, and let us hope a better, world, and be only an occasional visitor to this. -Yours, etc., CHURCHWARDEN.
