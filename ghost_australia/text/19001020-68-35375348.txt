ANOTHER GHOST VANISHES. For some time Malew, in the Isle of Man, has boasted of a ghost haunting its parish church. The spectre was said to walk nightly up the aisle, candle in hand. Even the vicar of the parish, the Rev. Mr. Spicer. had to confess that he saw a mysterious light, moving from the doorway end of the church to the chancel, and then vanishing. But in place of attributing it to ghosts he snreihed for a more prosaic explanation, and found it. The light comes from the distant revolving beams of the Lang ness Lighthouse. The light cannot le seen from the road, hbut the church stands on a slightly higher level, and its windows just catch the rays as they swing slowly round.-"Daily Mail."
