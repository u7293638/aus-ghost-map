A PASTORAL LETTER. I INFALLIBLE AUTHORITY OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. Cardinal Moran has issued to the clergy and faithful of the Diocese of Sydney a pastoral letter on the " Infallible Authority of the Roman Catholic Church " in the course of the letter the Cardinal says - I purpose to set before you on the present occasion a few reflections on the priceless gift of infallible authority to teach divine truth which was given by the Rcdoonicr to Holy Church It is not in any spirit of control t roy that those remarks are made but the consideration of this great truth should stimulate all the faithful children of the Church to raise the Most High for the races able money He has shown them not to offer to Him the heartfelt tribute of their gratitude an 1 love in return for his wondrous love It should also serve to quicken the men out- of t her re ii m pr lying that (oil would confer on so many as yet separated from the one t true fold the blessings which it is our jim dogs to enjoy There are countless souls liowrtlayB who though otttivarilli separately from the communion of the Catholic Church are nevertheless also with us in spirit, for it is not through any malice of the heart but through sheer ignorance that they have stray ed away from the foot of the one true Shepherd It is not by angry disputation that we can hope to see those straying ones, so loved by the Redeemer, brought back to His fold but it is through fervent prayer to God that the heavenly light and money, and the strengthening gates of which they stand in need, shall be granted to them 1 len s mu of the human institutions which we count it is in the world chum for themselves an unerring authority The legislature, the Crown the judicial bench, in so many cases will not allow their decisions to be ques tinned, and they assert a curtain me sure of suitable bility We must benefits, however not to con- fined such a pretentious claim with that of Holy Church Her infallibility cm admit of no admixture of corruption or deceit in Inst on the other hand, no matter how sublime may be the authority with which more human institutions are my rested their pronouncements and decrees cannot be always free from the faint of or for the reason of this difference is that the infallibility of such human institutions is decreed and guaranteed only by man who in his various pursuits is encompassed with infirmity, and is liable to err, but the infallibility of the Church is decreed and guaranteed by God, who is truth itself, and can neither receive nor lie deceived the Cardinal, having quoted several passages from Scripture to support the claim that the Roman dtlioho Church is infallible proceeds -What fil- ions from all this i It assuredly follows that the Church is the divinely appointed witness to man of the teaching of our blessed 11 old But her testimony is not that of a mere witness It bears impressed upon it the soil of flower Perhaps I should rather say that her authoritative voice should he considered as the voice of God Himself, who fetches divine truth through Holy Church, and chooses her as His appointed organ for revealing His will to man It will he liked how far dies this infallible teaching of the Church extend ' Its wide domain embraces all the lessons of heavenly wisdom revealed by our blessed Lord The researches of science, the teachings of human wisdom, political programme, the developments of commerce the building up of worldly wealth and prosperity, form no part of the direct mission given to the Church or of the divine heritage consigned to her care The deposit which she received from God! and which she shall never cease to guard with inviolable fidelity, otuhncesnll the truths of divine faith, and all the lessons of morality commended to the apostles by our honour " The Pnnclcio will teach you all truth " " teach all nations to observe all things whatever I have commanded you ' Ilma the truths travelled by the Roilonmcr, the precepts of the moral law which He enforced, the maxims of perfection which He imparted to His bangles, all this forms part of the heritage of the Church, and comes within the domain of her infallible teaching For whom has the Church received her mission and how long is it to oratorios 1 teach all nations " is the Redeemer s command preach My the time to every ci tatura " The Du mo commission embraces all nations and all tongues and extends to every race and every people And it shall last till the end of time I met with you all days, even to the consummation of the world I " " The Spirit of Truth will shale with von fir over to " the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" Fresco will be the enemies who assail the Church, incessant the warfare waged against her, yet she shall not be overcome Heresies from ago to ago will arise, and will end- don our by every art to corrupt the doctrine of Holy Church in that doctrine, however no corruption can find a place " the gates of bell shall not prevail " and all the devices of horoay will only serve to bring into bolder relief the brightness and purity of divine truth preserved and guarded by the Catholic Church The Church throughout the nineteen counties if her history has ever shown herself conscious of the ineffable gift of an infallible authority in her tench lug conferred on her by the Re lecturer When the Apostles assembled for the first time in bynoe! at Jerusalem they proclaimed their doctrinal teaching to be the touch of the Holy Glint, find they heralded its announcement with the emphatic words " It has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us ' their successors in every n Cohave exclure I the same sublime piece 'ative v.Ylieiiover Christian morality was expended, and when heresy sought to corrupt the teachings of divine truth the Church by her infallible authority condom led the more and cast forth their adherents from her fold It nist toned not how plausible thorn errors may, it be or how they were sustained by the power of princes or the applause of men the Church hurled her medical against them, and arrived here ill ever ready to endure nil form of persecution and Eritrea ing Sooner than til it her moral teaching or her sacred deposit of divine truth should not tinted by the admixture of error Arms in his heresy was supported by all the prestige of the Imperial Court, yet he was condemned and cast forth from the Church. A ci battery later other heretics would put up their voice against the exalted dignity of the Mollieroi God the bishops of the Church assembled in Ephesus pronounced apathy in against them, and sat the rest of unerring authority on the glorious privilege of the Blessed Virgin A little 1 iter other heretics assure I the doctrine of divine faith 'the great Pope, St Leo, condemned their errors, and, the fathers of the Council of Chalcedon registering his authoritative teaching, proclaimed the solemn truth, " The Apostle St Peter has spoken to us through Pipo Too " When the Greek schism arose, and men in their pride of place would ask that one short formula would be omitted from the creed, the Church chose rather to see the whole empire of the Past torn from her communion than that one tittle of the filth worth 1 To imperilled In the sixteenth century, in England a powerful monarch would ask for nothing more than to set aside his marriage in legation and to the rain so far once on the moral law the reply you pertaining with no uncertain sound was given by the Holy See to his demands, and as a result, although the pride and passion of a corrupt sovereign, the kingdom of England was separated from the fold of Christ In later times, Tansomam and Galhcanisni would endeavour to sow dissensions among the faithful, maid and r the mark of piety would betray the cause of truth Bufonee more, in the face of the powers of this world league 1 against her, the Church proclaimed the great It with that when the 10 IIB' question of the report of divine faith there could be no compromise baUveelt light and darkness between piety and imports and Tnn schism i nth I illicinlsiii wore for over cast forth from her communion thus, thanks to the unerring prerogative of the Church and its unflinching exercise in every age the residents; streams of sacred truth for the ineffable comfort and console lion of faithful souls are found to flow as pure to ii ty from the fountain of orthodox) as they were in the Apostolic ago Here it may be remarked that it is the Catholic Church alone that of time to be on lowed with an infallible authority whilst guiding the faithful in their heavenward course the various sects, no matter how boldly they may assert their tenets put forward no pretence of chum to infallibility Now of these teachers in the various sects are not me Bible, they may be nothing better then blind killers of the blind 1 neir follow cars cannot accept their teaching as thodoctiincsof divine faith, and instead of (Hiding lo Paradiso they may be conducting their unhappy dupes to otirnslruin But it will be met that the Bible is infallible in its teaching, and hence when the various Scots holdfast to it they are sure to possess the teachings of dry mo faith the Catholic Church accepts the Bible with all my erence V of rev ere it M the inspired Word of God the bulw arc of north down, the depository of divine truth The Sacred Scripture is given to the Church its a few only armoury of defence and as the Apostle writes," it is lirulltahlo to (each to reprove to correct to instruct unto justice, that the man of God may be perfect furnished to every good work" (i Timothy, m lo) But, on the other hand there are many things in the sacred text which even the most studious and most enlightened find it diffi cult to understand The Prince of the Apostles St Peter in his second epistle warned the faithful of such difficult passages, even in those early days, in the writings of St Paul, ' Wherein (he says) are some things hard to be understood, which the un- learned and steadfast west, as they do also the other Scriptures, unto their own destruction" (2 Pet ill. 10) The Church is the divinely authorise 1 interpreter r of the inspired text, and she is at the same time its 7 alous custodian, handing it on in corrupt from ORO to ago for the consolation and instruction of the entitled The Nestorians set themselves to explain various scripture texts after their own fashion with the sad result that a great part of the East, deluded by their plausible words, has been kept in heresy even to the present day I need scarcely add that, in the sixteenth century, Protestantism, in its revolt again the authority of the Church pursued the same course It would have the Bible and nt thing but the Bible for its (side and thus every error of its vain imagining was justified by reference to Scriptural texts By a singular inconsistency, Protestants would accept as unerring the to telling of the Catholic Church whilst she handful down to them the Bible as God's inspired Word, but they altogether repudiate 1 her authority when she would assert her mission to be the authentic teacher of divine truth As the result of such an erroneous principle, we see that so many persons looking to the Bible as the only source of religious instruction are led away into the most fanciful errors even in regard to the fundamental doctrines of divine faith Agitated by perplexing doubts, they are tossed about without rudders com- mud on the ocean of uncertainty, and even on the verse of the grace they have no consoling doctrine to cheer them no solid found time for then hope It wnspreciscly to guard His children against such painful anxieties and uncertainties that the Kcrleomir invested His church with not infallible authority Looking back on the history of the past 100 years, we see that the Catholic Church alone, guided by Him who is " the way, the truth, and the life," hits steadily pursued her onward course, authoritatively interpreting the sacred Scripture and unfolding to her children the teachings of durne truth. On the other hand, many Protestant countries have lapsed into infidelity and flung aside all reverence for the sacred text, some retain little more than the empty name of Protestantism, whilst most of those who remain bona-fide Protestants do so in ignorance of the origin of their creed In everything that is merely human the Church is subject to change Her discipline varies in different countries just as the national usages of various peoples may vary Her manner of illustrating the doctrine of truth is not the same at the close of the nineteenth century as it was even a century ago the enemies who combat against her to-day are not the same who assailed her in former times their line of attack, their arms, their armour, are all changed She, too, changes her armour that she may combat and overcome them on their o\ u ground and with their own weapons But her treasures divine morality and truth is ever the same, and no power of earth or hell can corrupt that sacred inheritance bequeathed to her by our Blessed Lord Jams it is that the Catholic Church, over ancient yet over now pursues the path divinely marked out for her through the course of ages
