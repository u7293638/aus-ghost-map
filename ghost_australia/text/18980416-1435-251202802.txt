WITTENOOM'S FAREWELL Not au revoir, this is "good-bye," I'm off across the sea, My native land. Farewell! Adieu, dear W.A., to thee; No more I'll climb the hills of Perth, no more I'll see the Swan, And ere these lins are put in type I will indeed be gone, The evil that men do in life lives after them 'tis said, I leave you with my imperfections heaped upon my head; Incompetent pronounced, I go to fill a higher post, And so perforce have given up the Legislative ghost. Yet oft methinks my thoughts will turn to when in happier days, My name was great, and men found voice, to sound aloud my praise; But you may bet the market price, my thoughts alone will torn, To where the practice was, of late, my effigy to burn; The case which holds my thinking power will ne'er return where stalks The man who of a Minister would make a Guido Fawkes. The blue wave rolls beneath our keel, the shore receds from view; My heart throbs—perhaps it's not my heart —adieu, Wahoo! Ya-hoo! !
