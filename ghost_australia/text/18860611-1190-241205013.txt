HOW rOMfKU WAS OVBRWHKLMED, The terrible voloznio truption in the hot l«k0 district of New Ze#l»nd n»tar#Uy ozlla to nicd the dtecription hy Pliny of th# horror# which #ccompiDi#d the de#traction of tho Ronia oity of Pompoti, in th# ynnr, AaD., 79. This terrible erent wu tho moot afm of tbo kind of whioh then io i&y; roeotd in bittory. The country rarronodioff tie To'cnno of Votoviai wm «o oompUteiy covered by tehee, Uto, and other dopoeiU, ithet all lend merki wore swept nway. For noerly seventeen ce&turiee; tho ezect eito of Pontwii wm e mjitery, bnt ia 1760, the first dicooveriae of tho troot" of the ruined city wore dlsooverei. Since then whole street# end iqueroa and hnndtoda of houses hnro boon dinentombed, end gheatty troces of tho ftnddonntes of tho horror were found in tb« ibape of human skeletons in all monners of poaitiono. Of course tho ornpHon in New Zealand is ot present In no wey comporeblo In magnitude or difMtrous roeolta to thnt whioh led to tho destruction of Pompeii, but it ie on n sufficiently Urge scalo to oaum roferenoe to tho greater event particularly interesting especially to j ooo g people Loid Ljtton in hie powerful work "the Laat Days of PompiU" of which cheep edition# may be obtained for a mora trifle, gives a traaelation of aalient portions of Pliny's descrlptioo, of the awful event, and from it wo reprint the following extract# The oloud, whioh had ecatterod eo deep a mmkinets over tho day, had now settled into a Eolid and impenetrable aa«# It resembled lee# even tbo thickest gloom of a nigbt In tb# open air than the close and blind darknis# of tome narrow room. Bnt in proportion a# tba blacknua# fathered, did the lightning# around Vesuvius acieaae in their vivid and eoorcblng glare. Nor was their horrible bt anty oo 1 fined to the usual hue# of fire; bo raiobsw ev«r rivalled their vary ing and prodigal dye#. Now hiightly blue a# the most azure depyi of a lontherasky— -now of a livid and tnaksiik# green, dattiag lestleetly to and fro m the folde of an eaormoua serpent— now of a lurid and intolarable crimsoo, guiUing forth through the colamna of smoke, (ar and wide, and lightirg up tho wbolo city (rom arch to arch,— then euddenly dying into a sickly palenonn, like the ghost of tneir own life ! In the pan#et or th# shower# you beard the rumbliog of the earth beneath, and the groaning waveeoftbe tortured sea: or lower aiill, and andihl# but to the watch of lnteniest fear, ih# grinding and hiaeing murmur of tho eaaaping gasee through thecnaam# of the distant moun tbio Somoiime# the clond appeared to brtak from its solid mass, and, bv the lightning, to a# turns quaint mcd vast mimicries of hnmau or of mcsftter shapes, ctridiog across the gloom, hurtHng ooo npon tho otbor, and vaalsbiog saiftiy into tba turbulent abvsa of ahsde, so that, to the eye# and fancies of the affrighted wanderers, the unsnbetantlal vapor# wore a# tbo boddy forma of gigantic foe# — th# agents of tairof and of death. i ds at net in many places were aireaay kcei deep ; snd the boiling shower# which cm«froai the steaming breath of the volcano forced their way Into the howe#, bearing with them a strong and fioff coating vipour, Imomeplivcts, immense i ragmtnU of roclt.hdrled open thg house roofs, bore down along the streets masissof oonfunn ruin, which yat more and more, with every hour, obstructed tbo way ; mid, a# the day advanced, the motion of tho earth was moie sensibly felt— the footing teemed to slide and creepLnor conld chariot or litter be kept steady even on tb# mobt level grounA Sometimnn tho boger stones striking againtt stcb other aa they fell, broke into counil#a fragment#, emitting sparks of fir#, which caught wbatevtr wu combustible wi hin their reacb, and along the plains bejocd tho city tho darkLeea was now terribly relieved; for several homes, and oven vineyard#, had bean set on flame# ; and at vari ooe interval the fires roee suddenly and fiercely galDBt the solid gloom. To add to thie partial relief of the daikneea, the citizen had, hers and there, in tbo more publio place, such aa the porticoes of templM ana the en trances to tbo fotnm, endeavored to place rows of torcbos ; but thsso rarely continued long; the showers and the winds extinguished them, and the sudden darkness irto which their sodden birth was converted had something In it doubly terrible and doubly impressing on the impote&oe; of human hopes, the leiron of despair. Frequently, by the momentary light ot these torcbsv, parties of fugitives encountered eaoh otbvr, eome harrying towards the sea, other fly- u g from tbo sea back to the land; for the ocean bed rttrealtd rapidly from the shore— an utter daikuei# lay over it,etd,upou its groaning and tossing wave# the storm of cinders and rock fell without the protection which the streeet# and roofs afforded to tho land. Wild, haggard, ghastly, with supernatural fears, these groups encountered each other, bnt without the leisure to apeak, to consult, to adviae ; for the shdwer fell cow frequently, though not continuously, extinguishing tho lights, whicu bowed to oarh band 'be douV tike faces of the other, and hurrying all to te;k tefnge beneath tho nearest shelter. The whole jlniitflfit nf frivllliffiftl ftti BM hrnVin tin Ever and anon, by the fllickering light#, yon saw tho thief hastening oy the moet solemn authorities of thi law, laden with, and fearfully chuckling over, the produce of his snddsn gains. If, in the dark- n«nn, wife was separated from husband, or patent from child, vain was tho hops of ro- onion, Each hurried blindly and confusedly on. Nothing iu all the various and complicated machinery of aociallife was left save tbo primal law of Mlf pisservatlon! Advancing, as men grope for escape in a dua- gecn. lone and ber lover continued their uncertain way. At the moments when the volcanic lightnings lingered over the streets they were enabled, by Uut affoJ light, to steer ard guide their progreee: yit, little did the view it preeentea to thtm cheer or encourage their path. Iu part#, where the aehea lay dry and uncommlzed with the boiling torrents, cast npward from tbt mountain at capricious intervale, the surface of the eatth presented a leprous and ghsst'y hits. In other places, cindsr and rock lay matted in bean#, from beneath which emerged the half-hid limne of tone cruafaed and mingled fugutive. The groan# of the eying were broken i>y wi.J shiieke of women's terror — now near, now dis tant— which, when heard in the utter darkne-", wete rendered doubly appalling by tho crn hii t; : eente cf belplesenenn and the uncertainty of tic perl# around ; and clear and 'lintim" m through all were the mighty and van ou# rtotscs from the Patil MouaMu. it# rubhing wiads ; its whitliag ior;e. .t-; and, from time to time, the bu.it at:d roar of tome more tiary and tierce f-\po-<iun.
