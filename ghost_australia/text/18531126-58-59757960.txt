GATHERINGS FROM MANY SOURCES. THE BULLY.—If you will have the goodness to scan those dozen men sitting together, you will almost immediately detect one of them as belonging to the class of bullies. There is some- thing in his look that at once tells you his char- acter .There is a hardness in his eye, an ex- pression of bull-d g determination about his countenance, both clearly indicating a customer who will have his own, way if he can, and who will prefer to gain it by forcible methods rather than any other. You hear his voice above every one else's ; and he speaks with a resolute and determined air, as though he, having given his opinion, there were an end of the matter, and no one besides must say a word. Should some- body be bold, enough to reply in opposition, our friend glares upon him, and stares at him as though the speaker were giving unmistakeable evidence of insanity, and then fires at him a re- joinder ,of blunt contradiction, garnished with something like abuse. In fact, all he does and says, a man of his class seems to intimate that what he wishes shall be carried out, let who may oppose him ; and, if resistance be offered, let the opponent look to himself. There is " I will have it;" on his tongue, in his eye, in his knitted brow, on his firmly compressed lips, in the manner in which he sits in his chair, in the fashion in which he walks ; he is a " bully ;" he was no n tion of gaining any thing pleasantly ; what he gets he will get by conquest ; he likes fighting for fight- ing sake ; what he wants he'll take ; he would prefer snatching it from you to your putting it into his hand ; he disdains kindnesses, but gloats over submission. In fact, he is a coarse, rude, selfish, disagreeable brute. I am afraid l am myself falling into something of vulgarity in de- scribing this kind of individual, but really our coarser specimen of bully is so very disgusting an animal, he is such a nuisance, does so much mischief (for, the misfortune is, he does generally get his way, undeserving though he be), that it is a great treat to be able to say a few true words of him, without the chance of being blackguarded in return. Every one triumphs at the downfall of a bully ; and there are occasions when he comes down with a run ; when, his ordinary acuteness and discrimination having failed him, he has found himself involved in an unpleasant skirmish with calm, determined individual (not a bully) who knows the right and sticks to it, and will not be put down ; who, like David advancing upon the vaunting man of Gath, with the simplest weapons, and without the slightest parade, straightway settles him in the quietest and most gentlemanly style. Grace Greenwood, who is now in Italy, on asking a poor woman who had placed one can- dle at the image of a saint, and another at the image of the devil, why she placed one at each, was told by the poor devotee, that " she knew not into whose hands she might fall, so she thought she had better be civil to both." IMPORTANT TO MANUFACTURERS.—The ma- chinery of a cotton-mill in general goes like clock work, but this is not the case when the hands strike. THE AMERICAN CUPID.—A young lady calls Mr Hobbs, Cupid, because Cupid is Love and Love, as the proverb says, laughs at locksmiths, and so does Mr Hobbs. .. Voltaire and Pirott hid been to -.pass-MUX timo at a country seat. One day Piron wrote or Voltaine's^.dr^roent; . ".Çoms."
