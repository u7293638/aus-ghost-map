SYDNEY CUP WEIGHTS. f have just send Yat a woman's opinion of the Sydney Cup weights, in the Sydney Town and Country Journal, and I think, if over any" thing wits damned by faint praise, these have been, for he winds up by saying that the li indic ip is one of the best that Mr. Scarr has left unmtifictutcil Couinienciug with Goldsbrough, Oat 5lbs, there is not attach to cavil at, and I see JL Batnaid his given him 9st 6lbs in the Austiah m cup , but this is two miles and a quarter, and I should have given Dal 7lbs in the Sydney Cup, so that there is not much between the Kingsborough could have done with 2lbs less, us I don't quite believe the Metropolitan mine Jivcliiis weight is the first mistake in the handicap, and he should have got 8st 7lbs to give him a chance , but it looks as it he never will get a chance of winning a two mile handicap Calumny could also A have FIGHT with 8st 7lbs, and should not be thrown in Melbourne, with 9st 3lbs would have been no but the mark, seeing that he was beaten the other day in the Geelong Cup in a smart field of her son, will Sst Ollis, had only got third place benton by ten lengths Four am.; it llielunoiiil's weight, I am inclined to think Jil Scut belongs to the lltiiniuie^ociet), and is The fancies Richmond is getting too stitch work, it gives him the thumping weight of 8st, so that he warn I am for the Sydney Cup I wonder what Jil Icllott says about it, but I think he will ever) Shortly let him know by drawing his pen through his n uno In 1874 1 it >. attendant got 7st 6lbs and did not accept In 1879 iv.iiigBboiou.gh got 7st 12lbs, and did not escape, and in 1870 Richmond gets 8st Mr Scan seems to go on the Excelsior principle, so that good men cut be got to I ide the cells , but I can afraid the on au H wont appreciate it Although Rich- fund his been running first and second for all the mess he has am this season, it is no reason why he should not be allow e I a chance of winning the by what y Cup, as well as any outsider in the n< li I ml in i i And this season although in small fields he has been very near winning them , but in the Melbourne Cup, which is a similar case to the Sydney Cup, he only got MC and place will 10st 3lbs and received a five pound Taking from Wol- human 7st, 8lbs As it is not collect the handicap a horse on uno peas for mance, I shall take his Geelong Cup I mining into consult a union with 7st tilba Handicapping Iticlmioiul on his Melbourne Cup i inning, and allowing for his boating and improvement in to, his weight in the Sydney Cup should be Ost alibi, ) lit if I bundle rip him on his Geelong i mining hisiveiglif should be 7st 10lb As neither of these men do, I shall strike the balance between (the lines laid 7st 6lbs, (and it will ghost 5lbs , but is I don t deal in half pounds like " The Aduti in I should say) 7st fibs, or 7st 5lbs, and at 7st 5lbs he would be put feet cheek on outsiders thrown in, and not allow them to an inn canter like Don Juan, Hancut, Imperial, and Wol- him as to make it plain for any novice, Goldsbrough gave ltieliminil 8lbs in Melbourne Cup, and only learned i nibs Taking, now they are handicapped in a difference is on)) 12lbs And I am certain if Mr Se til wife asked for the reason why he has by night them so she or, he could not give a Htitit-fnctoiy no Javelin, Cnliiinii), Melbourne, Richmond, and twelve Hu co ) cm allow me ill bully li handicapped, and it is a rather n in n j j lupin lion in a small handicap of a city on horses, which should be a mere breathing for nimmo up to the work Mr li un and has given Goldsbrough 9st 6lbs in Australian Cup) Mr Scarr has given him 1st. bars in Sydney) Cup, and I would give him 9st. 7lb. s , so that we are all pretty near each other in out cHtun site of the gre a son of I iceworks Mr. Barnard and I also agree is not Melbourne, but 111 state my opinion against the two limit cippciK di nee Smith Uni tiny boat formed a viz mg chemist of Richmond s capabilities Mr 1! i nail, in the Australian Cup, li is no relying indic topic I Richmond against Lum! team, which every one must know is wrong, because, in handle hoping, you must handicap a horse against any horse in the face, and herein lies the tli/hctilfy Richmond has been a lucky colt for Mr Jellett, but I am aft and after his Humane campaign we final! to him very stale in the autumn I remember what a miserable plight Incwoiks was in when he returned from Launceston and Victoria, with all his Dot bees, and Leger, and Champion Race honors thick upon him When he took his preliminary canter he moved like a cat on hot backs, but when he warmed up, he was all there to make Stumpy ay part in a mile and a tractor Goldsbrough, although one of our greatest horses, has not been in great winner In his two year old season he was unsuccessful As a three year old he won a Minion Plate at Bendigo, St Leger and Autumn Stakes at Randwick At four years old, he commenced well by winning the Hawkesbury Handicap, and i nursing a good second for the Metropolitan Asa five year old, he won the Metropolitan In the fastest time done in the colonies, and has since um a grand second to Richmond, in the Champion Stakes, the weights being all in favor of the three-year olds Goldsbrougll will soon leave the turf for the more important duties of the stud, and I have no doubt he was til turn out a most successful sire, because he comes of a winning family on both sides Honest old Dagworth has gone to the happy hunting grounds (where I hope he won't require sound legs) Mr Turner his always been a princely Supporter of the turf, but the running of Dagworth in the Champion Race will always be a blot on his name If it was not Mr Fisher's first offence, I should say he ought to get twelve months on the treadmill, but as he is a heavy loser by the death of Dagworth, I think he ought to be let off this time the evergreen Strop has just won the Hobart Town Cup, with 9st 3lbs , time, 3 min 45sec Strop is H years of age, and won the Launceston Champion Race in 1800 in 1869 he also worst, beating the great Glencoe But we must not forget our old friend Ena, who won the Glen Innes Cup, carrying 7st flies, two miles, time, 3min 44sec He also won the Grand Stand Plate and the Stewards Purse at the same meeting Old Erin appears to be going in for a jollification, as he Ira just won the New England Cup I hope it is a big one, 66 that he can have a big drink out of it.
