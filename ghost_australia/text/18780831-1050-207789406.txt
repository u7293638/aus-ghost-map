THE ACCOUNT. OF PAPAL INFALLI- ' BILITY. " " -'' <'u:. -u. .. .- Some . time ago, Dr. Manning gave a- "'True, rriccount of-the VaticanCouncil " in-tho 'Nine- '""teenth Century jRevieiv.' ' Professor ' Freidrich1 of .Munich, an Alt , Catholic,' ! shows its thorough inaccuracy in the Contemporary Revieio for Juno of ( 'this year. In respect tothe necessity of proclaim! ing the. Pope infallible, :Dr. i Manning, wrote in: the following style. " The true and ultimate : reason which determined the majority "of the bishops to define the infallibility of > the 'head of the Church, was to protect from denial or doubt > ithe- divine certainty on which 1 the' revelation of Christianity comes down to us; . bAUCatlm- lics believe that the Church, by the assistance of the Holy' Ghost, is infallible and therefore ; that all doctrines proposed by it for our' belief are divine, and for that reason1 certainly-true. But if the head of- the Church may ' err' iii!his teaching, doctrines may be proposed 'by him / that may not be divine, and would thefefore'be doubtful." Thus far writes the' Cardinal Arch- : bishop of Westminster. ! ; /< . ' >. 1 ! '" The logic_'of ' this" passage, "' says Professor .Friedrich;,' " is utterly, incomprehensible. "'If ' Hiri /Church 'be' infallible; and .' tiie" 'doctrines ' which it offers' us to' believe are divine truths, and on that account certaiyy.'<-,it:'is.'qnte'. inconceivable how the Pope 'is.requifjed fof the logical conclusion., All that 'follows ibgically from , the principles laid, down ' is 'only that if the "Church be infallible,' and its!' doctrines to be regarded as divine, arid certainly ' true, then the Pope is not infallible, and it'iscndt his place to declare doctrines' to ! be certainly!! divine and true ; and, more«ver, heoffera npguErantee.that the truths of the Christian revelation are corn- ;municated to us with divine certainty.' ! - On the ' contrary," there follows only ' what was ygreed on by the . Council of ' Constance! in ! its fourth and' fifth sittings. ' Dr! 'Manning's ''assertion has 1 a meaning "oiily 'if ' he, "'.with1 his theologian "who drew up the Schema de eccfesia, takes '' the ' Church ' as'; identical with the; Pope, and then follows 'this 'logical boncluSion— The' Churcli'is ' infallible 'the Popb "is the ChurchV th'erdfqrd tlie Pope is infallible. But the correctness 'of "the 'minor' mustynrely';be':proved, befdreu'the con clusion be alloweddo pass;". 'But Dri' Manhing and thh theol6gianl'dol not. themselv'es "admit tliat'the minor Is "correct, for they immediately aftdrwards Say,; A fallibie'liead' !tos an' infallible 'kody ' ."(that ;isf ,( the1' .ChurdB .' a'doctrine > which would ' soon giveaway' before' the "logic of common sense.' Consequently, the illogicalness of his conclusion still" remains; Regarding. the last assertion, we confess, to Dr. Manning 'that his doctrine," logically considered, would be 'an absurdity ; -but we must 'add that it" never1 . occurred to any one,'; before' Dr. Manning and' his'theoldgian to maintain' such nonsense. " The body stands in no such' oppo'sition !to tho head as he suppbses ; but the head .is a member of the body, and a body without a head would be- a maimed body,, 'as the theologian' and ' Dr. Manning admit in 'another place, - when they : make the minority say; ' Nobody "doubts that ' the chief member of the body is the'head.' If, then, Catholics; as Dr.' Manning " himself admits believe that the Church, which, indeed,: ' accordin<g to the Apostle Paul, is ' a hody, ' is infallible; then they must not at the same time maintain the logical nonsense that the 'body' is: infallible, the head fallible, but that the'entire body, head and members together, are infallible. : -But therewith Dr. Manning himself has admitted the declaration, that the 'majoi'itj7,'"oh" the ground of an illogical standpoint, compelled the Council to declare the' infallibility." 1 This is, he: says; 'the real' reason;'' <'.?. r ' 'l-;- -. ' Another' reason' which' agrees with the fore- foing is also adduced ; , the Popes have given ecisions as; to matters, of , faith." (It "was there- fore necessary-at length to determine ' whether "they (are infallible or 'not"! infallible; :;rt We'do'not "stop at 'this point' beeause it 'appears (to us" of importance, cprisidering.that'the Clnircli/ had existed. ' without any such "declaration for. . eighteen centur ies; but i n order again to seit forth one poiiit;; .the, 'Romish'" Cardinal's historical eriulitioti. ' ' HA says, \ainbng, other ; things' ; that' (the doctrine of the'Canoii -brthe : Holy' Scripture St infallible or not infallible'? ! This ( single - . passage proves that Dr. MannihgknbwAabso- ! Uutely nothing about theliistofy of the Canon1. Accrifdihg to the most recent . researches,' the Gelasiandecree initsoriginal'forin'was'is'surid by Pope Daniasus. We ask the cardinal if the decree of; Pope Daniasus is infallible' or; not?.- He will and must answer, infallible. ' But" tins Pope has expressly said of the three ' epistles" of John that only one belongs .to the apostle; arid "the other two to the presbyter John. Later, ; Gelaaiiis ascribed all ; the 'three to the apostle. Which of the two 'Popes was right, 'since both ®;ust, be : infallible ?. Dogma, as Dr. Manning puts it, must conquer history. But perhaps the cardinals will recommend for censure to the congregation of the Index, Hefele's History of the Councils, in which" these researches are set forth and regarded as correct." v .» :'"" ' EKEEDOM DEB ATE' IMPEDED, Violence and -tumults1 in the Council of the Vatican, according to'Dr. Manning, never occurred. Because in Pomponio.Leto there are some representations of events. -in the Council' said to be incorrect, 1 and because au Italian newspaper published a1 speech falsely ascribed to Strossmayer, Dr. Manning, assorts that .all else professed to be known concerning the Council was also false, and was invented, some ; of it, by the Italian newspapers, and chiefly -by the Augsburr/er AUgemeina Zeitung. Concern ing 'this invented speech of Strossmayer nothing need be said, more than that no Catholic with any measure of discernment ever took it for genuine. But what did happen to Strossmayer is not: on that account by any means set aside. 'In regard to Pomponio Leto, whose book certainly, as regards its contents, originated iwith the late Cardinal Vitelleschi, it is difficult to refute Dr.- Manning's statement, as he docs not say whether he had before him an Italian or an English copy;1 and where descriptions which he quotes are to be found. Dr. Manning, indeed, says that Pomponio Leto " graphically describes the. confusion of tho cardinals who pulled' their red hats : over their eyes." " The Cardinals had no hats red or otherwise, and the eye-witness is convicted of fabrication." Now, as this is said by Dr. Manning when he is speaking of ' -violence and tumults, one is naturally induced to look for the sentences' of Pomponio Leto, where he speaks of the!tumult against: Strossmayer or.- Schwarzenberg. But! there not- a word of them! sis to"'be ,foiind! I-Pomponioi Leto does hot say a, word about " Cardinal Schwarzenberg carried 'fainting -from ; the Ainbo to his seat," and that; ! " he''sa,w!;the servants;! outside' ' rushing , to r the doors; of - the Council, fearing for -the livessof their masters." What he saysds only that " on the noise in the Council hall some servants of .the fathers' in the iCouncil: wished toipress in in order, to help! their ' .masters, whom they believed; to be in.danger.'' But there is found in Pomponio Letdj in reference toithe voting of. the non-infallibilist cardinals as' they were considered in .the . fourth- sitting, the figurative expression "that they pulled" their vred hats over, their eyes, did- not . stir, and said :PZace<.?'in:Tql.stamp this >for a; crime,-. asi.Drl Manning does," > is ; more than naive. It-' is the 'same as -when by suchi objections he : thinks to iprove . that ithe work of Pomponio .Leto tis; uh; avorthy. of credit;1 ! ! >But th ere is> nb! need to! go ,to 'iPomponio Leto to, refute Dr;..

We agree with the cardinal that nothing should be heard of violence and tumults, but we should be justified in describing tlie wholo Council as one sirigle stroke of violence. This follows from all that has hitherto been said. Will Freeman no w (affirm that perfect unanimity pre vailed; as it did 'in- its article of last week ? THE DECKEE. OE THE COUNCIL NULL AND VOID. ,; When. the., infallibility petition was brought in and allowed to pass ori the 9fch of February by the commissions that were charged with it, then -it .< was ' 'confessed . that : the ma j ority were not quite sure of its -position: /.It was necessary to give their forced proceedings a legal charac- ter.-' '/This' was done -in the new order of busi ness of ";the 20th February, wherein permission was given- to tlio ' majority to conclude' the debates when they saw fit, and altogether, a numerical majority of :votes was substituted for moral unanimity. In vain did the minority formally ' protest against this proceeding in the petition of the 1st of March. In vain did it desire moral unanimity in its Observationes. Strossmayer had only touched this question when the storm was raised against him. The majority at orice demanded that the other pro positions be rejected, and infallibility be pro ceeded with. This was done, and short work was made of the propositions de Fide and de Ecclesia, although on the other side the minority on the 8th of May protested energeti cally; Already in the third solemn sitting in which the chapter de Fide was announced, the minority had been deceived. When it was suspected that the concluding clause of the decree, which speaks of Papal constitutions and decrees infallibility was concealed, the Commis sion on doctrine explained that this was not the case. In the infallibility debate Dr. Manning, however, a spokesman of the majority, main tained- that -infallibility was at least 'implicitly (coiriprised in. the clause, and, once admitted, it (was impossible to _ depart from it. Rightly says Archbishop Kenrick, on this' subject, either the 'speriker of the Coriiinission was himself deceived, ;.if'Dr. Manning was right, or he li'as consciously 'led ris.irito error. " But it succeeded iri' gaining :more' votes to the' decree.' : v / >; ii? . ; . Lromi ... this third sitting to /the fourth 'the insolence of the majority , knew no bounds.
