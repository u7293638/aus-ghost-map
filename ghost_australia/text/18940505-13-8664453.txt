Although during the past week British consols have lost, and are now quoted at par (for 2, percent, to he reduced in 1003 to 25 per cent.), nine colonial Government securities have risen 2 to J. The. quotations for the and per cent of each colony now compare with those at the close of 1871 as follows. Ure. -d Mrs J, _,._, min ! nail Raw V victoria New South Wales ApillOct Mitch sept. South Australian, I'uioti'dtiml .. New Zealand T isnianiaii ... A Inrsc recovery has taken place since the New Year, and there is no reason why this recovery should not be improved upon. The great thing now necessary in the unification of the debts of the four mainland colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia into one great stock. That accomplished, the consolidated stock, or say Australian consols, would quickly rise to a quotation yielding a return of not more than 3 percent, to the investor. If colonial Treasurers are not equal to the task of units- cation- and there is no reason to suppose that they are it would hens well to call in the aid of a scion of KotliBchild's house or of Mr. (iQsahpii. A few years hence it will be surprising that each colony followed the bent of his own SIM at will in the matter of public borrowing to the serious injury of credit.
