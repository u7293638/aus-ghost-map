?1?al©s & Steetclj,e» OLIVER OAKLAND. !/ I can't name the year just at this! mo ment, but it was early in the twenties,; when 1 matriculated ac St John's College,' Cambridge. The only man I knew there, except my tutor, was Oliver Oakland, afterwards known to the whole college as Noble Nol. We had come from the same ?quiet neighbourhood of Chelmsford, in Essex, where our families had been old times. Mine, the Westwoods, were well to do, ..haying , a respectable property in house and land, which T, being the only boy out of seven olive plants, expected to inherit some day. His consisted of his motherland himself. Their entire income was the pension allowed to a lieutenant's ?widow,. :and their expectations were ?Oliver's' wits. How he got first to school,, and then to college, was the wonder of all their friends ; but a small legacy left them : by a maiden aunt had been eked 'out by all sorts of endeavours of their own : the mother gave private', lessons to young Iftdiea; the son gave private assistance, to . young gentlemen ; and both made , harjd , , pulls— -very Hard they had to be — pn,*he .sympathies of their cousin, the rector, ?who .kept no curate, and farmed his glebe to. the; best advantage. Moreover, the ?OaJdands had a bencon-lighc to guide their honest ambition : over the mantlo piecq.in their. little parlour, aide by side with the deceased lieutenant,' who had. fallen in a far East Indian field, too young forbis son to remember Lim, tlioro hung -the portrait of a spur, wind-dried man, in unirersity cap iand'gown'^'Zachary Oak land'by name, a hard-headed scholar of ?ome note in his generation, wl.i h waB . long past, for, he was Oliver's grand-uncle, ?and had Jbeguh life a poor; student, but died the master of St- John's College. That portrait, and the Bour, wind-dried man it represented, were' the glory and. toe1 guiding-star of the -Oaklands, though it-Was traditionally said that the learned Ziohary had never exchanged word or «ign' with one of his family from his tweaty-firat birthday, when his father refused tofurmah funds' for the only bet he ; vtvi uwud m *uo i«o'-x uujibvi? lu-naa UKl a cock-fight-Randall his kindred approved , ? of. the denial -r ^ ^ -^ \,'. , The Master of St. John's had been . saving aV well '3sjlearfleayand was believed to.J!j.aTJB.:diedxj;ioh,vbufc:,1hpw.or,wljere he ... . had bidden his, money, -nobody could dis cover.

''We1 were Coming home one evening from A Jong ramble, and passing tbe Ohapohe Institution, an old-fashioned boarding; school: of great.Btriotnesa-and, high. gen- tility, kept by the maiden daughters of a iojmer.Bishop^otElyj and n.initid,I know, not wKy,' unless there was- Borne 'connec- tion in the case with {ho lady who wrote such instructive and unentertaining Letters to her .NieceT, when my eye was caught by a plainly-dressed but uncom monly pretty girl at the gate, who would have spoken to Oliver, if I had not been there. It was a true-love business, I knew by my frknd's eyes, which he could not keep from following her as she tripped up the Uwn and, into , the house without once'turmnghar head.', They we're very discreet .about1 it ; but 1 had told Oakland so many secrUs of mine, that I thought myself entitled to ferret out the only one lie had ; and a fair opportunity occurred on ' the following Saturday, 'when I had him in my rooms at siipper^a bumper of game having come f rom' VVestwobd Manor.

''She was an orphan, With out relations or friends, except the maiden ladies of the Institution, 'of whom her father, a poor curate', had been a' scarcely ' acknowledged connection, and to whom she had been junior assistant since the* beginning of her fifteenth year. ' She is little over eighteen now,' said Oakland-; 'but a- wiser or a better woman does not exist. You're laughing in your sleeve, I dare say, but Bessy could advise the. oldest man in the college for his good : women can do the like) if it be in them, without our books and universities. 1 , understand the ladies - of tho Institution can't' find a fault in Bessy ; and it must -bo a small; one that escapes them. I .never could have got acquainted with her ,but for a savage dog I had the pleasure and good-luck, to save her from one evening in the su turner before last. She has a hard life there between the old maids and the young, ladies they, teach, but she nover complains. I know the girl loves me, Westwood, and I can't think of living without her;, so, after I take my B, A., I'm going to dig into divinity. , My cousin the rector, will, want a curate some day, and I'll settle down to, the work, and marry Bessy.' : ' I never thought you had a turn for the church, Oakland,' said I ; ' but if there was a living in the gift of my family, it. should.! be' at your «ervice, though it : seems to me a downright burying of your talents, and I wonder what you? tnother will say.' ! 'I don't know,' said Oliver with almost a groan. , 'She has set her. heart and hopes on seeing me one of the college dons, and made many a sacrifice for it ; but the best girl in Europe would not pleas'e her for a daughter-in-law, without some, rank or fortune, and Bessy has neither.'

If he, can, let him reply to Cynthia at the! post-office; hia letter, will be, looked for ? with anxious, hope, received .with delight, and answered with expedition.' — - . - | My friend and I laughed heartily over the effusion, and agreed that it was a1 hoax ; but who was the perpetrator, : -I could guess -as ' little aa Oliver' himself.' Yet there was something in the writing, though 'evidently- a disguised hand, familiar to myfeyes. I thought and poured over it,- but could not fix on no-', body; and the mystery ? seemed to work upon Oakland, 'studious and' steady as he was, for he resolved to carry on the joko, and thereby find out hia fair correspondent, as we both felt sure the hand was that of a woman. Cynthia was answered on the spot,: in a strain as grandiloquent as her own.' She replied by the ' very poxt post, and' got another answer. Six or seven betters were thus exchanged, I being the on'.j outsider in the secret ; and the only point' that either watching or bribery could as certain for Oliver was, that Cynthia's let ters were called for. by a variety of ?rajrged boys, who, when they could bo got at and questioned, aaid sometimes ' an old woman had sent : them to the post-, office, and sometimes a young, lady. The correspondence did not advance, rapidly,, towards a solution. ., -My friend'; Was' always declaring himself able and willing to respond to any amount of. '.affection and confidence, while the lady, asTthoug]\t to lure him on, took up the strain of men being deceivers ever. But none ' of her, epistles closed without the 'hint growing plainer at every repetition , of .the riohs* and prosperity to which ihe could guide his steps ; and at last— it was li&e.a; drowning man clutching at,,a straw— poor' Oliver ee'emed toihilfj believe, that his gq'od fortune' was i6toehojtr-i[ to/come thjroiigh pyjithia, whenja1 curious wcident enabled melto unveil the charmer, j v, '? i^'At'ttejefld of (Tr^pingtoil-ser^tj/ijeVt jo'SfcyJohn'S Lane,^tfierp wa^jarthe/time; of ray story, and hafl been for many a year before, a shop of all- wares in the students' fanoy 'line; ^ Everything that college-men required in tlioiTe'days, from second-hand books to new boxing-gloves, might be boughtthere' ; steel apurB-for game-cocks, white kids for evening parties, pipes of every formjf r8mokiDg-caps,~: with dther goods too various to mention, made it the constant resort of students. The shop waB kept by a Miss Josephs, and a woman whom she plaaBed ' to icall her nurse,, but whom popular tradition. affirmed to be her mother. Miss Josephs was of an age not to, : be ? ascertained. . Her ' face ' had a re markable likeness to that of a parrot ; ' her figure strikingly resembled an upright deal board ;.ahe had a dark muddy com plexion, a considerable squint, and stiff black hair, said to .be daily thinned by plucking out the grey. Yet the prettiest woman in England could not have looked more certain of ' her triumph- over the hearts of men, or put ion more airs and graces for that purpose. It was a study of the ridicnlous to see her behind the counter, dressed in the. extreme .of the fashion, and talking like a fainting duchess. The students .one and all laughed at her ; and , throughout Cam bridge (I think it was the boating-men who gave, her the title), on account of a peculiar mode sho had of moving her skinny' arms, Miss JbsepuB was known aA th'e Steerer. i They laughed at and paid her extravagant (?omplimenta ; paid extravagant prices, too, for most of her wares ; the shop was convenient, and the credit long ; but the wildost or .most ', mischievous student never caredi to go further, great as the encouragement was 'for practical joking and burlesque romance. The Steerer's iiUrao— I never knew anothor name for her— was lucky in not living two centuries earlier, for she might have sat to, any painter who ,wanted %a , perf eot witch., , , ft was said there weire.iierce quarrels be tween her and the fascinating lady, always about money-mattera, '; ' in .^hioh(Ktheir' calculations Baldora agreed ; , but'.'iheyjad Iresael each' , 'other in; most ,. affectionate erma i in.puttfc^tfore strbng^estiinonjj to each other's virtues, kept no servant, and admitted nobody within their walls - except by special invitation, and such events were few and far between.

Though it was not very late,-, most, of the shops in Trumpingtoh-stroat were shut ; the Steerer'a door was, but her. window remained open. Through.it I remarked a man, not looking at goods, but at her, while he leaned on the counter in earnest conversation,, and a movement of his head showed me that it was my friend, Oliver Oakland. .'..'.: ??:;. I went home, not knowing what to think. Had his newly-discovered Cynthia really attracted ' ray ' friend,' - and ' made hint waver in his allegiance to the pretty BesBy?- If so, the promise to guide his steps to riches and prosperity must be the chief charm; 'yet how could Oliver, shrewd and sensible as he was, believe such a thing possible to a small shopkeeper in Trumpington-street ? The Steerer's gatherings could not be a temp tation to a man like him, yet I have seen Oliver earnestly engaged with her ; it was not the be^t or cheapest of her goods that brought him there at.BUch an hour; after warning me . to keep the subject of her letters out of the students' ears.' '; in my contempt and indignation at his deceit, I wished my word had not been1 given on that matter ; but given it waa, and nothing remained but to giVe Oliver the cold Bhoulder. I tried it for some days ; almost Weeks, indeed ; Oliver saw nothing of me, and I saw nothing of Oliver.1 Hedid not avoid me, so far as I could see'; 'but Tie did not seek me out : conscious 'guilt; thought ' [ ; but somehow the mail .'had' b'eebnie too leedful to my life arid ? mind ^ to' 'be' thus parted with.

He shook hands 1 With me'^aja warmly as if our friendship 1 had. never' cooled, and took hia accua-^ tomed. seat beside me. There was nothing wild Sr disordoriy in his look, but I knew he had something particular to say, and tl e next minute it came : 'Westwood, you are the best, the only friend I ever had ; and I want you to help me through a busi ness which few then have to d/» often.' BesBy and I are going to get married ' quietly and quidkly.i . You may stare, but it ia true ; I have the meana'tu'k'eep her handsomely ;' and Oliver's eyes seemed to dance with joy.' ' ' Don't be alarmed ;' j I am inmyrigntinirid, Wea'twood ; I have ' J got my grand-uncle's long-lost money, jj Listen ! The old follow had hidden it under the floor of the Butch summer house where he used to sit day and night they say, in his latter years ; and left a sort of will written in Greek, the ? purest Attic, I uasure you, bequeathing the whole hoard to hia next of kin, with particular; directions whore to find it. - The will— I ---^ don't kuow how— got into the hands of a dealer in w»ate paper, who sold it ' in a bale of his goods to our friend Cynthia, many yeara ago. I am not sure that the old witch behind the partition yonder don't use the like in the choice Havanaa she makes up.; at at any rate the bale was bought, and my grand-uncle's will in it. The Greek characters were beyond the Steerer's scrutiny, but the old master had written hia name at full length, in English letters, on , the back; and either the Fates, or the faculty for scenting out money, peculiar to her Jewiah race, made her keep it out of the Havanaa, and aafe in a private drawer.' It appears that Unfortunate fellow who got into trouble between her and the bed- maker's daughter, and' eacpaed .them both by the brain' fever, gave her an ' ink lingof its value, by the byfh'e could not have ' buen a good Grecian, or' there should have been little' for me to find.
