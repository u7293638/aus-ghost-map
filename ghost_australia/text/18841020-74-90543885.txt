VICTORIAN AMlTEUR TIURF CLUB. (roe ccis eRPEAn COnRESPONDENTS.) MLonsrtNE, October 19. The Spring Meeting of the V.A.T.C. was broiight to a 'successful termination on Saturday afternoon. Despite the treaten ing appearance of the weather there was an immense concourse of spectators, and the 'grand stand was inconveniently crowded.:' His Excellency the Gover nor, Sir H. B. Loch, Lady Loch, and suite arrived prior to the first race,and remained until after the Steeplechase was decided.Altogetherthe meetingstands outas the most successful tlsh Club have yet had. The racing throughout the day was very good, and the Tasmanian horses very suc cessful. The Cup brought out a field of 26, and Porgy started first favourite. He, however,could only gain third place,and the Tlas?nnian mare Blink Bonny came at the turn, µnd won comfortably, if not easily, in 2 mi. 40? sec;' the fastest time' yet .made for the Caulfield Cup." Thi Adelaide reprpsentative, Lord Wilton, yas :jr lengths off,second, while Malua ran agreat race, and was an excellent fourth. Blink Bonny was little better than an outsider, and started at 25 to 1. In the succeeding race,the Steeplechase, the Tasmanians also: -out a good figure, and Echo and Denmark? fihished second and third, while the former' was only beaten a head for first honours by the lightly weighted Struggler. In the concluding race, the Tasmanian-bred and owned Mozart defeated a good field' eily. The following are the details bf "the rhn ning;: SELLING RAE.-Of 100 sove.
