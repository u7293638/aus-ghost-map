How London Impresses. What (asks an English paper) is the most impres sive thing about London ? The collection of Jubilee visitors offers a chance for the inquisitive journalist to take a plebiscite on tbe point. Thequestions put by one writer to tbe Dyacks of North Borneo now quartered at Chelsea Barracks show that tbe rail ways, and particularly tbe Underground, aBtonish i them most. ' They could not believo it was ever made by men â€” going under in the dark, and rail ways going over them. It must be ghosts who did it. Men couldn't.' Then there is -the orderliness of the London traffic. Another iB the v.onderful way in which the London police manage theorowds. They are astonished at the obedience of the people. A policeman has only to hold up bis hand and all the people muBt obey, they say. They think thiB wonderful. Curiously enough this was also one of tho thing's whioh Mr. Bayard, locturing in America, said had Btruck him most about London. AlmoBt tho extremes of 'civilisation' meet in admiring the London policemen.
