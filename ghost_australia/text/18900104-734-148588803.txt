FOR TEE NEW I EAR. I buried tbe old year Bighing ; I laid it away with tears, With the pitiful faded blossoms Of the un forgotten yearsp And I turned to my lonely fireside p For 1 thought what the New would be, With only the ghost of gladness To walk through the world with me. 2 woke when the bells were ringing p Brightly the morning smil'd p And there 1 in the sunny doorway There Etood a gold-hair'd child. And Bhe Bang, as afar she pointed And her eyes to heaven were cast, " Be ever the roads so weary, They lead to iseace at last 1" â€”Exchange
