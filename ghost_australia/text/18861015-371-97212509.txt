''' IN MEDlis RES, Btthe Gjhost.— Paper I. 81nee I wrote my first' letter to yonr valu able p»pfcr I-hav*:been busy on the look-ont for news, and hearing that Mr. Wood Green was going to held forth in the Institute H»ll, Mallala, o^Supdey. I, went in . unobserved, and took *a cotnfortable seat on the wire over tho nWtfnrm an that. T rnliM hear nil ind not be seen. Mr. iGfeen. is iagobd speaker and a good ar^oer, onlyhe *ays Garding and Gospil when it is spelt 'Garden and Gospel. In the afternoon 'he spoke well. It takes a good deal to move a ghost, but I was im- pressed *wiflh Tain sermon. In the evening, alas, he spoilt my goo4 opinion of himself by laying sachtotreya on Baptism. It is no use tolling right-thinking m«n and women that if they are not baptised they will be lost. The inference then is that baptbrn is aalvati^a^- ? ffyit is, then' there was no seed of a Saviour. As a ghost I aay Mr. Green should have told the publio he was going to speak on--baptimtnj and ; then other places of worship fftight not have closed, and induced their congregations to go to hear him. The resnlt of the serrica was that an ' anxions ?nquirerf!^rrote f wo question* for Mr. Green to answer at Tuesday's public meeting, wanting « know where all those saints had gone -to who have died without adnlt baptism, but Mr. Green would not answer, WWieWironld, hewid, be very wrong to fo%|ie-i|g|M^naght be likejUiytting »« iresK^&fnl; f&f;?a mattej p^Ux*, the jhol teoofht le wI.gettinRadrw.ing down on Sunday night, and got so agitated that he nearly fell off his seat. In the meantime &k.; ^reenWiU try sad find oat where Mjirtin TJalbn and the Moravian mis slonsiies Save 'gone to,'' and where all the* martyrs have gone to, aad. let us know by ?piritnalism, bnt perhaps when he hears that a^bopt was listening to him on Sunday night be wul|begin to alter his mind, ^waiiacky in getting into the Primitive Church on Sunday uiorning last, for there ♦heltev. rfiaxicinson gave those aaintawho liaaijeenfipwt by fir.
