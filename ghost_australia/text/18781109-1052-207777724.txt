Macbeth is told -at page 168;" The Macbeth and Duncan are represented to have been cousins; the first a valiant gentleman but of cruel disposition, and the latter "so soft and gentle in his nature that the people wished that inclination and manners of the two to have been so tempered and interchangeably shared betwixt them that where the one had too much of clemency and the other of cruelty, the main virtue between these two extremities might have reigned by indifferent partition in them both. The play all along keeps close to the line of Holinshed, varying from it in scarcely any particular except in the nonappearance in the banquet scene of the murdered Banquo's ghost." !

Previous to that, on Aug. 25, 1858, at the same theater, there burst upon the theatrical firmament an Australian Roscius, Master Edward Pole, aged 14\. He also played the part, which as a feat of memory was extremely wonderful. This gentleman has long left the stage and become a "family man," and now follows the prosaic business of a thriving paperhanger.
