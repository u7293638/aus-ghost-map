' A LION'S HEART.' Although Messrs. Shirley and Lan.deck'e strong play has been eminently successful at Her Majesty's Theatre since its first production, Mr. Eignold having decided on rapid changes has resolved to remove it on Saturday next ; so that the public will only have five more opportunities of wit nessing this admirably- staged production. Its successor will be ' My Jack,' which, with Mr. George Eignold in the leading role, will be mounted on an extraordinary scale of completeness. Amateue Pkhpoemancb.â€” The Govern ment Printing Office Dramatic and Musical Society, whose excellent entertainments have already become quite an institution, will give a dramatic performance at the Royal Standard Theatre this evening.
