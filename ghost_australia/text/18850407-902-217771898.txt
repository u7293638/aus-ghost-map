A Ghost Without a Head. A headless ghost lias made its appearance nenr Ephratn, in Pemiayl vanuia, where it exciies considerable curiosity an l alarm. Tnere is 110 doubt whatever (writes ''St. James' Gazette," of January 17), as to its being a veritable ghost. It was first seen by the Rev. Daniel Wittier, when returning home one evening from the school-house in Manor township, where he had been preaching. Mr. Witner bad gone but a short distance when he saw coming towards him what he supposed to he a man carrying a lantern. On the nearer approach of the object he was, to use his own expression, " almost paralysed with horror" to find that it was a inoviug body with out a head. His tcrio" was still further increased on seeing the head carried in one of the bauds. ' The fearful object," he says," took its place by my side and accompanied me to my very door. How I managed to retain consciousness aud reach home I don't know. It was the most fearful experience I ever lind, aud I hope I shall never have the like again." The reverend gen tleman's statement is fully corroborated by two ladies and a Mr. Kaufman, who from a distance of about a hundred yards saw the ghost meet Mr. Witnei and walk away with him, but were too appalled by the spectacle to interfere. The ghost baB since been seen several times, and the nerves of the inhabitants of the district are described ns being in " a frightful Btate of ten sion." It is somewhat refreshing in these days of vulgar ' spiritual manifestations" to hear of a good old fashioned ghost without a' head, of whose blood-curdling qualifications there is no mistake. These headless ghosts were once common enough in this country, but have of late years become almost extinct. Perhaps they have all gone to America.
