CHAPTER XI. "When they are feasting and drinking they shall be conSumed as stubble."---Natem. i., 10. F. My son, besides those passages that ] have iquoted froin the s~cred criptures there are many others, a few of which' I shall:quote for your instruction. S. Thank you, father, I shall be most 'happy to hear'them. F. The Apostle St. Peter, in cautioning his disciples against the temptations of .the devil, says--' Brethren be' sober." Now the reason of this holy admonition is founded upon the words of our Redeemer, wvhich I have already given you, namely-'' Take theed to <yourselves, lest your hearts be ,overcharged with surfeiting and drunken ness, and that day comeo upon you sud denly." .Unless a .ian be given to sobriety it is folly for him to expect a participation in the grace of God, and, consequently, impossible for him to acquire eternal-salva tion. Though the Son of God has died upon the cross for his sake, thbugh.the Holy Ghost has descended upon him at his baptism and at his confirmation, yet so powerful are the effects of drunkenness, in the destruction of the soul, that he who is the slave of it, if he persevere, has no reason to hope for heaven. S. I wish, father, that all drunkards. knew those things. Iam sure, if they did, they would give up the evil practice. SF St. Paul, that great. Apostle of the Lord, in teaching us how we are to live, so as to please God and be saved, says-" Not in rioting and drunkenness," and in ano ther place he distinctly informs us-" that drunkards shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." I trust, my son, that your reflec tioin upon those sacred truths will be to you a safeguard against ever becoming a slave to intemperance. ,S. So I hope, father, with the grace of God.
