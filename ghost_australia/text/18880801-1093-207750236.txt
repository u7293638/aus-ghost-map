For when, at, some indefinite yet very remote period* , rehgion became blended, with govern ment, and. the; - priests -sought rather td control public affairs than to maintain a true worship, the religions-idea became so degraded that the Bun, which, was; originally only the symbol of a higher unseen God,? was. mistaken for a God itself, and worshipped as snch; and this degradation increased with ages;, until finally any one who could: build &■ sculptured sarcophagus-and pay fbn the- embalming' pro* - cesseB, ritualistic prayers, incantations; charms;, am* cerqmoniesj.was declared to be- iff Heairi ju8tmed.

There was nothing to be done in, the way of restraining ones self from evil* nothing to : be done in the way of active , benevolence. The. chief business, of an Egyptian's life'was to acquire sufficient wealth to build & coatly tomb. and the: moBt expensive event, in; a man's ex perience'.was his funeral.

Yet Ra is rarely asso ciated with a female consorf;;but, when ha isso, it ib always with a feinaIe Ra, and iiQvec with an inferior being. • But, even after this idolatry be* came established, the higher priests preserved ldea o£ ? dual god, to be made a triad by the- generation of a son ; and- every ™"0 EgyP], no matter by what local S£h?'r 8°d8 were called, thiB' trilbgy was ,r~ med ^ovory tonple. The very essence of one'^dfarinpmf«.t0J0ly' therefore» is the idea of one aual god that becomes a-trilogy by the" generation, of a; son, The1 same thing is true of1 nl? ^^ snsient form of the Tndian and Chinese polytheisms, Thou must'-'' perceive, therefore, thatm. the original faith of all the primitive natiotiB-the ©ivine Being is Father mother* which is one dual God,- and a' son If therefore,- the,.
