The annual meetings of the Congregational Union and illusion of Victoria were com moved yesterday evening in the Collins street Congregational Church by the delivery of un liiftu.'Urul address by theihiilriniin for their, inn Rev A Chisman There was a large attendance The retiring chairman, the Rev. Joseph Walker, upon" the pro feedings, and then made way for Mr. ("Rosman Mr GOSMAN, whose address was "frequently) applauded, said he desired first of all very sincerely to thank the Congregational Church of Victoria, through their ministers and representatives there assembled, for the honour they had conferred on him in electing him for the second time to fill the position of chairman of the Union The It yours that had elapsed BUHO he addressed them in that capa- city before had been years of steady work, and if their progress had not been equal to their expectations, still they had no cause for lamentation They were thankful for it but they had been able to accomplish, and the sunny hopefulness which filled their hearts, with the steady growth of their price spies far beyond their own ecclesiastical borders, bright well sustain their zeal in days to come, no matter what discouragements mightsuirocuid them If Melbourne were Victoria, or Vittoria the world, they would almost be tempted to be bcvuthutii content was impending him can historical Christianity and what was unknown us free thought, which would exceed in seventy all such contests in past ages The leaders of advanced opinions," of broad and liberal" views, would never be defeated it victory depended upon a good opinion of themselves If the leather was to come as soon as it was predicted, there was nothing that he knew of that they, us Congregation alists. had to fear Their creed was us simple and short us it could well be, but in subscription to that was not secured from their minister The controversies raging around them, so far as the. wore ecclesiastical, had then deepest attention, for had not Mr Jus tiiulligiiibiithnm,l!isliop Moorhouse', and the defenders of the Rev.

It was with the view of contributing somewhat according to his ability to the consideration of the digestion whether Christ was a infirm man, although a great prophet, or was what he claimed to be, the Son of God, that he had decided to address them that evening on the person of Christ in the light of history and modern thought. For every event in history we must seek a cause, from which cause everything like caprice or perversions of nature's laws must of necessity be excluded The law of progress or development ran through the entire system of nature, nor was then any reason why it should be suspended in connection with the history of mankind On the basis of rational theism alone it was admitted that history was the unfolding and making manifest the Divine idea and plan he proposed to ask what history with regard ing the person of Christ, with a view of ascertaining whether there had been any progress or retrogression in the human mind regarding Him, and whether history had contributed anything to the solution of the problem Going back to the first five centuries of the Christian era, we found that the church went through a series of severe and harassing persecutions Celsus and written against Christianity, and ridi culed the claim of its founder to be considered more than man. Heresy in the shape of Gnostiusm had woven her subtle web of unscrupulous speculations, in which, from different sides, both the manhood and the Divine nature of Christ had all but disappeared, and Ariaiustn had propounded the theory of a mere creature ought to line whom the Christians were accustomed to worship as God. Yet, by the time of the first General Council in 325, Christian thought had take a definite shape, of which the Nicene Creed was at once the evidence and expression During the short period under notice the Gospel was preached in every important town and city of the Roman Empire To sum up the evidence of these ventures we could say with some degree of confidence that the doc trine of Christianity was stronger than perse- cution, and that as a religion it not only survived the attempt to stamp out its literature and the historic documents from which it drew the materials of its life, but in an in- credibly short time it turned upon its perse cutors and put an end to the conflict by converting its [former enemies into its most intelligent friends The bold and fearless asser tion of the Council of Nice was not the result of a chance vote, but of calm and intelligent study of the original scriptures Here it might not be altogether out of place to inquire how it came about that in Melbourne, and in certain literary circles Arianism should be talked about as "advanced," and that its professors and advocates should get themselves to believe that they were a long way in advance of their more "narrow minded" and old fashioned fellow travellers To be a specimen or an Arian was, it appeared, an evidence of culture and liberality which the orthodox had neither title nor chum to a hut was the meaning of this singular and startling ur cumstance' If an opinion was worthless in proportion to its antiquity, Arianism had no claim to a higher value than Trinitarian ism If a doctrine was suspicious by reason of the large demand made upon our faith as contradistinguished from our reason, Arianism had no more to commend it to the understanding than Trinitarianism And it a doctrine was true just to the extent in which it directed the his and punched the heart, then he was quite content to it the palm of honour go to the doctrine that had proud to be the most valuable its practical results, Proceeding to notice what the history of the middle ages had to say, he remarked that it was within three times that the crusades took place that splendid outburst of popular and religious enthusiasm that some of the finest cathedrals in Europe were planned and executed, and missionary zeal brought distant nations under the influence of the gospel Devotion to the person of Christ was the common sentiment which underlay and gave specific distinction to the Christianity of the middle ages Dwelling on the person of Christ in the light of modern thought, he said that on the occasion of a recent lecture which he had delivered before the Young Men's Association, he was asked at the close whether in his opinion it was not more likely that the New Testament writers were themselves deceived than that the laws of nature should be broken by the miracles of Jesus The alternative was well and sharply put In this question, and it contained the exact issue between supernatural Christianity and modern thought. Science did not in so many words say, but her bolder advocates in- sinuated, that the supernatural would be sent to the Old Curiosity Shop, and only exhibited as a relic of human superstition For the light which science had shed upon every de partment of human thought, he considered the church should be thankful, and worship God with purer devotion in consequence Science had brought the kingdom of life within the grasp and sweep of its laws and principles, and while the doctrines of Creation or God in and behind every particle of matter had remained untouched, tho doctrine of special creation, which was the refuge of speculative scientists as well as dogmatic divines, had melted away in the great doctrine of evolution. Under the scientific method, demons had disappeared, and ghosts had themselves given up the ghost in the fate of her brilliant triumphs, what might we not expect from science in ages to come ? But Science had, in addition to being hopeful, become bold Some of her advocates believed that it was simply a waste of time inquiring whether Christ rose from the dead, as such a thing could not happen Others were doubtful, fearing to face the question, or at least the consequences of a decision, but there were others who accepted the fact on historic grounds, and who saw no contradiction between that belief and the accep tance of the most advanced theories of science To that class be was bold to say that he belonged. The vindica- tion of this position brought his ntl dress to a close He liad it down as fundamental that the scientific spirit must reign supreme in the investigation, and that the dogmatism of Science was as much to be deprecated as the dogmatism of theology. The supernatural character of Christ was a matter of history, or it was nothing at all It was unscientific to lay down here what was possible and impossible and then to weigh the evidence in the light of foregone conclusion Leaving, however, the solid ground of scientific investigation, they might vindicate their belief in the supernatural character of Jesus on the ground of reason and by the aid of philosophy. A vote of thanks was passed to the retiring chairman of the Union at the conclusion of Mr. GoBman's address. The regular business of the council will be begun this afternoon Our Korong vale correspondent writes - " The take-all appears to be prevalent to a greater or less extent on all sides One farmer is at present sprinkling lime on the affected patches, but the experiment has not had sufficient trial to prove what the result may be."
