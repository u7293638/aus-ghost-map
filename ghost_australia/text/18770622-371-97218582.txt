THE OPEN COLUMN. ? ? a ? ? ; MOEGAN THE PROPHET. « Consider the Prophet, or it may turn out aioss' . — OtB Saw. TO THE BDITOB Sir — Believing that your readers will 'by this time have had sufficient of Morgan's eccen tricities, I shall append to my foregoing re marks respecting a bright and prosperous future for Adelaide, tbejfollowing items by way of finis. Morgan has, I see, again rushed into print, this time, however, without giving those in terested, and who did expect something from the Gawler Prophet, the true gauge of his narrow and puerile mind. There is no need t» answer it since nothing ia advanced — not the ghost of an idea is found in the lot, the first of his letter simply means nothing', and the last part mejns lens. As to his abuse, I can estimate it at its full value and }au?h a« it. And jast because I have h't htm bard he cries out ' yon are vulear and insulting/ If Morgan is fond of stirring up mud he is likely to get plenty of it, and any amount of valgariy too. I have let him off easily this time just bee - use he writes so mr-ch like Byron, and is going to produce a poem (?) s-- much like Byron's that you won't be able to tell the dtff.-rence between them; but if he returns to the subject and abuses Adelaide and Adelaide people as he has done, he will get it 'proper,* as Mrs. Brown would say. For the presen*, Morgan, to quote his own choice and mot vulgar words is * .up a tree,' and has the worst of the argument. I shall always praise Soutb Australia as being the only colony of the five on these, southern shores which presents scope for the endeavors of all, and wh?re, if t'ie suggestions in your last leader on * Immigration* are carried out, there is room for ariluons of people. ; Morgan*^ rhymes have given us a taste of the quality of his coming 'poem (?) pn Mel bourne,' »JaA T shall wait in anxious ex pectantsv- f or : its pnblicarion. '€ bucking-' : Byro'ns of the Morgan type are plentiful enough in Victoria, aud they will do anything to ^et into print. What a glorious treat the T viewers of Mofgan'B doggrel wiUhave when it comes out, but I must, not anticipate. : . Morgan asks if ' I would like hjs photo- _ griph.* Having. tieen comniis^idned by Mr. Darwin to forward, photographs o£ Fpecimens of natural' history from Australia, I shall be happy to receive the, * missinir link.' and wUl last fail to send it to Mr. Darwin^ \fho I am ; elate willTecpgnise ft ad the arBclfrlong sought. -Du ^JhaUa's ^gorQla fade^ intd' insigniflcance ^before the ? missthg 'BplL' and wltii Darwin-i:; 5cty' 'Eureka.'1 Xid; -it jhai* lieen found Jab -. ?-''?'' *?' ?
