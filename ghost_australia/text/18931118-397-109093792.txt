THE AMERICAN HOUSE BEPBESENTATIVES. Some interesting psj-tioulars have just been published about the constitution of i the American House of Representatives. | Oat of 356 members 110 leas than 333 i were born in the United States; and the j House includes only 23 "foreign" mem bers, one being of English birtb, one of Sooteb, and, in spite of the enormous strength of the Irish vote, only eight being of Irish birth. There is one negro in the Chamber, a single patch of black in the sea of white faces; and very lonely and uncomfortable that solitary negro legislator mast be! The youngest mem ber of the House it 28, the oldest is 73. The early experiences of American legis lotors are, of conrse, very varied. They hare not all split nils, like Abraham Lincoln : but in early life fifty-fire of these lav-makers worked on a farm, tbirty-two taught school, eight were printers* apprentices, four sailors, and four clerked in country stores, two started as telegraph operators, four learned the trade of blacksmith, and two that of shoe maker. One was a coa) miner and two carpenters. The great feature of the House of Representatives is the enormous number of lawyers in it. The House in cludes only, fire doctors, eight bankers, and nine editors: but it has amongst its members no less than 207 members ol the Bar. Domestics are leaving Hampton Court Palace, because the ghosts of Henry VIIL's wires are supposed to baa&t; thfl rooms.
