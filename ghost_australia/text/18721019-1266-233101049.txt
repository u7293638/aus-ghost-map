? CARRICK. (From our own Correspondent.) A lecture was delivered by the Rev. N. Bennett to a respectable audience, on Thursday evening at the Wesleyan Chapel, on "Epitaphs." Mr W. Stokes in the chair. The lecturer informed his audience that for years past while travelling he had been in the habit of visiting church yards and collecting epitaphs ; also lie had culled a number from the Monthly Review and Literary Journal 1771, he said that it was doubtful if the Jews wrote epitaphs on their tombstones, the " Pillar of Rachel's Grave" lie believed contained no inscription in the shape of an epitaph. The early Romans and Saxons permitted epitaphs to be written on the tombs of eminent men only. Mr Bennett then gave examples of the different kinds of epitaphs, and classed them under the heading of "affectionate relations, humorous, &c.;" While giving examples under the last heading he kept the audience in roars of laughter ; while describing those epitaphs which ascribed to the dead virtues they never possessed while living. Mr Bennett instanced that of Dunn the bushranger, and said that never before were the beautiful lines of Heber so basely prostituted, and that it was no wonder that a clergyman Once wrote on the gate post of a Church-yard :— " Here lieth the dead and here lie the living. With regard to the " Profane" epitaphs, Mr Bennett said it was a strong proof that there were no ghosts ; if there were any they would surely erase the whole of these epitaphs from the face of the earth. A vote of thanks was passed to the lecturer by acclamation. Early this morning (Friday) the Steam mill was discovered to be on fire, but the flames were fortunately extinquished before they had a proper bold on the building, or did much damage. Had it been discovered a few minutes later, it is probable that by this time it would have been reduced to ashes, as we have no facilities on tliis township to put out fires—not so much as a long ladder.
