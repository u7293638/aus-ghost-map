SYDNEY DIOCESAN COMMITTEE. The anniversary meeting of this Society took place on Tuesday evening, pursuant to ad- journment, in the Infant School- room, Castlereagh street. The LORD BISHOP of SYDNEY, president of the Society took the chair shortly after seven o'clock. On the platform we observed the Lord Bishop of Newcastle, the Chief Justice, the Archdeacon of Cumberland, Robert Camp- bell, Esq., M. C., the Rev. R. Allwood, &c;, The attendance, we regret to say, was not numerous, and considerable delay took place before the business of the evening commenced. Shortly before eight o'clock, however, the Right Rev president opened the meeting by prayer according to custom, and then pro ceeded to address the meeting. THE LORD BISHOP. It was a duty devolving him to offer a few observations on the business which was to be brought before them this evening. These observations would, how- ever, be very few, for as the report would show the business transactions of the Society was very limited, compared with what he hesitated not to say they ought to be. The operations of the Society during the past year had been few in number, but though this was the case, the importance of those operations must not be overlooked by the true friends of the Church. The objects of this Society were four-fold: first, the erection of churches; second, the establishment of clergymen; third, the foundation of schools in connection with the Established Church of England and, fourthly the distribution of books, which should, from the instruction and information they would afford, excite a Christian and religious feeling, throughout this community. With regard to the latter object, he could speak from personal knowledge of the good which had been effected. Though their Society in its exertions during the last vear had met with but little success in the erection of church buildings and establish ing clergy in the various districts of the coun- try yet in the distribution of books-of the Bible it had done much, and he earnestly hoped that even this limited amount of good would induce the friends of the Church to give the Society the means to extend its sphere of usefulness far beyond what the contributions of last year afforded. It was with regret-with deep regret, that he felt himself compelled to say, that there seemed to exist a want of en- ergy amongst the members of the Church. A deficiency in that conviction of the truth of Christian principle which ought to prevail. He saw this, and was sorry to say it, in high places. Those who had influence, who had wealth, who had power, were tardy in affording to the church that support which he believed their own con- science told them she demanded at their hands. There was an apathetic feeling with regard to the church-a disposition to neglect that duty to religion which was paid to all human ordinances. There was a forgetfulness of the fact, that from him to whom five talents had been given, five would be required, as much as that one talent would be required for the one only talent that had been given. It was, he repeated, with deep regret that he made these remarks, but he felt it his duty to do so. If there were not something of this apathy easting they would not find this Society, famed for the express purpose of pro- moting that Christian knowledge which is the light and glory of the world, neglected as it seemed now to be. He believed that this apathy did not arise from any decay of religious principles, or of attachment to their glorious Church. On the contrary he was fully convinced that a very large amount of deep and devoted attachment to the Church of England existed in the colony, and that the love and veneration they felt for that Church need only to be excited properly, and that it would then find full developement in the works which it was the end and object of this Society to promote. He would now call on the Reverend Secretary of the Society to read the Report and the letter he had addressed to the Committee. The Rev G. F MACARTHUR then read the Report, and also the Bishop's letter, both of which follow: Report for 1851. The Managing Committee, in entering upon the 16th Annual Report of the Sydney Diocesan Society, regret that they have not been placed in a position by the Churchmen of this diocese to complete various projects of usefulness which have occupied their attention during the past year. Your Committee cannot but feel thankful that there is a large amount of exertion being used in the several parishes and districts of the diocese: but although this testifies most pleasingly to the fact that there is a noble desire to perpetuate the Church's ordinances influences the members of the Church in particular localities, yet there is little recognition of that enlarged and Christian principle whereby we learn to look, not every man to his own things, but also to the things of others. Appendix No. III shows the truth of these observations; we there find only two instances this year where the general wants of the Church throughout the diocese were con- sidered to be of sufficient importance to justify the re- mittance of contributions from parochial sources. With these preliminary observations your Committee proceed to render an account of their stewardship during 1851. CLERGY Your Committee have on this occasion better reason to enter upon the subject of providing additional clergymen, inasmuch as it has been their privilege to promote this all-important work. By saving the expense of an office-keeper your Committee have been enabled since October 1st, 1851, to appropriate the sum hitherto paid for his services towards the stipend of a clergyman who is not in the receipt of any support from the Govern- ment. Under this division of the Report it will also be proper to mention, that owing to the withdrawal of the Chaplain from Darlinghurst Gaol, consequent upon the refusal of the Legislative Council to vote the usual salary, a most important portion of the Church's work was left wholly unprovided for. The Lord Bishop stated to your Committee the great difficulty with which he had to contend, when it was resolved to appropriate a grant of fifty pounds (£50) per annum, as part mainte- nance for a Catechist whose duty it should be to in- struct the unfortunate prisoners confined in that gaol. At a later period of the year the Lord Bishop brought the state of the prisoners at Cockatoo Island, also the inmates of the Benevolent Asylum, and the Female Refuge, under the notice of your Committee, when it was determined that twenty pounds (£20) should be placed at the disposal of the Lord Bishop, in order to enable him to employ a second Catechist, whose duty it should be to afford religious instruction to the prisoners at Cockatoo Islan, on every Sunday an Friday, also at other times to the inmates of the Bene- volent Asylum and Female Refuge. It has become the painful duty of your Committee to record the deaths of two much respected clergymen, whom the Divine Head of the Church has called from their spheres of labour -- the Reverend Thomas Wall Bodenham -- late chaplain to the immigrants, who was for some time the secretary of this Society; and the Rev. George Edward Gregory, late minister of St John', Canbury; Mr. Gregory was actively engaged in the zealous discharge of the duties of his sacred office, when in making an at- tempt to cross a flooded stream he was drowned. The following appointments have been made during 1851. The Rev. John C. Grylls, Incumbent of Holy Trinity Church, Sydney, having returned from leave of absence; the Rev. George F. Macarthur has been appointed to St. Mark's Church, Alexandria North, vacant by the resig- nation of the Rev. Henry Cary; the Rev. Thomas H. Wilkinson has been appointed to St John's Church, Canbury, vacant by the death of the Rev. George E. Gregory; the Rev. Henry Elliott, to the Albury District; The Rev. John D. Merewether, to the Edward River District; the Rev. H. A. Palmer, to Christchurch, Sofala; and the Rev. Charles F. D. Priddle, Curate of St James'; as Acting Chaplain to Immigrants. The Rev. William B. Clarke, having obtained leave of absence in order to undertake, at the request of the Government, an im- portant scientific survey, the Rev. Elijah Smith, who arrived in the Diocese in the month of July, has been appointed to officiate at St. Thomas', Willoughby, during his absence. Mr Clarke officiates during his travels wherever he finds it practicable. The following Ordinations were held during 1851 -- The Rev. William J. M. Hillyar, B. A., admitted to the Holy Order of Priests on ___ 1851. Mr. Henry Alfred Palmer, admitted to that of Deacon on _____ 1851. CHURCHES Only in one case have your Committee been enabled to vote money in aid of this object. At Appin, the mem- bers of the Church of England exerted themselves in a very commendable way to effect certain necessary im- provements in their Parish Church. Your Committee felt the greater pleasure in being able to assist in the work, because they found that the population was in a great part composed of those who were in possession of very scanty means. In consequence of the very unsettled state of the colony, owing to the gold discoveries, your Committee anticipate that considerable difficulty will be felt before the several churches now in course of erection can be completed. Yet with all this discouragement, there are to be found cases where the settled determination of the people to complete the House of God has induced them to us every effort to prevent the progress of the works being retarded for want of funds. Your committee cannot conclude this section of their Report without expressing their heartfelt thankfulness for the liberality which has been extended to this Diocese, during the past year, by the Parent Societies. The venerable "Society for Promoting Christian Know- ledge" voted the sum of One Thousand Pounds (£1000) to be applied whenever required, to the erection of St Andrew's Cathedral. In addition to this munificent vote, the "Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts" voted Five Hundred Pounds (£500) per annum for three years, in order to meet certain engage- ments previously contracted in the furtherance of Church Institutions in this Diocese, as well as to aid the Lord Bishop in other efforts to propagate the gospel amongst us. SCHOOLS - under the head of Schools, there is indeed a great deal to which your Committee would refer with feelings of thankfulness. Amidst much opposition the Church of England Schools have gained for themselves a high place in the estimation of the people: notwithstanding the very great difficulties which have been felt in se- curing a sufficient supply of competent teacher. The gold fields have been a temptation too great for several of our masters to resist, now, more than ever, has the office of the parish schoolmaster heroine one of trial, requiring great self-denial, and the absence of desire for temporary gain or worldly applause. Your Committee have voted grants, either in money or books, to Schools in the following places: Pennant Hills, bt {.forge's Parish Vlcnanglo (C anidt n side), The Oaks , Drowu low Hill, Chippendale Bungonia, and Jacqua. liront the official returns furnished up to December Jl, 1851, it apiicars that their is un aetuil dall} attendance of J105 clillilnn who are re cuing a gounl secular and religious idu> ntiou throu"'h tlio instrumentality of thoso Church Schools iu this dlocoio which ni elvo aid from the Govern- ment Your lonimittio desire to impress upon those »ho are iutertstid in the ctucso of Christi m education th it tia above Is the actual dully attendance, and not the total number of children who receive education at these schools 11 o a tual dallv attendance » in found during 18JU to be between one third aud one fouith less than tliu number on tlio books ', so that taking tin» same proportion for IS ii, it would shew that as there is nu actual atten iimci! i very day of not children, there must 1 e some« hi re nbout-iOUU children under education lie sides those there ale numbers «ho receive it e mihi oelur uion in those Clime li of hnglaud schools which are not upon the Government list The subscribers will be gratifie 1 to li am that at the VnuilVIcctiiigof Hie citj and suburb m schools, held at SI I unes' (burch, on Trinity tuesday last, no less than 1WI7 eluldicii viere pre eut.

Drought down to the end of the year 18o0 On reviewing the couue of myemplojment dunng 1SÍ1, although I have not been sta- tionary or inactive, yet have so few events oc cinred of ma ked linpoi tance in the history of the Church, that my Report, ns I sensibly teel, can scarceh bo made deserving of the atten- tion of the Committee Passing, therefore, hastily over the record of my own engage- ments, I shall endeavour in some degree to render it A aluable as affording a foundation for such observations as m the course of mj pro- gress I have been led to make on subjects connected vv ith the welfare of the Church and the extension of religion It is possible that some idvantage may hereafter arise from having these observations preserved perma- nently on record During the early pait of 13ii, I remained uninterruptedly in Svdney, not wishing to enter upon any other en gagem"iits unt 1 tlia arrangements connected with the purchase and outfit of the ve sol, which it had been determined bj the Board ot Missions should be purehised and presented to the llishop of New Zealind, should be com- pleted 1 his having been effected by the em- baí kation of the ¿ishoji of. Newcastle on AsccnsioiDiy (29th Maj), I was enabled to apply myself to the more immediate affairs of my own diocese Having therefore issued the usual notices of confirmations to be 1 olden tlnoughout the county of Cum Ibeilind, I commenced my visitation on the I 14th July, nul proceeded to Liverpool, Denham ' Court, Campbelltown, and Appin, intending from the latter place to proceed through the district of Illawarra. But owing to a heavy fall ot rain, on arriving at Broughton's Pass, I found the river so deep ¡ and rapid as to render crossing dangerous. For the time, therefore, my progress in that direction being stoppst!, I turned towards Mulgoa and Penrith ; thence to Windsor and ¡ Richmond, and down the Hawkesbury to Wise- man's Ferry. I cannot but interrupt these details, for an instant, to record a good work done by this Committee, in providing ^jointly with the diocese or Newcastle), during last year, a new boat, for the service of the clergyman sta I tioncd here. I looked with some interest on the relics of the old one, which lay on the beach worn out, evidently with hard work. It was oiiginally supplied by the late Church and School Corporation, ond ha* rendered much faithful service, during tb/; years that have s;nce passed by. I had myself, and much more had the clergymen who hâve succès ively be jn resident here, employed the set vices of this little bark in traversing the river to vi-it miny secluded spots which could not otherwise have been reached, and in offering this last tiibute to so useful a servant of the Ch ireh, I am happy to think, that (chiefly) through the ex- ertion of this Committee, a succcsso.- has baen provided, by which I trust the hiboars of the ministry may b2 effectively assiste!. Hence ' continuing the series of confirmations at Par- ramatta and Prospect, I returned to Sydney ' about the middle of August. On the 23rd of September, I commenced a more distant tour. I Proceeding first through Illawarra, which Iliad previously been compelled to omit, thence by , Penrith, where I laid the foundation oí a now | school-house, to Bathurst, officiating in All I Saints' Church, on Sundays the 12th and 20th, and at Kelso on the 19th of October. The In- terval of nearly three weeks was occupied (so fur as the attention due to the wants of the I immediate neighbourhood would permit), in collecting and preparing materials and furni- ture for the church which I purposed to pro- pose the erection of at Sofala, on the Turon, where the assemblage of persons attracted by the discovery of gold was too considerable not to awaken anxiety and to call forth my best exertions for their welfare. To this place I proceeded on the 31st October, and remained until the 13th Novem- ber. On the 5th, at six in the morning, the erection of the first support of the Church took place. On Sunday, the 9th, so much progress had been made that with the aid of a few tem- porary seats accommodation was afforded within the building for more than 200 persons ; and others, approaching to 100 in number, remained without, but quite within hearing of i the services. The Prayers were read, morning and afternoon, by the Rev. H. A. Palmer, I who had arrived here with me to be placed in i charge of this singularly constituted Church ; and the sermons were preached by myself. I On the 13th the Church was again opened, I (with evidences of a much nearer approach towards completion, the communion table, with its covering of purple, the chancel rails, the font, and pulpit, being all arranged in their proper places As the only formal con- secration which seemed appropriate for a building of such a temporary construction, I placed upon the ridge over the east end the symbol ol the cross, declaring the place to be set apart for the worship and service of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which was then proceeded with On this occasion I preached (Mark xv 26), and administered the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, as the httcst and most solemn inauguration of this holy place - the first which w as ever reared in that remote, and until lately almost unheard of wilderness With reeret I wit- nessed a very small attendance on this occa- sion, contrary to the expectation which I hod indulged, that it was of such a character as would infuse ardour into even the coldest heart, and impel every one belonging to the Church of England, not hindered by insuper- able impediment, to take part in a solemnity upon which every one engaged in it must to the end of his life look back with a feeling of religious awe and thankfulness But we must not expect a too speedy growth of religious loeling among a people too generally untaught and untrained to -value such impressions Wc have done much through the divine goodness m arresting the profanation of the Sabbath by the continuance of labour in search for gold But the employ- ment itself, as I had reason to fear, is not one which tends to spiritualise the mind, or to create a feeling of the superior \aluc of things eternal above those which are of the earth earthly , and tnerefore h iving sown the seed, we must wait with patience the arrival of a season when the fruits of godliness and dev o tion will be íendercd in more abundant mea- sure Pioceeding on my way I reached Mudgee , thence visiting in company vv ith the Rev James Gunther the region ot Louisa Creek and the Meroo, w here much gold has been found The assemblage of persons em ployed in search of it vv is rather considerable , but I had no means of doing more on the in staut than to mark the feite for a futuie churcn, and have since placed the distnct under charge of Mr Gunther, whose zealous feelings and habits of activity will embie him, I tiust to render most important services (although they can bo but occasional) to those firre mote members of our one body Crossing the country I caine to Wellington , but finding the neighbourhood so dispeopled by numerous removals to the c^old distncts as not to afford a field for any important exertion at present, I proceeded onward, purposing to reach Ophir, another of the gold pioducmg region*- But, ovv ing to misinformation as to the distance, and the state of the roads, being unable to accom plish the lourney, I reste 1 at Orange, and on Sunday, 23rdNovember, olhcitted to a luge respectable congregation in the Court House Here I remained a day or two, hop ng to col lecttogethei some well vvisheis to the caus" of religion and morals, who would combine for the erection of a church and stationing of a clergyman here, where 1 oth are much needed, But the tffort vv is ineffectual No such dis position manifested itself, and no meeting could be held Passing over the îemainder of my journey more rapidly on paper than could be accomplished overa country for the most part very rugged, and under constant e\ posure to heat vv hteh w lthin my know ledge had seldom if ever been exceeded, I m ty state that the course was first to Carcoar, where I pieached on the 30th November, thence across the country to the Lachlan, which there w is some difficulty in crossing, the stream being so deep as to run through the cam ige , alter wards by the stations of Mr Scarr Mr Mill brook Marsh, and Mr laafe, to the Melbourne road near Gundagai At the latter place I rested some days, preparing the candidates who presented themselves for Confirmation, and officiating on Suudav, the 7th of De- cember, but having no better place for the celebration of God s worship than the best inn s best room On the 14th, preached at Wagga Wn0ga Thence proceeded through the Billabong country tow ards Mon! imem, and after a fatiguing journey, and having been forced to spend one night m the open air, reached Mr Kennedy s station Here I was joined by the Rev J D Mcrevv ether, the ' clergyman who has been placed in charge of the western portion ot the Murrumbidgee Dis tnct, and for the purpose of holding personal communication with whom I was principally directing my steps to Moulamein Having therefore accomplished my chief object, and finding theie was no other which urgently re- quired my attendance in that thinly inhabited quaiter, I determined to proceed no further in this direction, and turned back towards Albury Here, after encountering many dif- ficulties, and spending another night under the canopy of heaven, we arrived on the 27th, and on «he following day (28th December! I preached in the Court house, and there also confirmed several and administered the Holy Cjmmunion-not I must avow, without some painful feelings at the want of suitableness in tile place and m the arrangements But there was no alternative, and my reliance under God, is upon the Committee established here to collect and apply contributions for erecting a church and providing a stipend for the clergyman 1 he Rev II Llhott is stationed here, and assisted me on this occasion 1 hence I bent my course homeward by Mullinjandra, Tarcutta, and Gundagai At the latter place, I rested and officiated again, and this time more eommodiously, in a building now vacant which had formerly been used as a Court House Ihe forwardness of persons here to attend the confirmation, and many of them the Lord s Supper afterw ards, w as trulv encouraging Of course the office of examining those who de- sired to be confirmed devolved here, as in other pi ices, upon myself and I cannot witl - hold my testimony that more willing minds or moie generally sufheient acquaintance with the design and ndv antage of the ordinance, I have not met with ni any place Hie attempt to establish a clergyman here, which w is m ide last vcar has filled, ovvini, to causes which it appeared to me might, by the exercise of a little better judgment and more lorbearancc, have been avoided. But it is my earnest hope that ere long I may be enabled to provide the services of a clergy man for Wagga Wagga, Tumut, and this place unitedly, and may find, on the part of the resident«, a disposition by joint contributions to prov ide for his support From this point my journey was directed to Sydney , vv licre I arrived n safety after a jour- ney of four months' duration, w anting only four days , and could scarcely return worthy thanks to the Author and Pre«erv cr of Ufe for having led me, in perfoct health and exemption from every evil accident, through n progress of con- siderably more than 2000 miles Having thus submitted to the Committee an outline of the cour«e which my travels during the past year led me over, I will avail mvself of this founda- tion to set foith some remarks which presented themselves to my thoughts during my progress. Beyond the more immediate duties of preach- ing the words of eternal lif> in places where except through my coming it could scarcely be ever heard, administering the Holy Sacra- ments, where, for w ant of a settle d ministry, they would hardly be had, confirming those who aro come to years of discretion, and ad- ministering according to my eng igcnient, the godly discipline of the Church, gre it advan- tage, I believe, both may and eloes arise from the opportunity thus nftoided to a Bishop of acquainting himself with the pnntipal wants and defects prevailing among the members of his flock, and of suggesting the most effectual methods for their removal It has pressed itself very deeply upon my observation, uid has awakened corresponding feel- ings of regret, that there is at this time M entire cessation of Church woik in all parts of the country through winch I have passed , and these, it will be observed, in- clude almost the entire diocese, with the ex- ception of the southern countie«, and district of Maneroo During 1851 not a church was consecrated , and I believe the foundation of one schoolroom only was laid Two addi- tional clergymen have been ordained, while (our exiBtinir, number has been in the same degree diminished by two deaths. I have therefore returned from this extended survey, I with an impression upon my mind, that during twelve months there has been no extension given to the Church, but that it remains in | the midst of a vast and growing population, continually more and more unequal, by com- parison, to fulfil, among those committed to to its charge, the proper obj'ect of its institu- tion, " to preach the Gospel to the poor." This discouraging state of spiritual interests can never be remov.-d or remedied, until some higher and more sanctifying influence than they are yet under, shall have impressed upon the minds of Churchmen a deeper sense of the obligation they are under to devote in propor- tion, according to each man's several ability, a portion of their -worldly possessions to provide for the religious wants of the Christian com- munity to which they belong. It must be, moreover, obvious to any one who possesses, and will avail himself of, the opportunities which have fallen to my share of noting how such efforts work when they are made, that the great cause of failure is want of combi- nation. Instead of individual self-will, we require a central moving power, wrought by intelligent, zealous, and unprejudiced men,'who, taking a view, without favour or affection, of the claims of all will set themselves equitably to disburse, in consideration of the real strength of every such claim, the funds with which they are provided for promoting Chris- tian knowledge, which it is not good for the souls of men to be without. But they arc in a fearful number of instances, deplorably and fearfully without it. I have seen this with my own eyes. I have ascertained it by my own personal observation. I report it to this Committee, not as meaning to imply that its members, individually and collec- tively, are not ready and eager to employ their utmost means in promoting the sacred object of imparting such knowledge, far from it ; but I express myself in these terms j in the hope of attracting attention to the state of things which is rapidly growing up' and be ecming fixed m tins community, in the hope of attracting the attention of those who, it they will, are best able to afford a remedy, men in high station, men of wealth, men of influence, who hear perpetually, and who in their con- sciences know that such a state of things ex- ists, and y et cannot be induced by any re- monstrance to remember that this Committee would afford, if it were even moderately supported, the machinery which is required to establish a system of voluntary support for the Church, and in combination with other local associations similar in constitution and design, would maintain that system in activity. In the principal districts whore digging for gold is carried on, the Government has volun- tarily, a'id very much to its honour, made a provision out of the produce of the licenses, which enibles me at two of those places to station cleigyraen, and to afford at the others the great blessing and advantage oi periodical visits fiom the ministers of other parishes, so that the multitudes may not be entirely shut out from the sound of the gospel, nor from the administration of its ordm inces. In the | pastoral districts no corresponding allowance has been established. Bu , I trust, on a fan and respectful lepresentation being made, the I Government will perceive that the princip'e having been y lelded in the one case, there can be no justifiable ground for refusing to yield it in the other. If the rule of equity require that from the produce of the gold revenue provision ' should be made for the maintenance of clergy - men and churches, then, the same rule being applied, the conclusion cannot be resisted, that out of the receipts for ^«jstoxi/licenses, pro- vision should no less be made for the equal benefit of those from whom the land revenue is i collt eted I use the expression no less, but in I realit' the words much mo>e would be more appropriate, for it may readily be conceived j how much more able the diggers for | gold would be to maintain their own clergy, than can be the case with the settlcrsor squatters in those wide districts over which I have lately passed. The one of these classes is collected in large masses , and these by a very slight effort of combination and liberality might set apart sufficient to provide for a mnnstei whose duties would be confined vv lunn a very moderate circuit But the squat- ters and their dependants nie in a state of the extremest contrast. They form a society (if society it can be called) broken up into mere fragments and infinitesimal atoms Frequently I have fount, that vvheia even the best disposi- tion to make a joint contribution prev ailed, that disposition was foiled by the physical im- possibility of associating together in sufficient numbers to provide an income for aclerg\man, without at the same time lay ing out a field of labour so wide that no one man's bodily power" could be sufhcient for its due superin- tendence lhese are conclusions which my extended mtorcouso with the residents m these districts has led me to arrive at I will offer no other observation than that such a state of things appears to me to point out plainly what is the dutv of the Government which draws so large a revenue from the pastoral population In aid of the resources which might be afforded from that rev enue, augmented as they would be by tbe private offerings of the peop'e for whose benefit that public grant would be ex- pended, the contributions of this Committee, if it had funds, would come in mo it appropriately for the promotion of its own pecular objects - prov lsion for clergyman, churches, schoo's, and books. These things arc all most lamentably required , and as the sin of not providing them must be laid at some one's door, I would earn- estly e\hort every one. to examine for himself whether it can justly be laid at his. In reflect- ing, as I have done earnestly and incessantly , on the best means of rescuing these dwellers in the wilderness, and their children even more than the parents, from the advances of unbelief and even total lgnoiance of Christian doeliine, ono suggestion Ins presented itself to my mind which may, I trust, through the Divine blessing, h ive some tendency to abate the c-y ii of which I am thus apprehensive The mea- sure I am speaking of" is that of publishing periodically, month by month, a collection of four or five short and plum sermons , fitted for the instruction in righteousness of them that have a lodging place in the wilderness. Even there the people that are left of the destroyed may lind grace This design is so far matin ed that I expect to be prepared for its commencement on Laster Day next en- suing If it meet with moderate Biippor*-, and an effective agency can be organised for carrving out the dotai s at a distance, I have no doubt of the practicability of the design , and much hope of its useful effect, provided it can be continued through one or two \ears nt least The expense need not be very sen ous if the pi in meet with encouragement, and I should with confidence appeal to this Committee to attempt the establish ment of a special fund for accomplishing a design from which, without being too san guine I trust we may anticipate important benefits And now there rem uns but one other subject upon which, though not unac- companied with sorrowful emotions, I should not hold myself excused, if I did not bestow a few words of symp ithy -a feeling which I am sure will be reflected back with emotion by every member of this Society I am alluding to the privation sustained by ourselves and by the Church at large in the deaths during the past year of the Rev Edward George Gregory and the Rev Ihotms Wall Bodenham the one by an aw fully sudden stroke , the other after a long and lingering decay of nature Both of them I mav speak of as my children in the Gospel, from the frequent and continued opportunities of intercourse close and confi- dential which I had with both during the sea- sons of their preparation for holy orders, to which they were admitted by my hands With the former I w as called by imperative duty to exercise m one instance that rigorous severity winch the Lord hath given us for edification and not for destruction He understood its design, and it was, I be- lieve under God, the means of establishing linn in that faith which h id beenso injuriously tampered with, and of rescuing him from thut fatal delusion to which he had for a time sur- rendered his too imaginative understanding With your permission I will introduce n quo tatton from a letter which was addressed to mc after his death, by one of his pa- rishioners, who knew lum well, and loved lum sincerely, and had derived comfort and in- struction from his ministry. ' I beg to offer, ' these are tho writer's words, " a just and sincere tribute to the memory of him we havo lost in BO melancholy a manner He was zealous and energetic in the discharge of his duties , affable, kind, and humble in his deportment , his own convenience or comfort w as quite a secondary consideration -with lum when he ould be use ful to either rich, or poor, and he had, during his short sojourn among us, gained the esteem and respect of all classes, and will long be deeply regretted. He began well ; and had it pleased the Almighty to have spared him to us, he promised fair to do great good. His duties on this side of the river, begun and ended at the place I write from. He preached us an excellent sermon on Sunday evening next before his death on the Wednesday fol- lowing. It was remarkable he should have taken as his text, Heb. ch. 9., v. 27, ' It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.' He little thought when he said we might never meet again in this life, he would so soon realize his own words." The other, Mr. Bodenham.I had known almost from his childhood ; and can bear testimony to the purity and zeal which uniformly marked his character and conduct. He wanted nothing but the advantage of longer training and of a higher class of education than could here be afforded him, to have become a still more effec- tive, and I may say, perhaps an eminent la- bourer in the cause of Christ. He had in him the elements of such a character ; firm faith, clearness of discernment ond inflexible integrity of purpose. I have known no young man who, exposed as Mr. Bodenham must have been, and I believe was, to many mis- leading influences, maintained more strictly and affectionately his allegiance to the holy apostolical Church of England, as he rejoiced in calling it ; or who more assiduously, and with a more single heart, endeavoured to fulfil the duties of the ministry, to which his Lord had thought him worthy to be called. I am, Sirs, Your faithful servant, W. G. SYDNEY. His Honor the CIIIEV JUSTICE rose to more the first resolution, and it was the ordinary re- solution, to the following effect :-" That the letter of the ltight Reverend the President, to- gether with the Report now read, and the nudited aeeount of the Committee for 1851, be printed and circulated amongst the members and friends of the Society." The resolution was not one which he ima- gined could excite any discussion, and for himself, feeling his inability to deal with the general objects of the society, he should be better pleased to leave to others the task of addressing this meeting. But he felt he could not acquit himself to his conscience of having performed his duty unless he said a few words to explain his opinion in reference to this great Institution. There was a difficulty, a great difficulty in commencing any observations on the subject. The crowd of ideas which the report and the letter of the Lord Bishop were calculated to excite, rushed too forcibly in the mind to be expressed in well selected words and well arranged sentences. But in the ob- servations he wished to address to this meet- ing, he would first advert to what seemed to him the leading feature of the report-the want of support the Society had had from the laity of the Church of England. There were doubtless in the reports they had heard read, many records of the usefulness of the Society, even with its small means, but on speaking in reference to this report before a meeting of the members of the Church of Eng- land in Sydney, he must say he saw no one topic of congratulation in that report, save and except, the liberal, the generous support which had been given to the Society by two noble institutions of England, with whom this So- ciety was happily connected. Apart from this, what support had the Society received ? It might be from the rush to the gold diegings, by the impulses excited in the hearts of the people by the announcement of the gold dis- covery, a disturbance of mind had been pro- duced which had upset that moral and reli- gious responsibility which ought to exist in ¡ every man s breast The excitement, the en- > thusiasm, even the suffering which had been I caused by the development of one of the sources of colonial wealth, form a sufficient | reason in a worldly point of view why no other idea should take permanent and lasting possession of the public mind But notwith btondtng this, making every allowance that I could be made for the gold discovery and its consequence, it did appear to him great cause of regret that they had not in the hour of its utmost need done their best to support the cause of religion and the Church He took it Miat the Church of England members could only read their self condemnation in the fact that the report of the Society announced they had only subscribed in the last year £116 to it He believed the richest men in the community might be numbered among the members of the Church of England, and yet with its numerical ascendancy, its influence, its power, and its wealth, this £.110 was all that had been contributed to this Society And for what had it been contributed to this Society » For extending the knowledge of the word of God, for promo- ting the ordinances of religion, for diffusing the precepts of morality and -virtue over this great diocese To take these umehoroting in fluences into tracts where they nev or before found a habitation-where over vast districts it was found no spiritual aid had f-und its way It was to extend education, to extend religion, that this society was formed It vv as to reclaim fiom vice the thousands who were growing up without the knowledge of the goodness of the saving help of virtue It was to save human beings, men and children, who had now little apprehension of the crime they committed, from the gaol-from the scaffold-from the Benev olent Asylum - from the madhouie With all these great objects what did they find to be the case-they saw before them a small handful of people assembled, and £11G sub scribed in one vear throughout the entire diocese He asked them to seriously consider this fact Ihey were, as was stated m the report, in con nection with two English societies-the So- ciety for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foieign Parts They had heard of the libe ral support which those societies hid made to this one in New South Wales, and could they hear of this support without a blush 5 When the Jubilee Meeting of the latter society was held in London how strangely did the recog mtionof that event contrast with that which was exhibited m this colony It had been their joint honour, with the Churchmen of the mother country to celebrate the jubilee. At the nueting m London, they found the consort of hei beloved Majesty the Queen - the Prime Minister of England-one of Her Ma j esty s Principal Secretaries of State-a duke, and a large number of other noolemen Was it creditable, then, to Churchmen in New South Wale«, to find this society in the posi- tion m which it was at present placed ' What was thi reason that they did not, like their Lnghsh brethren, receive the sun pott of the higher classes5 Tint influence, and power, and wealth kept aloof from the promotion of that religion which was essential to their own preservation \\\ as it differences that prov nled in matters of form and matters of doctrine5 Ile would humbly nsk thoäc who put forward this ex- cuse, whether it really aflorded any valid plei for the separation of members from'thc Church, and then to ask them this, it any such valid plei were afforded, why not separate from the Church at once 5 If the Church were worth) of support, on minor differences should prevent them from attending to its support, and this Society was designed to be, and ought to be, one of the bulwarks ofthat Church It was true that it might be the opinion of m my that meetings of this kind could do but little good, that per- sons of influence by attending or taking part in the proceedings of such meetings ns the present could but little forward the cause of religion Ile waB not of this opinion , he believed that it was necessary when called on to do so, that tiley should assemble, should rally round their Uishop and their clergy, and assure thom of their confidence m them Ile believed also that they ought to attend these meetings, be- cause if those who took a leading part in pub- lic affairs generally, did not join in the pro motion of religious objects, it munt become matter of observation, and religion must grow into disrepute Now what was the position of Churchmen in this colony5 The Society in London sent them sums, in the spending of which the givers of those sums had no voice, m the expenditure of which they had person- ally no concern They had never seen this colony, had no connection with it, but they had subscribed simply because they had heard of the spiritual destitution which reigned in the land, and in the love of Ood, in the love of that Church in whioh they had been taught to serve Him, their money for His honor and glory flowed here. Should these Societies cease to send their contributions, how would the ranks of the clergy be thinned here. How would the the ordinances of religion be degraded and re- stricted. How many hundreds who now pined for spiritual instruction would be left destitute. It appeared to-him, looking at the whole frame- work of society, that people would begin at the wrong end, that they would rather strive to divert the course of a swollen river, than dam up the sources of that impetuous current. To speak plainly, that they would rather pro- test against crime-they would rather seo the misery that crime created, with all its ex- penses of gaols and benevolent asylums, pene tcntiarics, and madhouses, than they would check that crime in its bud. He might not have been fully intelligible in his observations on this view of the question. But what he wished to say was, that irreligion was not only the cause of crime, but of (in a great degree) distress also. That religious education and instruction provide not only for ( or promoted) spiritual, but moral and material interests ; that, in short, as a general rule, in proportion as men were led by religion to abstain from vice and crime, they also became prudent and frugal, and so rendered benevolent asylums and gaols unnecessary. How was it possible to calculate the omount of misery, the amount of crime, the amount of destitution, which might arise from the want of spiritual instruc- tion in one single instance. Through the want of education and spiritual instruction, it might be that one man fivo-and-twenty years ago fell into crime. That he married, and had chil- dren, and under the example he set them, his children also, and his grand children, it might be, had entered into the same course of crime and misery Now the object of this Society was to reclaim every one It w as to prov ide for the spiritual, and he would add the mate rial interests of society It vv ent not to ensure the punishment of crime, but to prev ent crime, and pievention, fir better by instruction than by punishment w ould be the means of pro tecting the social interests of the rommunitv The Venerable Archdeacon Cow i EU in seconding the adoption of the report, and the printing of the evcellent letter of his Lordship the Bishop, could only say in the words of his Honor the Chief Tustice who had proceeded lum, that the ideas to which those documents had given hirth, were so numerous, that it was difficult to find any point at which to com monee He could not howcvei, second tho resolution without making n few observations relative to it lliey learned from the report that there were miiny things wanting for the promotion of the interests of the Church lhat they wanted churches, they wanted clergy, they vv anted books All these thing« were wanted, and would the Church of Eng land sit by and sec these w ants unsupphed And what he would ask vv is the cause of all this indifference to the cause of religion He believed the cause tobo, and he regretted to see it, th it there was really a deficiency ofthat high Christian feeling which the Bib'e ireuica ed, and which they, as Churchmen, were bound to exercise It was distressing to be ouliged to say so but there w ero people m the upper nnd middle classes of s>cicty who might do moie for their religion than they did at present Thev were willing enough to spend their pouiiüs to promote the naities and frivolities of the world but thev refused to come forward to support that Church to w Inch they belonged, in all its formularies all its requirements, with their properties, with their souls and with their bodies, as they as Christians were bound to do A melancholy account had been furnished to them in his Lordship s letter, of the spiritual destitution exist ling in tho interior (Hie venerable gen l tleman here entered into some description I of the want of religious instruction in ¡he interior ) But what could they do, to stop | this plague, to remove the grievous stain from them Let evciy man consider whether ho may not reduce his establishments -whether he may not lefruin from costly garments, and I cast up ev cry Sabbath morning what from such sacrifices, he eoukl afforl to (,ive to the cause of Christ (Lhc I Venerable Archdeacon proceeded to nan ate the good effects of such a cours in the. case of one gentleman who had put by one tenth of his worldly income for religious pui poses ) If the members of the Church would follow this example, then the ordinances of religion might be laithfully upheld in this colony I He would tell them that without the desire to I keep up these ordinances, no nation no kui' dom, no individual no authority, could pros per Without religion a nati in was n3 a ship I without an aneh >r lhey might issue licenses to dig gold-they might issue licenses to de p isture sheep but if thej did this as they pro iisscd to do if for the good of society part of the money they received from those licensee ought to go to the religious instruction of the people lhen the question arose, wh it should be the education that should be imparted to the rising generation Some there were who sitd th it education should be wholly secular-but he did not believe this was the cdueition that I could train a nation a nation destined ' to Christian influences and Christian civilization Ile li id known persons to be able to read, vvritc, nnd cast accounts, but upon whose hearts and minds the finger of God had left no lmpuss It was not this sort of education that » is destined to m ike thom worthy to be a nation There must be spirit ual impressions made in the mind of every individual of every family, of every commu nity Depiit from this rule and they would grow into a mero commarcial community Ihe gold or the fleece m L,ht soreid its attractions, but thev would find in the long run that a nation to be great must have re igioi s înstruc tion and relicious habits Ihe secular educa tion offered by some was not sufficient Hie children must attend their Sabbath schools, they must be taught precept hy precept, line on line, by the solemn iddrcs«cs of their clergy, to become Christians, and to act up to Christian rule and practice He was aw ire that schools had been erected and books written for the purpose of this secular education But though it was pro- fessed that all that was moral and good was taught in these schools, and in tluse books, he should prove by quotation from the latter that they were perfectly infidel It was true they might contain some moral lessons, that they might be written with great poetic fervour, and f,reat skill and taste, yet the principles on which they vveic based were infidel principles He held in his hand an extract from one of these books, which had seemed to be so ev mgelieal, so devotional, so moral, and so reasonable, that it had passed through four editions in one year And yet the passage he found m it, though it had not the prof inencss and blasphemous infidelity of lorn Paine s or Carlisle s writings, hau had the same infidel tendency , and it was the attrac- tive style in which the work was written which rendered it the more dangerous But it needed not argument to prove that it was not secular education that could train the human mind to its highest duties It was the serious thoughts which religion instilled, the instruction of the Bible, and the power ot prayer, which could alone redeem the human family from its fallen condition,and the schools which were now the fusluon would not give this training Were thiv, then, to bo surrounded with schools which, iffording no rclinious instruction, with- drew many from those Sabbath schools where their attendance was formerly required Hit venerable gentuman here at some length ad- verted to tilt evil arising from the schools of the National System of Education not requir- ing any account from the pupils of their li tvmg attended Sabb ah sell íols o i the Sundays In conclusion, he would ask tin in to look at their own position Here in Sydney thev hud the advantage of religious obstrvunces, three times every Sabbath diy Ihey were, in fact, in the midst of all the blessings that could bo showered upon them But should not this in- duce them the moro to make provision for those who were in the country. Gild, he hesitated not to say, h id alrcauy boen a great evil to this country It liad been no blessing It had takoti from their communion w ith tho ordinances of God its thousands, ¡in 1 what had it effected in return J If that gold, or tlmt portion of that / old which ought to be cons-crated to the service of God had been consecrated to him, then in- deed it would have been well But how much out of the pockets of private diggers had been given to religious objects' How much he asked w ent to the Queen from this discovery ' And did the Crown give out of ita share that portion which ought to be bestowed to spiritual matters, and without which no felicity, no greatness, no real glory, could wait on an earthly throne He dared not detain them longer, but commended the report to their most serious consideration It instructed them in how much there was lo be done, and how little had been done and then, when they looked around them, and felt how much they had to be thtnkful for, that they were blessed almost beyond all other people, they could hardly como to any other conclusion than that they were not so holy, so self denying, so earnest in the cause of religion, OB those in the old land far away The resolu- tion was then put and passed Mr T W CA I E hero rose to suggest, that in consideration of the lateness of the hour, the meeting sho ile! postpone the rcm uning busi- ness to another opportunity Ile was induced to suggest this course, in the hope that a more efficient plan of proceeding might be dev ised than that whicn was at present followed, and winch he regretted deeply to lind had produced so little result as yet He thought it behoved laymen especially to take the matter to heart, and evert themselves to aid the Church out of her present unsatisfactory position Ironi being the leading religious body in the colony, sho had filien into a condition, which he, as a faithful member of that Church most deeply deploi ed He felt some hope, howcv er that if the course he proposed vv ero adopted, the Committee might meet again on a future occasion w ith greater effect anti more satisfac- tory prospects Mr Cape then proceeded to express his respectful dissent from some of the observations vvluehhad fallen from the Venera- ble Archdeacon Cow pei on the subject of the nation ii svs em of education, which ho felt were too sweeping and to a great extent unde- served He did not believe that the system would be tolerated for a moment, if it were really so bad and so d ingcrous as had been lepresented The Pin sim NT concurred g neially in tho suggestions of Mr Gape, but as chairman of the meeting, he thought the more regular course vv ould be to put the i csolution, w hich had been moved and seconded, before Mr Cape s suggestio is w ore taken into considera- tion The first resolution having accordingly boen put, was carried unanimously His Loiinsmi then said he fully concurred in the proposal for an adjournment of the meeting, notwithstanding that the meeting itself was an adjourned meeting It was clear that a more nniin itcd spirit was wanting, with- out whieh it vvns impossible that the end they proposed to themselves could be at- tained, namely, that of preaching the gospel tliroughout the length and breadth of the land Ho felt deeply obliged to his venerable friend for the truly Christian, and he might add, philosophic speech he had just delivered , and he must confess he entirely agreed with his venerable friend in the severe censure he had passed tic mist that system of education which excluded religious instruction, and which he felt con» meed could only end in the establishment of wide spread infidelity Ile could not but feel gi cat i egret mid deep appiehension at tho prospect which he saw before lum The na- tional sv stem he could onlv characterise as a crown of thorns on the head of Christ But if thov really had it nt luait to promote the glory of then divine Redeemer, and diffuse the bless- ing of the Gospel, they must combino and work together 1 ir more"willin0ly than they had yet done llieie was some little misap | prehension a« to the amount of contributions made in fin tim mee of the obiects of the Church, which he w as dcoirous ot correcting It was true this Socictv had only received the sum of LI IO during the past year, a sum so small tint he could hardly mention it without blushing, mo e c-pccially, when he stated that considerably more than half that sum was con- tributed by only S"ven individu ils But there was a bri"htei side ot the picture, and that vv is the f ict that dilling the past year LGSjJ and some shillings had been contributed hy the peopli of New South I Wales toward« the aid of the Church both ni the colony and in the mother eountiy, at the collections mide on the oce isi n of the jubilee which had already been ref rred o He therefore thought theio was no reason to despair, and if he could see a little more earnestness, a more devoted spirit, a greiter sense of their deep obligation to God, he was convinced a great deal ino e might be clone and he might be spaied the pam and mortilication of again travelling ovei hundreds, he might say thou- sands, of miles, and witnessing the lamentable spuitual destitution which he had seen on his late visit ition Ile regictted th it Churchmen here did not feel a3 then brother Churchmen did in England Without lefercnco to the money which had been given foi tlio completion of St Andrew s Cathedril, nor to the 1 ict that he had boen relieved of the heavy debts which he had been compelled to incur in reference to it, and for which lelief he felt most thankful, he would inst Btato that ho had now m his possession the sum of £1000, which had been « nt to linn by a single indi- vidual in En¿le.nd, towards tho erection of a school on an cvtcnsivc scale , but ho did not know how to apply the m moy, finding as he did no corresponding liber thty in the colony, w Inch might enable him to e irry out the bene- volent intentions of the giver He had also another offer of X. 1000 from a fiicnd of fifty wears'standing to be api ted to the endow- ment of a chinch in this city, on condition that an equal sum should be raised in the colony fjr the same object He mentioned these facts to shov the spuit that animated then brethren ni longland, and he coul only expr BS his hearty w ish and hope that the Churchmen m this colony woul 1 take example from thom, and go and t' ) likewise He would conclude by suggesting the adjournment of the meeting Ho thought an appeal should be made, by the Committee, to all laymen to co- oper ito with the Ministers of the Church, and if such co operation were iffoided m a right spirit, there was notlun/ which they tould not accomplish togethei He would happily and readily concur in any plan that might be sug- gested lor rendering the operations of the So- ciety more efficient, and he was suie he might promise thom also the co operition of his
