TUESDAY, MARCH X1, 1879. The nervous anxiety exhibited in various quarters with regard to the speedy floating of tho loan is very significant. It is a tacit admission that certain political and financial sins have found us out. To every one engaged in commercial affairs, the im- mediate inflation of the currency by means of borrowed funds is evidently the paramount question of the day. Our banking and other institutions which deal in money, find their opera- tions limited and their discretion controlled by the scarcity of the circu- lating medium, traders bewail the want of accommodation just at the time it is particularly needed, and property owners see their belongings falling in value daily. The labouring classes suffer sympathetically, as is always the case when a tightness in the money market curtails ordinary business and puts a stop to enterprise. They, too, are doubtless watching the approaching financial experiment with somewhat strained attention. As to what has led to the existing dearth opinions differ. But that it exists to an unparalleled extent cannot be doubted. Wo do not remember anything like the con- cern which is now manifested being ever exhibited in connexion with the realisation of any former loan, and this fact is all the moro remarkable because the relief in prospect is comparatively insignificant in amount. As we stated yesterday, the Government will not in all probability place more to its credit in the colony out of the first ¿£3,000,000 than .£1,500,000. This, with the £400,000 advanced by the banks (which will be set free by the pending operation) will give our monetary agencies the command of £1,900,000 more than they possess at present. But over three-fourths of this will speedily be absorbed in the works for which it was borrowed, and when once the money shall have been paid away by the Go- vernment-ceased to be a Government deposit-it is impossible to say what proportion will find its way back to the coffers of the banks, and be available to meet the ordinary trade demands which cannot now be satisfied, owing to the withdrawal of capital from the colony, and the diversion of much that remains from legitimate banking transactions to the business of advancing on land. Land is an admirable security as a rule, but, as many of our financiers are finding out at present, it is not readily con- vertible, especially at those times when mortgagors in a body would like to turn their re pective interests into cash. In a recent issue, we published an interesting letter from Mr. ANDREW LYELL, in which that gentleman endea- vours to elucidate our financial position by reference to statistics furnished by1 the banks according to law, and also to indicate the cause of our present diB tress Tor full particuhrs wo must itfci oui readers to the communication itself, mci ely noticing lieio the geneial íesults in ned

elsewhere-taken awaj bj men on the spot and able theiefore to appieciate the tendency of affaira-by an ill consideied land tax and a general feeling of insecurity This diain, we imagine, has beeu

partly through natural causes peculiar to the colonies, and partly through the com mercial depiession which has been gene ral foi some time thioughout tho woild But it cannot be denied that political mismanagement and self seeking have done at least as much to impair otu position as eithei of tho agencies alluded to No statesman, of couroe, would have chosen such a time as the pieseut to make wai
