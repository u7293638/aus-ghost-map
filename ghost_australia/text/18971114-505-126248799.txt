PRINCE ALFRED YACHT CLUB RACE. I Cruising about just prior to starting Isea looked to great advantage under a nicely-setting iuck yavd topsail, while her chief rival, Jess, with tho wiud light, and under a very limited square header, did not appear to bo very dangerous, and as events turaed out she didn't prove so either. Sapphire (lute Harpy) had a beautifully-setting Buit of suils, but the old bout apparently had no extras to set during the raco wheu with tlie wind free, and was consequently severely handicapped. Isea gave a fine exhibition of light - weather racing, showing a clean pair of heels right through out the race. Herreshoil made a big eliort to keep pace with her duriuj the early portion of the race, but Mr. Cox's o-rater hadn't a ghost of a show under her small sail plan. lone sailed very indiffe rently, and finally gave up, while both Labloo and Bronzewiug chased their bigger rivals round the course in very game fashion. The particulars of the racing are as follow : — Isea, W. W. Marks, 7min SOsecs ? ? 1 Sapphire, H. A. Jones, 23min ? ? 2 Hekbl'SUOITC, Jas. Cox, ISmin 20seo ? 3 Other starters: Jess, A. A. Griffiths, scratch; lone, J. O. O'Urieu, 27min ; Lahloo, W. H. Mur rell, 'J'Jmiii 30sec; Bronzewiug III., S. Hordern, jun., S7min. The course was from a Hue between the starter's bont and H.M.S. Orlando's buoy, round the cluh buoy at Manly, Shark Island, aud Fort Deuison, thence round the Pile Light in Watson's Bay, Shark Island, and back to a liuish at the starter's boat. The starting times were : Sapphire 2li 35m 10s, Isea 2h U5m lis, Bronzewiug 2h 13s, Labloo aud Herreshoif2h 35m 25s, lone 2h 35m '48s, and Jess 2h 35m 60s. All were sent away to an excellent start, the times of getting away being : Sapphire -h 3om lOsec, Isea 21i '85m 12s, Bronzewing 'h 35m 13s, Herreshoff and Lahloo 2h35m2S lone Uh 35m 48s, aud Jess 2m 35m 50s. With the exception of Isea and Ioue all stood awny on the starboard taclc, aud worked down to Bradley's Head with the tide a-lee. Isea at once opened out a lead, and at Bradley's was a good 2min ahead of Jess and Herreshoff, both of which were sailing neck and neck. Isea's skipper judged the distance nicely for clearing the headland, while Herreshoff. on the contrary, made a lontr board on the port tack before throwing round, which lost her some ground, as she had more room than she required to clear the point. Both she aud Jess wero tbe second yachts to ease sheets for the long lend down to Manly, the order of the others being: — Lahloo, Sapphire, Bronzewing. and lone. The threo leading boats at ones set jib-topsails, while Sap phire sent a jackyarder aloft, and Lahloo nnd lone added extras. Jess gradually drew away from Herreshoff, while the leader gained upwards of half a minute . from Jess, and Sapphire over hauled Lahloo. The times rounding tlio buoy at Manly were: Isea 3h 29m 30a, Jess 3h Slin 59s, Herreshoff 3h 33m, Sapphire 31i 35m 41s, Lahloo 3b 37m, Bronzewing 3U 4Um 29s, Ioue3h4!m 33s. It was a close fetch to Shark Island, and the lot carried jib-topsails round the buoy. Isea con tinued to widen the gap from the others, while Herreshoff held Jess in fine style. Rounding Shark Island they were timed as follows: Isea-lh 6m 42s, Jess 4h llin 8s, Herreshoff 4h 12m 15s, Sapphire 4h 17m 3s, Lahloo 4h 21m 39s, Ioue 4h 24m 10s, Bronzewiug 4h 2Gm 20s. For the dead run to Fort-Deuison spinnakers were set on Isea, Jess, and Herreshoff. while Lahloo carried a balloon jib square, and Bronzewing also set a small kite, but neither Sapphire nor Ioue troubled about any extras. Isea made.great pace on tho ruu up tho harbor, and Herreshoff overhauled Jess, the times flatteuing-iu for the beat to the Watson's Bay Pilelighfc beiug : Isea 4h 26miu 23s, Herreshoff 4h 32m 28s, Jess 4h 32m 45s, Sapphire 4h 38m, Ioue 4h 49m 5s.' Lahloo, and Bronzewing wero not timed. Jess soon caught and passed Herreshoff ou the work down, but failed to get any closer to the leader, which rounded the I'ilclight (imin SSseo ahead of Jess, Herreshoff at this point, being about a minute behind the latter. The times at Shark Island were : Isea 5u 20m .iaaeo, Jess 5u 2Um 2s, Herreshoil 5h Sim 32s, Sapphire 51i 41m 3s, Lahloo ah 52m 36s. Spinnakers were again run aloft for the final turn, and Isen stiil further increasod her lead from Jess, while Herreshoff was almost able to hold the latter, tho finishing times being : Isea 5h 3Sm 55s, Jess 5h 50m 18s, Herreshoff 5h 52m 59s, Sapphire Gh lilt 35s, Lahloo 6h 15m 46s, and Bronzewing till 24m 5s. 'Jiherefore, after deducting tiae allowances, Isea won by tlie big margin of 7miu l'Jseo from Sapphire, which beat Herreshoff for second place by lmin 4Bec. The cluh steamer, in charge of Mr. J. H. Harris, followed the race throughout.
