The Ghost of a Protectorate. Figaro recently showed how shadowy was Lord Derby's Protectorate proposal. We were informed by cablegram that the British Protectorate was to be over a part of the shores of New Guinea. I immediately wanted to know what a shore was, and pointed out it could only be a fringe-line—a thing having length and no breadth ! The farce of stick ing the British Flag in the mud, and of giving a waddy to a red-flannel-shirted nigger has been gone through. And Figaro's criticism has been proved to be warranted. What has Commodore Erskine proclaimed a British Beadledom over ? As Sir Thos. M'H wraith has said in the House, the Protectorate—such as it is !—is established over a line meandering' in a continual easterly direction from the 141st meridian. Sir Thomas naturally asks, How can a single crooked line constantly going in one direction enclose any area r It is absurd. It is foolery. Lord Derby must think Australian colonists are as uninformed as the New Gruinea natives, or are as great chuckle heads as he is himself. Talk about the Chinese firing off crackers and fancying they're doing bloody slaughter in battle. Here is Great Britain—the foremost nation in the world—banging away empty cannon, and parading a lot of uniformed warriors before a dirty lot of niggers and a missionary, and fancying she is playing at a Protectorate !
