SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. SPORTING NOTES.' His Excellency the Governor has signified his intention of being present at the Caulfield races to-day. Titan, Vere, Question, Linburn, nndDondi, engaged at to-day's Caulfield races, arrived from Ballarat yesterday. Racing will take place at Rosehill to-day. The Derby colt Trenchant will probably be a starter in the October Handicap, which is run over a mile and a quarter and 100 yards. The following scratchings for the V.A.T.C. Spring Meeting were recorded yesterday All Knga-gemonts-Toorootiga and Cobalt, Caul- field Stakes-JC. Steeplechase-Riverton. DcuutantStakos-Reconstruction, Bell Metal. Gang Awa', Larpcdon. Toorak Handicap Jevveller, 15, E.K., Maree, and Melodian. Caulfield Guineas Sylvan Prince, The Gardener,Téméraire, Princess Olga, Vestatiu, Lexicon, and Elton. Moscow gave a further taste of his quality at Epsom yesterday, when he won the Mor- dialloc Handicap, one mile and three furlongs, in a common canter, and his chance in the Caulfield Cup with 6st. 7lb. is now considered by many a first-class one. Dona- tion was given another public trial for the Caulfield Cup in yesterday s race, but Moscow beat him like a hack, Donation, as at Maribyrnong, running very unkindly). Steinhauser B absence from the tracks is caused by something more serious than was at first suspected. TL'm feet are said to be the seat of the trouble. The son of Musket, who was backed on Wednesday evening for the Melbourne Cup, 1 is now at a long price for the two miles race. 15, who strained himself on Thursday, is also in a bad way. Mr. J. C. O'Donnell has latterly gained some celebrity as an amateur rider, several races being won by him in rather good style. His reputation as a horseman, however, received a blow yesterday as a result of his riding of Epping in the Hunters' Steeplechase Epsom. There were only four starters in the race, and a shade of odds and even money were laid on Epping, whose rider took matters so easily until the last half mile that Epping had not the ghost of a chance of winning. The gelding has plenty of pace, but when it came to giving Name- sake and Banker nearly a furlong start in the last half mile, Epping, as might be expected, was quite unequal to the task of catching them. He finished a bad last. The trophy presented by the proprietary of the Richmond racecourse to Mr. F. Robbins on account of his mare M) story breaking Crain, over two miles in the trotting match against Osterley, on Wednesday last, will be on view at Mr. Robbins's residence, 47 Bay street, this evening. The card of the Caulfield Cup and Derby will be read over at the Victorian Club at half-past 8 o'clock this evening. At the Victorian Club last night the card of the Caulfield Guineas was read over, but as there was so much doubt as to what would start no market could be made, and there was no attempt to do business. Surely in connection with an important event like the Caulfield Guineas the V.A.T.C. executive should fix the time of acceptance a day or two before the race, instead of at scale us a present. Carnage and Repudiation are to arrive from St. Albans this morning. Cobalt has been withdrawn from the V.R.C. Yan Yean Stakes. Ladas, winner of the Middle-park Plate, is following in the footsteps of Isinglass, who won the race last year. Isinglass had not previously been beaten, and neither has aces, whose previous victories were in the Epsom Woodcote Stakes, the Ascot Coventry Stakes, and the Doncaster Champagne Stakes. Ladas is pretty certain to be the winter favourite for the Derby, and it remains to be seen whether he can equal the three year-old record of Isinglass. Illuminate, the dam of Ladas, is by Rosicrucian from Purnim, by Blair Athol. Owners and trainers are reminded that entries for the opening meeting on the Ascot course close on Monday. The six events over £300 in stakes, and the races are well arranged, comprising a Hurdle Race, for horses ; a Time Handicap Trot, for horses the Ascot Cup, of £100 ; Steeplechase, of two miles ; a Disposal Stakes, and a Galloway Handicap. The trophy for the Ascot Cup is on view at the Royal Mail Hotel, Bourke and Swanston streets. Nominations will close on Monday for the Oaklands Hunt Club, Moonee Valley, and Ballarat Miners' Turf Club meetings. THE BETTING MARKET. There was a good muster of members at the Victorian Club last night, when the card of the Caulfield Cup and V.R.C. Derby was read over. Division remained a firm favourite for the V.A.T.C. event ; 100 to 14 was laid against him two or three times, but he could not be backed for big money at a longer price than 100 to 12. Brookleigh met with slight support at 100 to 7, which price was after wards wanted. A wager of 1,000 to 80 was booked about Jeweller, and Moss Rose's name was written to the extent of £1,500 at 100 to 2. Port Admiral was supported for a few hundreds at 100 to 2. Fulham was easier, but when 500 to 15 was offered against the South Australian it was quickly taken. About Hartington wagers of 500 to 40 and COO to 12 were recorded, his closing price being 100 to 3. Tim Swiveller was the medium of a little speculation. 1,000 to 20 and 500 to 12 being accepted about the Grand Nationafllutdle Race winner. Moscow was much firmer, and after being backed to win £1,000 at 100 to 6, 100 to 7 was the best figure on offer against him. Later on in the evening Oxide was backed to win £2,500 at 100 to G. There was no business on the Derby. The following were the closing prices on offer : CAULFIELD CUP "~_j (Run Saturday, Oct. 21). 100 to 12 Division (100 to 11 tk) ü Brockleigh (100 to 7 to) 6 Jeweller (tk and off) 7 Moscow (100 to 6. tk) 6 Oxide (tk and off) 4 Wild Rose 4 Donizetti 4 Newton 4 Fulham (100 to 3 to) 4 All Thora 3 Fortunareis i 8 Donation 5 Hartington (100 to 25 tk) V.¿-.',DE_-Y , (Run Saturday, Nov. 4). 100 100 to a Tarcoola S Moss Rose (100 to 2 at) 8 l'ortAdnilral(lUOto.tk) 3 Pappin S Steadfast ." 3 Newman a Vakeel. 3 Tim Swiveller (100 to 30 tk) .

SYDNEY, FRIDAY.' Betting was dull to-day, the only business being Jeweller 100 to 9 offered, and Moscow 100 to 5 offered, for the Caulfield Cup, VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. FIRST (GUINEAS) DAY. The spring racing carnival will be fairly inaugurated to-day, when the Victoria Amateur Turf Club Meeting will be commenced. The course is in splendid order, there is a promise of excellent sport, the usual complete arrangements have been made, and fine weather is only required to assure the success of the gathering. The upset of form at the A.J.C. Spring Meeting, so for from discouraging backers, has rather whetted their appetites for speculation, and the racing is being looked forward to with more than ordinary interest. Two at least of the events-the Caulfield Stakes and Guineas may be expected to throw considerable light on the three big races Caul- field Cup, Derby, and Melbourne Cup, to be run later on in the season. The running in the Caulfield Stakes, however, it may be as well to remind backers, as not always a reliable guide. Thus last year Paris was badly beaten in that race, yet on the following Saturday he won the Caulfield Cup in a canter. The experience in regard to Hoz in 1880 and Vengeance in 1891 was exactly similar. The quality of the field this year promises to be exceptionally good. Mr. John Crozier will probably start both Fulham and Vakeel. Portsea, Division. Marche, Camoola, Sword bearer, Brookleigh, Fortunatus, and Jeweller, who are all a good deal fancied for one or other of the cups are engaged, as well as one or two smart three-year-olds. The Guineas will be of unusual importance, owing to the three-year-old form being in such a Topsy Turvey state. The race should throw a good deal of light on the V.R.C. Derby, and the winner will probably he installed favourite for that event. The two-year-old event, the Debutant Stakes, will take a deal of picking. The field promises to be large, and several of the youngsters will be well backed. Brockleigh is top weight in the Toorak Handicap, but he may be started in the Caulfield Stakes in preference to this event, in which some good performers in Wild Rose, Linburn, Tarcoola, and Beverley were engaged. Two jumping events, the Hurdle Race and First Steeplechase, fill up the card. The full programme is appended a-?

CRICKET, THE PENNANT MATCHES. The first round of matches for the senior cricket pennant commences this afternoon, though at the time of writing there seems very little probability of any cricket being played. Even should play be possible the bowlers are likely to have much the best of it,' and, anxious as teams are to get their opponents in on the first Saturday of the season, however good the wicket, Unit anxiety will be doubled as matters now stand. The match of chief interest is that between East Melbourne and Melbourne on the E.M.C.C. ground. The East are, it is considered, a greatly improved eleven this year, while Melbourne would, it was thought, be rather weak in the earlier games of the season, "flint apparent weakness, however, appears to be rapidly passing away, the two names in their eleven for to-day that will excite most interest being those of Haddrick and J. W. Trumble. The former was in turn considered a certainty by both Richmond and East Melbourne, and has finally Bettleddoivn With Melbourne. North and South Melbourne meet at South Melbourne, and Carl- ton has its first trial in the first division against Fitzroy at Carlton, but suffers a serious loss in A. Carlton, who bowled so well for them last year. The best match in the B division is that between Richmond and the University, who pinyon the University ground.
