I HAUNTED. > One'day, alas, Host my youth, I I know not when or How ; / I only know I had > it once, _ And cannot find it now. . But sometimes in the winter I feel it in th8 air, And when the snowflakos kiss my facs - It seems to touch me there. Then in the spring the breezes That wander from the South, With warm caresses laden. Seek youth upon my mouth. And, oh, the summer sunbeams That make the roses blnsh— . . v They stir my blood and linger To bid my wan cheeks flash.' My youth? I lost it long ago, Bat of this faofc I boast — It may be dead, but, surely, I Am haunted by its ghost. . — EdwAbd Yah Zilb.
