Singular Superstition. LAYING A GHOST. A New Haven despatch to a New York paper says:â€” In the Soman Catholic Ceme tery in Birmingham early on the morning of the 18th nit. four middle-aged women and two men, the latter armed with spades and jiom, uweiwx oy me uae-gate ana nutea in front of a newly-made grave. The men set to work, while the women wept, and opened the grave and hauled a coffin np. The lid was taken off and the remains of a beautiful yonng girl were revealed. She waa the daughter of one of the women, and the mother shrieked loudly when ahe saw the corpse. Tfce men stood aside and the four women bent over the coffin, and deft fingers went rapidly throngh the dead girl's hair and abroad, and all the pins that conld be found on the remains were removed. Then a needle and -thread were procured, and the shroud and hair sewn back into their places. The lid was then screwed back' on the coffin, and the remains were again lowered into the grave, which was at once filled np. It was learned that the women were of a very super stitious nature, and they believed that If a corpse ia buried with the shroud pinned np instead of se*ed, the soul will be confined to the grave for eternity, and the persons guilty of the mistake will be haunted until death by the ghost of the victim. A mistake was made in tbia case, and one at the women claims that she has seen the ghost for two or three nights snecessf ally, and she could stand it no longer ; ao she got the other women together, and between them they hired the men to disinter the body. The ghost has not been seen since.
