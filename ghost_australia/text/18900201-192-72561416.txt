CHAPTBB H. ASDQSW SBCEIYE8 AJTOTHKB SHOCK. If Andrew had prolonged Jus keyhole in vestigations a second longer his perturbed spirit woul&;have been set at rest on one score at least. He would have discovered the wbsreabtiuts of ihg young woman over whose advent he had worked himself up into a perfect fever of anxiety. With b yawn and ian audible exclamation of dismay, MissDorsey sat bolt upright on the divan behind the portiere, refreshed but slightly bewildered, . It: required several ap plications i)f fc^r knuobles to har _ eyes to arouse her thoroughly, by whioh time she began to feel afresh , the gnawing pangs of hunger, together with a growing sense of indignation at Andrew's remarkable conduct. She felt sure that the stupidest darkey on her far-away plantation' home would never have treated a visitor of hers in this manner. She looted quite as cross as it was in her to look when »he finally partedthe portiere and advanced into the room bent upon ringing Andrew up'and spe«ik her mind to him very plainly this time. With the strident deter mination - upon her to assert her claim to more hospitable treatment, she looked about her for a belli-rope.

The master of the house, sitting close by in fais Ubtaiy, plunged in a reverie of the som breithue.neardit and suddenly raised his head lo hear it better. It was a sad, worn face thus brought'ibto full view. The gas had cever beeu tuttied off since he had entered the room'after dinner the night before. He had forgotten it. It combined now with the hot sunshine that streamed through the window whose shade he had not thonght to draw down to bririg|oUt every crease and line on his tired face.' There were plenty of them to bring ont.
