The above advertisement in a London paper was the talienmai which drew us to Sea Vale, a quiet watering place on the Bristol Chanunl. My father, a retired naval ouicer, hated town life; but we had lived in London for the sake of the boys Their educa 11on was now completed, and all beinga well out of hand, there remained no blidmrnce to my father's modest ambi tion.for life in the cetantry, with at bit of fishIng to while away the time. The Knoll was a low, irregularly built house, Ivy clad, and nestling at the foot of a larch- crowned hill, the slopes of which were clothed with Iossy turf, jewelled with sweet wild thyme, pink sea thrift, dainty harebells and-golden trefoil. In front of the house was a large gar den overflowi-' with fruit and flowers growlng with little regard to order, but tirescnting a beautiful whole to loversof old-fslhioned gardnlening. Great bushl t.ses, glowing with masses of bloom, tsweet Will nams inl endless varietsphiks, ilarksp?ts, and quaint-faced pansies grew: side by side with (ruit trees and vegetablej. About a mile beyonil the garden Icy the channel. of which tiler' was au tlnbroken view from every win dlow.

People are ialnays ready to declare a place luttinted that has been the scene of a tuielde or murder." SQuite so," agreed my father. "I am no believer in ghosts, but the fact re mains that mydaughter,a fortnight ago, saw the head and shoulders of an old man, apparently dead; and we all saw the same face last night through the window. On no account shall I remain at The Knoltl unless the affair is cleared up. Will you spend an evening with us? Should the face again appear you will at least be able to tell us if it re sembles the late Mr Marsh?" Willingly the agent acquiesced ; but though he came for a whole week noth ing was seen of the apparition.. That the man thought us little less than idiots we were well aware.. "I thliik, sr," said he one evening when he rose to go, "you will allow that it Is useless my coming out here night after night." " It does seem like it," returned my father. "but come until the end of this week." At this moment IHannah burst into the rooml without ceremony, crying, "Old Marsh! sir, old Marsh!" Quickly we went into the hall, and again were confronted by the cold shadowy form of the dead man. The agent took one glance, and putting up his arms to ward off the dreadful sight. exclaimed in hushed, horrified tones: "It is he, sh it is Mr Marsh!" Expl:lntation there was none. Sleep in th:tt hosne another night not one of us would. late though it was, we walked into Sea Vale and took rooms until such tlime as we could remorveour belongings. The agent refused to again undertake tihe letting of The Knoll. le wrote Mrs Marsh a full account of what he had Iilmself witnessed. The following day brought hint a let ter from Mrs Marsh, who commenced by expressing her thankfulness to have .t last discoveredlthe reason why sIte could not keep a tenant. Having no portrait of her lI1tband she had a cast taken af ter death and a bust executed by a well known sculptor. This bust she felt sure was not a thing strangers would eire to have about. Therefore when she let TheKaiollfurnlshed,itwas placed on the top of the oak cabinet fuacing the dining room door. That it was the reflection of this hust thrown upon the hall win dow she had but little doubt. She re rquested the agent to ask my father to go uilth him to The Knoll and see for hinm self. We went that night in a hl?ly. No thing could'be seen of the bust from the door, tbut Upan ellmbing to the topll of the step ladder there it was, pushed far back atttailst the wall in the hollowed arch of the alcove. We lighted the laInps:nud went into the ball. There, as before, was the face that had so alarmned us and previous tenants. Upon closing the door it, of course, instantly va nished. We are still living at our beautiful cottage, and we often tontgratulate our selves upon the fortnuate discovery of an optIcal illusion, whclh. upon tile re moval of the bust, hlappily freed us from the Iptresence.of " Tile Man at the Vint dow."-'"London Dramatic News."
