Butters, MLC, and Mr Zox, M.L.A., in the reception room Mr Toole was introduced to many old friends and comrades with whom he had been associated on the English stage, and he appeared to be in the best of health and spirits He is rather short in stature, with a strongly humourous face, which is vigorous and capable withal, and he looks much younger than the 58 years led people to expect The chair was occupied by Mr Arthur Garner, Mr Williamson being absent from the colony.

Harwood, Wi bert Reeve Bland Holt and others Among the latter was the following note from Mr J L Purves, Q C - My Dear Corner, - The prevailing epidemic has me by the throat and The Spider could not put on the 'M'Ginnis' more effectually You know how much I looked forward to welcoming the good old actor from 'home' as a representative of young Australia, and how much I should have liked to have differentiates him from the Barry procession of tailor clad women, and dressmaker clad men, posturers barbers' blocks, elocutionists, I know not what, who come demanding a welcome they do not deserve He was a true actor a quarter of a century ago, when I last saw him and when he had to be a leader in the profession to attract notice From what I read, he is still the inimitable 'low comedian he always was, low in lining to my mind, that he naturally dived deep down into the hearts of his audience I read of great folks who have joined in wishing him home-made and God speed In my time he was the joy of humble folks-second row in the pit critics and better judges However, I know you are busy, and perhaps you are beginning to think that La Gi ippe has got 111 my head Perhaps so To see your guests mahar face would have taken me back in one net to the long days ago, when the world was young for me I could almost have fancied myself once again at the Albion for grilled bones and whisky hot, and the ghosts of Robson, Webster Davidson, little Cooke, Tim Moore Byron that fellow Levy, of Lawson, Phelps Thackeray, Dickens, Laurence Oliphant, Albert Smith Lingford, old Windsor, Hogarth, el hoc Selina come, thronging the supper boxes Perhaps, though unable to welcome the coming, I may be privileged to speed the parting guest at some Murn gathering, until when I must wish you to excuse my unfortunate (forms) and inadvertent absence " A Looking round the tables one was reminded by the mingling of old faces with new ones of the successive changes which have marked the growth of the Melbourne State But there was good acting in the old days of canvas tents and wooden shanties as there is now When Mr Coppin, the pioneer of the Victorian drama opened at the Queen's J theatre in 1855 ten years after the landing of John Batman, he had in his company Mrs Charles Young, afterwards Mrs Herman Vezin, and Robert and Charles Young were leading comedians of the period In June, 1851 the manager himself made a successful appearance at the Haymarket, London, as the chief character in " The Mayor of Navarre,' and as Crack lil "The Turnpike Gate, and he afterwards played Starring engagements in the English provinces for a time as "the Australian comedian In later times we have seen in the colony, G V Brooke Barry Sullivan Lambert, Hoskins, Jefferson, Charles Kean, C Mathews, Montgomery, Anderson Ristori, Creswick, Fred Marshall Fred Leslie, and Nellie Farren As regards stage accessories, plays are now produced as well as Melbourne is in London, and the theatres are equal in point of elegance and comfort to those of the great metropolis. But Mr Toole will be a new experience to many He is something more than a mere droll His humour, the natural outcome of a Bunny nature, is of the most inspiriting, type, without being coarse or Vulgar The laughter he raises, as Mr Clement Scott, the critic of the London Datbi 'Iclcyianli, expresses at often ' touches the borderland of tears," and his capacity to sound the pathetic stop has much to do with his great popularity in England When the time came for proposing toasts, the chairman gave the health of "Our dear old friend Toole, ' remarking that a majority of those present must hold his name among their earliest recollections, while they would be pleased to be able to congratulate him upon the wonderful appearance of youth he presented Mr Toole was received with great cheering when he rose to respond He expressed the pleasure he felt in meeting so many old friends in a new land, and said he was looking forward to a long chat with Mr Coppin, one of the finest comedians that ever trod the Australian stage Some 20 or 25 years ago he dined with Sothern, Jefferson, and Coppin 111 Liverpool, and the last mentioned pressed him strongly to accept an Australian engagement, buthisairangemcnts would not admit of it at the time Mr Toole said he felt very nervous about playing Paul Pry (if he had to play that character he would seek it in as an under study at the end and he battering down the house by a story about an under Study who, on being asked, ' Vi he is the tragedian who is playing Hamlet SO finely replied, ' Oh that sir, is my over Study ' And so his old mend Mr Coppin would kindly be IUB over study Of course first nights were dreadfully nervous affairs and it he played 12 parts he hoped that a fair average would pass off moderately well People persisted in calling him the veteran comedian, but he felt as young as he did 20 years ago, when he was quite a child Mr Toole went on to tell a funny story in regard to the guessing of ages, in which Irving and himself were concerned, and concluded by expressing a hope that his first night deficiencies would be leniently looked at, and that new Friend would have become old friends before he left The Rev Charles Clark proposed The Dra- matic Profession coupled with the names of Mr Coppin and Mr Billington Mr Coppin, who was very heartily received on rising to acknowledge the compliment, referred to the magnificent appointments of the Melbourne theatres of to day, and mentioned that when 41) years ago he announced himself as a stage reformer on the occasion of a production of "The School for Scandal," regardless of expense and covered a few chairs with chintz and spent 19s on a small piece of dragged for the stage, the same lavish praise was bestowed upon his enterprise as that which accompanied the best efforts of the managers of to day it was 25 years since he met Mr Moore, in company with Mr Sothern They looked upon him as a rather green manager from Australia and Sothern played on him a practical joke by making HIS watch seem to strike the hours which rather puzzled him till looke explained that their friend carried machine inside his coat which he could squeeze at will He congratulated the dramatic profession on the great changes which had taken place in the colonial stage, and remarked that he was sure that every one had made up their minds to render the visit of Mr Toole and his company to Australia as agreeable and profitable as possible Mr Billington, who looks as hearty as an English yeoman, also responded, and said it was a pleasure to him to see so many actors looking very much better than they used to when he met them in the Strand (Laughter ) On landing in Australia he felt that it was resents horne from home, and he was sure the company would be received with that sympathy and indulgence which had never been denied to artists visiting Melbourne Songs were contributed by Mr. Boyce and Mr Armes Beaumont. Mr R. S Smythe proposed " The Press," which was acknowleged by Mr. Howard- Wil- loughby and Mr Coppin gave the last toast, that of "The Chairman," observing that the enterprise of Messrs Williamson and Garner had enabled Mr Toole to make his first Australian stage appearance in one of the most beautiful theatres upon the face of the earth. The chairman, in conclud- ing the proceedings, which were of the most pleasant description throughout, mentioned that Mr Doyle had consented to preside, the week after next, at the annual social of the Musical and Dramatic Association, NOTES ON Mit. 'TOOLE ~ " Mr T L Toole opens at the Princess's 'Theatre this evening in two of his favourite pieces, and supported by a new and powerful cast " The Reminiscences of J. L. Toole, Related by) Himself, and Chronicled by Joseph Hatton, which was published in the columns of 'late Atua, has left but very little to tell about the celebrated low comedian, for, as he himself observes, "Hatton has pretty well posted me up to date " Still it may be of interest to mention that Mr Poole is a true Londoner having been born in St, Mar) a Axe, in the city of London, on March 12, IS 22 His father was the city toastmaster, and he passed his play and his school time, and, what was more important, enjoyed his first experiences of the theatre within the bounds of the city John L Toole was made a clerk in a wine merchant's office, but at the same time was a member of the City Histrionic Club, which gave a dramatic performance four times a year, at which large audiences used to assemble, no charge being made for admission from his childhood he evinced the greatest fondness for the theatre, and he had already become a well known future at the performances of the Histrionic Club, when one night, being behind the scenes a benefit night at the Pavilion-an actor who was billed to give imitations of popular favourites failed to put in an appearance, and 'look was persuaded to take his place He scored a decided success, and his professional career may be said to date from that night To enumerate the successive steps by which Mr Poole mounted to his present high position in the theatrical world, or the list of famous impersonations which he has made 80 peculiarly his own 1 The kind!) crew with whom you're cheered life s The people- Pry ' sweet Calebs gentle life 1 the youthful -prij:c,lnBl Garner bowed with an - IS needless, for it would be simply repeating an oft told tale But, while on the subject of Dickens, it may be pointed out what eloquent testimony to the actor's ability is borne by the fact that he was able to embody to the satisfaction of their author, the creations of one of the most subtle de- theaters of humble and eccentric character of the age To completely satisfy the novelist is always a triumph for the actor, for no matter how simple and how true to nature may be the former's portrayal of a character perchance a literary photograph of some original yet the novelist is almost certain to have somewhat idealised the conception, in his own mind at least, if not in the printed pages, and it is therefore necessary for the actor to be able to view the creation exactly as it appears in the eyes of the author -a gut vouchsafed but to few Dickens did not approve of his long novels being dramatised for the stage saying it was impossible to compress into a work for one evening things which had taken him months to write, but he agreed that his shorter stones, more especially the (Christmas Carol, readily lent themselves for adaptation, and he took the greatest interest in Mr Tooleaimperantiu tions That gentleman finds the greatest en jo; ment in bruising the characters of Dickens down to the footlights, but feels so deeply the pathos, beauty, and with these creatures of the great novelist s brum, gets so completely inside his character, that in the part of Caleb Plummer, for instance, he declares he can seldom act it without finding his cheeks wet with genuine tears Our visitor thinks that as a rule people are disappointed at first with an actor about whom they have heard a great deal "The feeling of disappointment wear off in time, and they gradually come to like you as they know you better There is a great deal to both actor and audience in mutually knowing one another well and in getting used to one another, and in the latter become ing acquainted with the actor's personality " The Ladies' Farewell Kettledrum was the most unique of all the festivities to which Mr Toole was bidden and which were given in his honour previous to his departure for Australia. The Kettledrum was held in the Whitehall rooms of the Hotel Metropole, and was presided over by Miss Ellen Terry. Notable amongst the guests were those veterans of the stage, Mrs Kealey (who is in her 85th venrJnndMra Stirling, Mrs Alfred Mellor, Mrs Arthur Stirling (Miss Cleveland), Lady Monckton, Mrs Maxwell (Miss Braddon), Madame Antoinette Sterling, Miss Genevieve Ward, Henry Irving, Bancroft, and many others During a lull in the tea drinking and the music Miss Ellen Terry mounted the platform and made a graceful speech, in which she playfully alluded to the fact that it had been their original intention that Mr Toole should be the only man present, but it was thought it might be awkward for him, seeing that " all the ladies are in love with him Clement Scott wrote a "Song of Friendship" anent the departure of J L 'J Cole, the words of which Henry Irving recited with telling effect at one of the farewell banquets In the last four lines of the last stanza but one occur the words - Our loss when we are parted, will be cain To hearts in hundreds who await to erect Our kin" of kindliness ' White snows of a sin Will meet in flowers of friendship at your feet And those who witnessed the warmth of greeting that awaited the genial actor on his arrival in the bus, and the hearty reception accorded to him at the welcome banquet, are under the impression that those "flowers of friendship ' blossomed long ago
