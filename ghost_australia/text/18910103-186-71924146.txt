OUPHAKT, Anifaor of 'The .Son of his Father,1' 'Sir Tom,' 'Hie Chronicles of Catiingford,' **NetghbtHn*B on the Green,' 'Oliver's Bride/* &c;, &c.; [all jughis reserved.] ' I am caning^to believe thitt my sisterin law is not .a woman at all, bat a bundle of virtues,' said Lord Frogznore. *? Oh not that i' cried Mary, with a Mnah, 'not that at aU. Sic has her faults, of course — bother -whole heart is in bar own family, to do cverythinc for them ? *' ' At all events eh.o has one great quality — she hA the art of ^if-Vitig a devoted friend,' fiud Lord FrogwoiV^ritli a smile which made Mary blush again. ** Oh,' die cried, *' I am of so little account I ean ue(er do anything for her — except the Smallest Hangs.' '.Such ae taking care of an old bore with a cold,' said tfce old geatieman. Mary felt that she had not Leen warm enough in Leiitia's praises, for -he never shook off that cynical loo^, while certainly )T-ffti^w- might have eliowgd him a little more attention. Mary woadcred somedmeK if it tvas true that she herself found it easy to make up a. face and tgfmp&thiac; with people, and if Letitia was, as e&m;: said, too sincere. She found herself eyropethidng with Lord Frogmore in a way tdiich perhaps was absurd, foe iie was not ill : he was ratjjy enjoying his cold and all the attentions it procured him. It vras had weather, and there was no temptation to go out. It was not aa ifhc were really IU, and |£ .Was pi act aide votioa to nurse him. Was she inaking up a face ? Mary said to herself ' No,' wtth a little indignation. *She did not fed herself to!be insincere. Still, perhaps it fras easier for her than for Letitaalo show c^pafhy with other people's troubles, wiiethcr^Ecy were small or great. Lord Frogmore cot better, and went away haling considerably otrtetayed the original limits of hjB visit. And to tell the truth his going -was a great relief to the household, except to UbtV| who nussod him very mucb. Tie l*arkea by this tune had got rid of their a.Utilejroundof vifiitB to taste other people's dionetB and shoot other people 'a covers. On such occasions, ft'liich occurred periodlififiy, Mary was {eft in charge of the house 8be had to keep tie net-rants in hand, vhich-was not on easy task, for they all knew that she wasa dependant without wages, audimtaxaily Leld her authority very light; andehethadto walch .over £hc children, vo send for the doctor when he was wanted, to superintend the noises, jto ' keep everything in the established routine. It w£s not a pleasant office, for nobody in the house chose to l-e 4nbonlinate to a poor lady who was not oven the g6rerncss-r4rfio waa only a friend and of no account persoiiaSy, living on tlic kindness of fhc mistress of the house. This did notr account, however, for tho excitement with which die rushed into Letifaiafe boudoir on the morttjife of their departure, looking alter iShiel^Very red and very white, and scarcely able to epuak for an agitation which took away her breath. 'Oh, Letitia, can I speak to you?' she cned, lHirsting into the room in a manner quite unlike her usual soft movements. .Letatia was at the moment aupcrinteading the drafting np of her l»x, in wliich all her best dresses were, and which was reluctant to dose. ' Well, my dear, you can speak as much as you like : but as for expecting me io ywv auy attention just at tin's nmmeut, wins, I a-n in the agouies «jf packing - Km-ul on the lid, Fcliaic, and Fll try ami tarn Hie toy. -' '?Letitia, plcasw, jost a moment, There's something which I want to tell you — tit consult you alwnt.'

Oh, Letitia, it is from an old gentleman, one much older, and far above me.' ** Did yon expect a yonng one V said Mrs. Parke. V I think you would be very, very sQly to etand upon that. I- know who it is. It is old lie, Hilton ; and just an excellent match — an admirable match — die very tiling I should have wished for you. Old ! I hope yon axe not such a fool as to think of tliat !

Don't be a fooL' tf ' But it's not Dr. BHton. Oh Letitiaronly a moment ; X mast sneak to you.' ' There is John calling,' said Mrs. Parke, composedly. *4 Good-bye, Mary, I can't stop a moment longer. Take care of the boy, and mind you don t let Sounders and the rest get the upper hand. Who can it be if it'e not Dr. Hilton? But whoever it is, mind what I say.' What doea age matter ! If he can support you, and leave you something when he dies, take him, take him, Mar}' IJffl — at your age what conld you expect oSbre.^ . Mary followed her friend downstairs. It was of no nsc saj'ing any more. Mrs. Parkc had many direetaouB to give as she went away, She had to say goo-l-byc to the children who were in the hall to sec the last of mamma. She had to silence John wiio was calling to her, to question Letitia who lagged behind, 'Mind you take care of the ltoy,' she said, looking back, waving her hand to Mary. ** Mind yon keep everything going : and yon can write and tell me all about it. Nurse, if there is anything the matter call M«^ Hill at once and she will know what to do. Tata baby, good-Lye Duke. Mind yon're good till I come back : and good-bye Letty and Johnny, be good children all of you. Felicie, what on earth keeps you always behind.' Then the carriage rolled away, followed by the cab with Felide and the boxes, and still ness fell upon the abandoned Loose ; stillness at least so far as the eitting-roams were con cerned ; but a louder note than usual from the nurseries, and a jovial ham in tbe servants' hall, where everybody felt their holiday had begun. Mary went back into the boose from the doorsteps, on which she had been standing dazed, contemplating the carriage and Felide 's cab as they rolled away. She came in lit-p a ghost, her face very pale, lier limbs trembling with, an agitation wliich was only increased by the fact that Letitia was now permanently out of hearing, and that there was nobody left from whom she could aak any advice. She wandered up and down the different rooms for some time, seating herself here and there /or a moment, tiien springing up again lo trv another chair and another position. At last die went into the library and sat down upon a low chair l*cforc the fireplace. There was no fire in that room, which was not a room ordinarily much frequented by the ladies of die house, and the first to foil into the* ucglcci wliicb characterises a house from which the masters arc absent. The fire bad not been lighted though it was November and a dul cold day. Mary sat down upon this little chair l»y the cold hWth, and sbe covered her face with her hands and leaned her. head against the ana of the great chair which stood close to her. Here for a moment she could rest and think. She sat quitf still for a long time in the alisoiute solitude of the ]daco. and covered her eyes from all external distractions — but it -would scarcely lie just to say tbat Jlarv was tJiinkiiiq, much' loss that she was wisely lialancing the jroo.1 against the .en!. and liinkinp up her jniml wliaT she sIimiiU do.

If It did no more than this for her, it had done what wordt could not express. She sat biding bra- face and felt this ljalm steal over and heal her wounds. And ituras only after thifi, after a long interval, after the first whiri of agitation and the hash of gratified and* soothed sensation, the charm and sweetness of being at leutrth appreciated and understood — that Mary began to think — what answer was sho to make-! — what was she to do? Chattee XIV. It is a great wonder in morals that tbe chances of raatrinionial ^nvnty** whicli inay occur in the life of an unmarried woman, absolntely at any moment, should not exercise a more demoralising effect than they do upon the feminine mind. It is alwaj's possible, not only for a girl, but evqnjqr a woman who has reached the middle of life to have hex position and prospects -&anced; in a moment as by the waving of a magician's hand-— and that probably not by any virtue or by any exertion of her own, fortultionsly, accidentally, by what seems mere chance and cood fortune. A poor girl, the daughter of a fallen family, ?with very little natural prospect of advance ment in any direction, will suddenly wake to find herself a duchess, placed on the veiy highest pinnacle of fortune ; a poor woman who has passed half of ber life in a straggle with poverty will be lifted into sudden enjoyment of wealth and all that it brings. Why? By die merest chance. By pleasing someone, possibly unawares, without any intention — possibly, it is true, by the exercise of all her gifts for the puipose. . And il by no means follows that tuesc extraordinary chances involved any revolting bargains, any sale or barter of an odious kind. The girl may love her duke and the woman her billionaire just as mnch as if the duke was a lien tenant in a march in c regiment or the millionaire a linker's clerk. It is astonishing that women should lie so little demoralised by the possibility of such an accident. It may be said that i£ happens rarely. StQl it does happen, and everybody knows one instance at least, . * Such an accident - had now happened to Mary HUl^Such a thing as marriage had long passed out of her thoughts. She had gone through the ordinary process in such matters, having had her youthful dreams, her time, some day, the hero would come round the torn of die road, and life -amid change into enchantment. For a certain period in life that is to a girl the one -certainty. Per haps not to-day or to-morrow; yet possibly at any moment — a thing as sure as tbe rising of the son, yet veiled in delightful mysteries and onknowableness — a vague, anticipation, the poem of existence.. After a time,' if Prince Charming does notapjkear, the expectation be cins to flag — a curious question, the strangest discouraging doubt creeps into the mind. Is ehe perhaps to be the one left oat t the ontAb whom the encbantcris not to come. To trace the process from tliat first doubt, which is eo to the calm certainty that no such thing -would ever happen to her, which liod long filled the gen|3e bosom of Mary HiU, would take too much time and space. It ceetla only be said that Mary )ia4 accepted the position years ago. Her sister Agnes and she had long given up any thoughts of the kind. Their heatrs fluttered no longer wbeu they gazed along the blank road by which no hero bad ever come. They had&ettlcd-downau; middle aged women. Xo doubt tliey bad both known what it was to struggle .and rebel in their hearts against tlic strait Jnmdage of life that confined them, Oic situation of girls in their father's boose which was so sweet at twenty^ so little adapted to the maiden mind at forty. They had gone thron^h all that, but had never said anything about it even to tadi other. Most proliably they wnnld have thought it uiuful, komblv unwomanly to Veliel thus a^ain&t; their lot.

Her heart jumped up to think of these Jiangs, then dropped down again with a ranking fall vben her mind turned to the other nde, and she thought of Letitia. Oh, it was needless to try to persuade bereclf that when Letitia. said, ' Don't bs a fool, Haxy ™° and liade her certainly to accept the old gentliaaan wbo had proposed to lier, Mrs. Parke bad any per ception of the real state of the case. Had Letitia. guessed tint it -was Lard Frogmore; had filie for an instant suspected that her humble friend was to he elevated over lier own head, no doubt she would hare given a very different verdict. Mary remembered all she had said. Her mmw that notliine must be expected from 'Frogmore, Hiat all be had mnst come to the children, tffix resent ment with Lia care of his own health as keeping her out of her kingdom. Her/ heart sank lower and lower as she thought of this. What would Letitia -cay f f aht knar ? Mary immediately realised that' Letitia, wonVl not only ea3~, hut do anything a desperate woman could to stop it. She would bemad with fnry and passion. .She would publish her wrong, her, vision of rfac story, her account of bow ilarv Hill had '* made np ^ to the old lord. And' yet in her hcedlcssneas sbe had bidden her dependent t» accept the old gentleman, td coarse, whoever he was, so long as he could provide for her, . Mary sat and thou#it over - all these things tQl her bead ached and ber brain grew dizzy. She *m stiff with cold aud agitation and excitement when ebe got up at last and crept away t6 tile dying fire in the mommg-room, which was the only room where any comfort was. Sbe knew already that to be left in charge of the house when the Parkea were awnj- was no pleasant office. Tlie iire in the morning-room was tiie only fire in that part of the bouse inhabited by its xnastjcis. All the rest bad f&Uen; into gtoom and emptiness. Mary met the hodsemaids withtbeirpaiisas she went npataira — a tfcing, it need scarcely be said, never visible when Mrs. Parkes was at home. She saw Sansders as sbe crossed the haU lounging in bis sbirt sleeves, and felt die footman's tobacco. Xobody cared to keep up die decorum nS die household for Miss 'HilL Who was Miss Hill? Lss, a great deal than an upper servant, who was well paid' and knew hts Igace. Nobody bad the least intention «f putting himself or bcrself to any restraint or inconvenience to please Miss will Mary knew this very well, and knew it would lie necessary to ask as little as possible in order to avoid impertineace. She knew that sbe was not wanted, that she was considered'* spj', left to report upon their doings and limit their freedom. She mended the fire witti economy, hoping to lie able to keep herself warm all day with tbe contents of the coal scuttle, not to have to appeal to Slanders for more And 'if tliey only knew! To think that she had so much in her power lying at her feet, waiting her compliance. She laughed nnconscionsly as die thought of it, and how those impudent serranU woold abase themselves, and people of far more importance bon- before her and pat on tbeir.best smiles, and all for no virtue of her's, for no change in her, for nothing, lint because she had it in her power to become Lady Fitnrmore. ? The reader may think that in all tniB ibcre was but Hule question of the chief matter involved, of Lorn Frogtnure himself, the old gentleman who had it in his power to do » much for Mary. But this did cot invdre tbe injury to him that might be supposed, lor, as a matter of faci, the idea of acceptxog uira Frogmore, and living with him and taking care of him was in no way disagreeable to Mai}-. Sbe liked the old lord. He bad never been anything but kind, xcspectfnl. sympathetic to her ; be had greatly comforted lier amour ;»ro;?re, which was often touched in Letitia's house and by Letitia's friends. He had even raised her own opinion of her self which had been sadly broken down by continual . fin'ubbing. In every way hhl so:fcty, his friendship, his kindness had been good for Mot-. Love was riot a thing to be thought of, it'was out of -date, it was scarcely mudest even to snjrgcst it : I-ut that she could ami did fool aneotioiiately towards Lord Frog. more. -Mary had no duuht, and he asKed for no more.
