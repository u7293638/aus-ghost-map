J 1ST ENGLAND.— HOO'S THAT? ta a? ( 4 uplift u.n1#1 Sir, — Your "County Palatino" ap pears ta bo an awfu' weel loarnt'mnn. I aye thocht my auld ministor had gi'en mo a wee bit o' Scotch history ; but, puir mon I he has been wrang. Wha but the " count could hao dreamt o Uromwell cainiu' a' tbe road tao Scotland te fecbt the Battle u' Worcester ? What an "omnipotent" arm the Protector had I Puir, simple, atraucht farrit Leslie at Dunbar, iu a spirit of generosity tho Count" should noto, released Crom well from the "corner" ho vros ia. That's ancient history. " Boddell Brig " I ken ; and I fancy I hao reverently stood at " Drumclog " wi' feelins o' pride tlmb n few almost weaponless Cove nanters in 1G79 dared to be "men" for— not Scotland alone, but for a principle that overy Briton approve. " County Palatine" in Scotch parlance is "snauld wife, a Wethor." He disna kon what he's speakin' aboot. And, worso thaii that, he disna koa hoo to speak aboot it. " Aasasain&tion;, massacres!" Ho's ricbt. It's a groat peety he ohose 1G89— to the TJnien. Did he ever hear o' twa masincres during that poricd t Did ho ever hear o' u Glencoo " nnd "Darien" 1 1 thocht, Sir, the mention of sich things was a thing o' the past ; but the "Count's" enthusiasm for prop&gatin;' kindliness among " John Tamton's bairns excuses him. I wad suggest lao His Highness the " Count Palatine o' tho Rhine " to gang back to tho schulo, and mnybo tnixin' wi' tbe sons o' English, Irish, Scotch, Germane, etc., wall gie him a true idea of hoo the Scots strug gled, They novor refused tae help a bnther — be ho Irish or Fronoh — pro vided tho watch-word was Liberty. May I suggest audi plaoes as Bulgaria, Armouia, to gie iiim an idea o' what goaded the Seots on ? I raither think the 00001" liasna been lang oot; or, if he has, his acquaintance wi other nation alities ia limited. Shame on the man who is ashamed to stick up for bis country I Moybo I am unco hard on the "Count." He's no feert tae talk aboot nowntities" and ' cbildisness." (How's Kew 1) Mnybo he believes ia ghosts, and has been " coached " in Sootch history by tho shados o' renegades of tho poriod he. ipoaks. Maybe ye wud lot mo tell a story- oven though a chestnut ? At a social in Edinburgh seme men were mentioning tho personages thoy hod been mistaken for, "Tho Prince," "Lord This," "Count That," had been often tendered according to the speaker. At lest one entlotnan got up. 'J Abom i As I was itinerating aleng Princo's streot— don't you know ?— a superior-looking individual came up to me, and, elovating his arini, ho gasped out, ' God Almighty 1 Is this yon 1' The mooting dinpersod. Noo, Sir. what I wad like tae' kon is— 1\. Was the " Ooant" ever in Edinburgh 7 2\. Was he there on that perteeklar day 7 3\. If so, was ho at that xuooben? 4. If ho was, wan he tho lost speaker 7 If yoo can see your way to insert this frao ano who believes that the spirit displayed in the " Count's" correspondence is at least half a century oot o1 dale, — You will ohlica BAWBEES.
