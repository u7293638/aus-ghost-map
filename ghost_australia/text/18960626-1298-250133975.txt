in English Faranhouse. [By a Villages.] Did you ever live on a farm ? Da oa know what it to hear the stir of life begin wi h the first dawu of the tnorving ? Just about the time when ou townsfolk have put all your lights ut, when the door is bolted and, chained, and the last tired servant bae suc eeJidin getting to bed, tt.en, or very soon afte>-, tlie durk grey of our winiiow grows a shade or two lighter, and we bngin to think of getting up. The cows are brought in, the farm men are liuSy, thers is a cheerful chatter all ver the yards, the milk pails are emptied into the cheese tab, and the che> semaking is well hegun long before your first cleepy housemaid 1ns strayed down to light a fire. I am afraid that there are some of you who have barely finished supper when *»e are sitting down to ba. on and egfjs— the b«con of our own pigs and the eggs f our own fowls. £y half past 9 breakfast has receded so far into the past that we need some physical support to carry us on (o 12 o'clock dinner considerable piece of bread and cheese or so. Do you know the industry thatgoeB on all the long morning 1 The day of the country., consists chiefly of the morning. All business is done then. Out of doors is the haymaking or the thn shing or the reaping, each at the fitting time of year; but it is thejndo'or work th it I mean just now. Have you watched th- succession of men—milkmaids art? out of date in our parts—steadying the milkpails on one shoulder aB they carry them in ? Have you heard the swirl of the milk as it is poured into.the shallow leaden trough at night, and admired the unbroken yellowish surface in tbe morn ing before tbe dairymaid comes with pitiless skimmer to take off that rich cream for Thursday's buttermaking 1 We have none of your new inventions of separators and :he like. We are prejudiced agair st machine-made butter, which set- too griat a mystery between the cow and the consumer. One of tbe early morning "duties is the running off of the sfcirame 1 milk and the mixing of it in the great tin tub with the fresh creamy stuff just brought in. Then comeB the putting in of the rennet, which is to change the white iiquid into a depth of sumi- Boli'i curd nbove and green, transparent whey below. Not till after the Bouse is made i nmaculately clean in every corner, n< t ' till after we have taken our interpolated bread and cheese, in the long gridiron at the end bf a po1<introduced int o the marble surface of the curd, which immediately closes together and tries to look as ifitt beautiful smoothness had never been disturbed. But in vain, for the instrument breuks and dashes and whirl" it round and round. All the polish of its surface is lost, but it is acquiring firmer substance"under the tribulation, &o; £hat presently the great, tap under the tub can le turned, the green wfyiy let t'J escape, and the cruml ly. grny whjie curd lie ready for the vat. Then, when the sun i* getting near t > itthijgbfst point, %i)d when the great pp: thst hangs over* the . open fire in ihe kitq en begins to «end out an attractive, smed, the . giay-white cuceT,; nearly sblifl no*, inui»t be taken bat irom the bottom of the tub aud placed in the round vats, w)»ich will give it, the proper sbape.

I tlotffc believe that any country can produce more deliciousfairfl thai /the custards and cheese-cake^ the .home-raised chickens, and the home^3tif4d hattis X)f our farms. And I give the fir^t;two the places of honour. The style mfiy be plain, but the dishes a' e good .'fofea.,> hungry man. We keep to the gtjefii: " kitchen for our meals. The wooden settle still provides seats and shelter from draught for half-a- dozen pdople, and we us j for their proper purpose the heavy old carved oak stools which you have the eccrentic taste to value as drawing-room tables, and that when you might get nice- new furniture in the latest fashion out of shops. After dinner i< the time for meditation, and meditation generally resolves itself into sleep. Consider the length of our uiorning, beginning somewheie about 5 and going on till 12. You can do the I est part of the day's work in that time, and your reflections afterwards upon the state of the nation and the turnips pass very quickly into snores The time is favourable to sleep, it is so warm and .still. The faint buzz of the threshing machine on the npxt farn. comes through the open casement. A bird cheeps faintly. A steady tick-tack sounds fr >m the tall clock. The maids clatter f'»r a little while with dishes and tin pails ; then they disappear to mnke themselves smart for the evening, and there is no other auclible movement than the pendulum's through the house. In tbe summer and autumn doors and windows stand wide open. Nothing enters but the sunshiny air, or a daring sparrow who has so much trust in the improbable as to look for crambs on. that clean-swept floor. There must be something done before the early farmhouse tea, of course, to satisfy the conscience that one haearned the refreshment. But the conscience is amiable at this time <f the day. It is not too exacjfihg. It will take a poor pretence for real thing. Raspberries fresh from the bushes, cold red-currant pie with cream —a very refreshing dish on a summer afternoon—fresh-cut salad from the garden, country bread and butter— these are the materials of a.farmhouse tea. It is an excellent institution for hot and weary people. Perhaps it is unrefined, but hucger is stronger than refinement, and among the long list of diseases unknown to us and painfully familiar to you is indigestion. After the e»rly and not unsub'atatitial tneal which we call tea"comes the pleasant' st part of the day. The cowb come in for the evening milking, and saunter back again, quite aware that at this hour.it befits serious creatures to take life in a leisurely way. The pai's are carried more slowly, the very rosh of the milk into the leads sounds gentler, the, scent of the monthly roses begins to impregnate the cooler air. Then the dairymaids must look to their new-made cheeses. Those pale aind limp ghosts of their future selves must, be token from their vats and their wrappings. They must be put through' a mill,'ground to bite, and salted. They must go back again Jtnd suffer severer and Still severer pressure, until that severe judge—the/ mistress —pronoaceS them fit to pass to the warm apartment upstairs, wrapped ' ;always in 'a yellow gloom,' where they 'must be stored bn the.^helveSi,an<i carefully arrti&aten.; J$Se' last of Ibip jgfg&t; doors of the m#ti have slouched .^otta'g^s^tid. tlieii; sa| staledth»;| inveiigk^d the cd^l tabid teds.
