Miss Roxy Barton's delioato hundling.'' of '.tho part ofv: tho blind -girl was greutiv admired. Mr. . Inmen also did -- excellent . work as the hero. Tbe comedy scene, where the Jack Tar tells a ghost story to tho.policemun, went . uproariously. On Monday evening wo are to have'Mr.Holloway's great production of. "The Power and tho : Glory," whioh by southern critics has been stamped, as the crowning .triumph of Mr. Hoiloway's career, as a.pro- duuer of plays. Says a Melbourne exchange : " 'Tlie Power, and the Glory,.' possesses the elements of upopularproduoUon. The scenery ie splendid, and Mr. Holloway must bo con gratulated on the management that roado tho whole gorgeous speotade uiovo eo "easily. As a stage und scenic effect -nothing has . ever been seen in Melbourne -fluer than tho views of London by night, as viewed . from the top of tbe monument.- The audience, - look ing down on the roofs. . and . lighted .streets of the great /'.city that : never sleeps, were completely carried awuy, aud called the artist twice to receive, their plaudits. The' transformation scene, ' Brit annia aud Her Sous,' 'which concludes the drama, is also a piece of . work that reflects tho . highest credit on both artist and mechanist." .
