'DONAL grants By George Macdonald. Author of " Alec Forbes," "Malcolm," c, c. Chapter XLII. Whatever Lady Aretuia might decide concerning the restoration of the chapel for the light of day, Donal thought it would not be amiss for him, without mentioning it to her, or troubling ker nervous nature with further strain of anxious my estimation, to find out what he could about the relations of the place to the rest of the house in any case to come that would be something gained It favoured his wish that the next day At retina was pi c called upon by the housekeeper to remain in bed, and so removed from the fatigue and loss of sleep of the previous nights, the i e action from their excitement was great exhaustion Her strong will, good courage, and trusting heart had made severe demands upon an organisation as delicate as it was despotic in part by wondrous variety of confers ition does God work out his lovely differing men and women So that being Saturday he i esoli ed to go down alone that afternoon, tclhngnoone and explore First of all he would try to open the door on a level with the 'little galler As soon as he was free, Therefore, he got the tools he judged likely to be necessary, and went down The door was of strong sound oak, with ornate iron hinges going all across it He was on the better side for opening it, that is the inside, but, though the cells of the finger and then bearing pins in the wall were exposed, he soon saw that the door was so well within the of came that it w as useless to think of heaving the former off the latter The lock and its bolt here likewise exposed to his examination and attack , they were huge, and the key was on the other side and in the lock, so that he could not have picked it had he been more of a locksmith than he was, while the nails that fastened it to the door were so hard fixed that he was compelled to give up the idea of removing it, they w ere probably meted through a plate of iron on the other side But there was the socket into which the bolt shoremen ely as now staple He might either for ce this out with a lawyer if he could find one strong enough and could manage to apply it, 01, which was the more hopeful way, he might file it through He would try the latter mode, when he had roughly removed the scales of nist with which it is is caked he found its thickness considerably less than it seemed, and set himself to the task of filing it through, first on the top and then at the bottom It was a slow but a sine process and would be in less danger of being heard than anymore violent one But, although it was let for a time broad daylight outside, so like midnight was it, and the season that belongs to the dead that he was haunted with the idea that there was a presence behind him But he would not turn his head to see, for he felt that if he were once to yield to the inclination he would be stopping every moment to satisfy himself that he was alone so far at least as his senses could tell him He knew also, from our childish experience, that the way to meet the honors of the imagination is to yield not one hands breadth to then in tensions and suggestions , so not once while he worked did he turn his head. The work was very slow-the impt session he made on the laid non with the worn hie only enough to pi c ont him from tm owing it aside as useless He went on at it for a long, time until at last w our mess began to attack him, and with that the sense of his situation grew mockery He did not go back that night, but went in stead to the town to buy a new and more suitable site The next day was Sunday It was night on the Monday before Doing again went down into the hidden parts of the castle As time had come to the schoolroom, but seemed ill able for his work, and Donal would not tell her what he was doing this, for fear of making her think of things it was better should eli if a further away in the past of her memory But he was certain she would never he quite herself until the, 1 plight entered the chapel, and all the hidden places of the house were open to the air of Gods world Sobo thought he would this time for her sake encounter the powers of darkness in their own home , he would not have her know, and besides he was desirous of entirely overcoming the weakness that rendered it possible for him to be every now and then again And this time he was less assailed by the ghosts of fear s i rather than by the Eastham sch cs neither was he in any way greatly dis the bed With his new life he had made better work therefore, and had soon finished cutting through the top of the staple Ti ymg it then Mitha poker he had brought down for a lever, he broke the bottom part close, and there was nothing to hold the bolt, with a little or caking noise of rusty hinges the door slowly opened to his steady pull on the lock He threw the light of his candle into the space enclosed, there was nothing as it appeared but a close set can or wall of place When he gav e it a push, however it yielded, it was close fitting, and without any fastening It disclosed a small hanging closet or mess-on the opposite side of which was another door This he could not at once open Plainly, however, it was secured with merely a small common took, such as is on any cupboard, and it cost him little trouble to force it The door opened out and, he looked in, and saw a little room of about 9ft by 7ft Casting a hasty glance round, he entered There was in it nothing but an old fashioned secretary of bureau, not so old, it still lick him at once, as that he had seen in Mother House in the town, and a seat like a lot music stool before "It may have been arrested for the priest," thought Donal, ' ' but it must have been used much later than the chapel, for this desk is not much older than the one at the Mains and I once heard Mistress Jean say that was made for her grandmother 1 ' How did it just get into the little place ' He looked all round the walls were continuous , therewas not, there could not be, another door ' Above the bureau was a little window in one or it seemed to be a window, but it was so overgrown with dust that he could not certainly tell whether it was more than the blind show of an eye with a wall behind it, but door certainly there was not It might get through the oak door behind, but it could not, he thought, have reached that through any of the passages he had come through, me! if there had been any wider approach in that direction surely it had been built up long before this piece of furniture was made If his observations and i reasonings were correct, it followed that there must, and that not so very long ago, have been another entrance to the place in which he stood There might be something in the bureau to reveal how it had come there, or at least to show about what time it had been left there He turned to look at the way he had himself entered, it was through a common looking press of painted deal, that filled up the end of the little room, which there narrowed to about 5ft When the door in the back of it was shut, it looked merely the back of the press He turned again to the bureau There was a strange feeling at his heart Buthoneier thought whether or not be had a light to look into it he felt himself all the time acting society and only in the service of Lady Arc time Besides, why should he imagine any body's secret there' Nobody nine, he would have said to himself, had the question come to him, could know of this chamber The bureau stood open-that is, with the cover down, and on it lay writing paper, some of it in large sheets, some of quite modern aspect and size, but all stained with dust and age and blots A pen lay with them, and beside was a glass ink bottle of the commonest type, in which the ink had dried into cakes and flakes He took up one of the sheets with a great stain on it Why did he look at it so The bottle must have been overturned ' But was it ink 2 No, it could not be It stood up too thick on the paper with a gruesome shiver Donal wetted his finger, and tried the surface of it a little came off, and looked of a faint suspicious brown What was written on the paper' He held the faded lines close to the candle, and tried to decipher them. It was not difficult ' He sat down on the stool, and read thus-his reading broken by the spot which had for the present obliterated a part of the writing there was no date "My husband for such I will-blot-aie in the sight of God-blot-men why are you so cruel what-blot-deserve these terrors-blot in thought have I-blot-hard upon me to think of another " Here the writing came below the shot and went on unbroken " My little one is gone and I am left lonely, oh so lonely I cannot but think that if you had loved me as you once did I should yet be clasping my little one to my bosom, and you would have a daughter to comfort you after I am gone I feel sure I cannot long survive this-ah, there my hand has burst out bleeding again, but do not think I mind it I know it was only an accident You never meant to do it, though you teased me by refusing to say so-besides it is nothing You might draw every drop of blood from my body and I would not care, if only you would not make my heart bleed so Oh it has gone all over my paper, and you will think I have done it to let you see how it 3 [The sole right of publication in Queensland of Donal Grant has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, Limited When are you going down again to chapel Mr Grant said Lady Aicturn, bleeds-but I cannot write it all over again it is too great a labour and too painful to write, so you must see it just as it is. But I dare not think where my baby is, for if I should be doomed never to see her because of the love I have borne to you and consented to be as you wished, if I am cast out from my God because I loved you more than Him I shall never see you again, for to be where I could see you would never be punishment enough for my sins." Here the writing stopped abruptly, the bleeding of the hand had probably brought it to a close, and it had never been folded up and never sent, but lying there had lain there He looked if he could anywhere find a date, there was none upon the sheet he had read He held it up to the light, and saw a paper mark and close by lay another sheet with merely a date, in the capable hands rising, as if the writer had been about to commence another in lieu perhaps of the letter spoiled He laid the papers thoughtfully down How strange ' an old withered grief looks almost as pathetic as an old withered joys But who was to say they were withered ' the same who look upon death as an evil, jet romani it as the head of sorrows' Who can tell how long a grief may last unwatered ed " Surely), thought Donal, ' till the life heads it. He is a coward who would lose his sorrow by the mere lapse of time the mere forgetting of a blain growing musty with old age. It is God alone who can heal-the God of the dead and of the living' and the dead must find him, or be miserable for ev enmore ' ' He took a packet of papers from a pigeon whole of the desk, and undid the string round them, they were but bills, but they had plenty of dates He had not a doubt left that the letter he had partly lead was in the writing of the late wife of the present early life as she had been considered, wife as, Donal was sure, she was to be called only by the worlds courtesy and God's truth, not by the world's law What was he to do now ' He had thought he was looking into matters much older - things over which the permission of Lady Victoria, by right extended, was enough, but now he knew differently) Still, the things he had discovered were only such as she had a right to know, though whether he was to tell her at once he would not yet make up his mind He put the papers back, took up his candle, and with a feeling of helpless dismay such as had never before oppressed her, and which destroyed all sense of fear as he went, withdrew to his own chamber When he reached the door of it leading to a sudden impulse, he turned away, went further up the stairs, and out upon the roof He turned and stood looking over the cold sea Over his head the sky was full of sharing worlds most of them doubtless only in process of making-to be mansions in the Father s house. at last, and he thought, as he was often glad to think, that instead of our being; at the end of things, where they are all growing old and thawing near to their final lost, we are but in the beginnings and on the threshold of creation that our i father is as young as ever he was, a God who, while he is the ancient of days, can get never grow old and that he who has filled the dull unbelieving nations with food and gladness his a splendour of delight over preparing for the souls which as constantly as he is creating as coast only is he reducing and enlarging to the receiving and holding of his might) ever growing joy Cn ii Tru XLV the the next day after school She was better, and had come again to lessons "I want to go this evening-by myself if you dont mind, my lad), he answered I want to find out all I can about it, but I can't help thinking it would be better for you not to go down again till you are ready to order everything to be cleared away) between it and the open world You can stand the damp and bad air of the place If I were you, I would have it done, and say nothing till it was done "I think it was rather the want of sleep that made me ill, she answered, ' but you can do just as you please You have as great a a respect for what is old as I have no) self, and I am not afraid of anything you will do " I thank on for ) our confidence, my lad), returned Donal I do not think you will repent it ' ' I know I shall not So again at night Donal went down this time chiefly intent on learning whether there was any other way open out of it, and on verifying its position in the castle, of which he had now a pretty good idea He went first to the end of the passage parallel with the length of the chapel and turning round the west end of it, and there examined the signs he had before observed Yo3! sure enough those must be the outer ends of two of the steps of the great staircase. coming through and resting on the wall' That end of the chapel then was close to the great sea at stan Plainly, too, a door had been there built up in the process of constructing the stair The chapel had not been entered from that level at least since the building of the great stand Before that, there had probably been an outside stand to this doom, in an open court, and, if the chapel was rendered inaccessible before the spiral stair was built, one of the means was probably the removing of the said state Finding no other suggested direction for admit), he was on his way out, and already near the top of the staff in the wall, thinking with himself that in the morning he would take fresh observations outside, when up from behind, over taking him as if sent after him from the legions he had left, came a blast of an, and blew out his candle He shivered not with the cold of it though it be called of underground damp and doubtful growths but from a feeling of its unknown origin, and the thought whether it might not have come after him to make him go down again Anyhow it seemed to indicate some opening to the enter an which he had not discovered He made haste to light his candle, turned and again descended, carefully guarding it with one hand, and thinking as he went that, go scheme as that cold sigh seemed, coming as from a shut up depth with which the world of light had nothing to do, its tenor might be but the messenger, the outward and visible Biennial), even the offspring of something at hand to destroy fern and give rest But might not the wind have been a draught down the shaft in which were stretched the music chords " No, for in that case they would have loosed some light winged messenger with it 1 It must come from lower at least than that, indicating some gap he had failed to find if it would but come again when he was below ! He crossed the little gallery, descended, and went into the chapel it lay as still as a tomb, but because it was a tomb no more he felt as if it were deserted-as if some life had gone out of it 1 He looked all round it, searching closely the walls where he could reach, and staring as high as the light would show, but could perceive no sign of possible entrance for the messenger blast But just as he was leaving it the w mu came again placidly along the little passage he had left but a few minutes ago Itkeptblowingvvhcnhoturncd into it, and now be thought it came upwards As he stooped to examine the lower parts of the passage his light was again blown out, and therewith he was surprised to find how much he had got over the terrors of the place Any thing in the least unexpected might at once call them back, but in the meantime he had ceased almost to think of them Having once more he lighted his candle, he searched along the floor and the adjacent parts of the walls, and presently found close to the floor, in the inner wall that is, the wall of the chapel itself-an opening that seemed to go down wards through it But if that was its direction why had he not seen it inside the chapel' He then, thinking, recalled that, although from the landing place of the stair there was a step down into the chapel, there were three or four down to the passage, and concluded therefore that this opening went down under the floor of the chapel-probably into a crypt, where not unlikely lay yet more dust of the dead if there was here a way into that he might be nearer a. way out The opening showed only a mere narrow silt, but there might be more of it under the floor, and among the slabs with which it was played was one that went all the length of the slit He would try to raise this one That would want a crowbar He would get one at once Having got so far, he could not restful he knew more It must be very late. Would the people in the castle be in bed yet' He could not tell, he had left his watch in his room It might be midnight. He crept up again and out lay his own turn at stair, and so to the tool house, which he found locked But lying near was a half worn shovel, which he thought might do, he would have a try with it So, like one in a terrible dream of ancient ruins he is doomed to haunt, creeping through all sorts of mouldy and low by owed places, he went once more into the entrails of the house, and down to the place of its darkness There, endeavouring to insert the sharp edge of the worn show elm the gap between the stone he wanted to raine and one next it, he succeeded even more readily than he had dated hope He soon lifted it, is closing the slope as of the bottom of a small window down into a place below How deep the place might be, and whether it would be possible to get out of it again, he must try to discover before venturing down There could be small risk of setting such a place on fire , he took a letter from his pocket, and lighting it, threw it in It fell and burned on some thing that looked like a small Hat gravestone, with a skeleton called upon it. The descent was little more than about 7ft, into what looked like a collar He hesitated no longer, but, blowing his candle out, and putting it into his pocket lest he should lose it, got into the opening, abel down the slope, and all in the dark, dropped-with no further hint than grazing his nose on the wall as he descended He then relighted his candle, and looked about him There was the flat stone, about big enough for a child s grave, but with nothing like a skeleton upon it it did look like a gravestone, but there was not even an inscription upon it. It lay in a vaulted place, unpaved, with a tool of hard beaten earth Searching about the walls he soon caught sight of what looked like the top of an inch using from the floor in one of them, is near as he could judge just under the built up door in the passage above there was room enough to cr cop through He slept, and found him self under the first round of the great sprint star On the floor of the small enclosed space at the bottom of its well was a crust p in met a housemaids blush-and there was the only door at which they were shovel in after their mornings use upon the stair enough that he crept next he was in the great hall of the house, from which the star ascended Afraid of being by any chance discover ed, he put out his light, and proceeded up the staff in the dark He had gone but a few steps when he heard the sound of descending feet He listened and listened , they turned into the room on the star As he crept past it, he heard sounds which satisfied him that the call was in the little closet behind it Iheijtlung now came together in his mind, he climbed up to Lady Aictiua's late sitting room, thence descended, for the third time that night, to the old oak door, and entered the little chamber, and, hastening to the further end, and his ear against the wall Plainly enough he heal el sounds such sounds as he had before heard from the mouth of the di cam walking rather than sleep walking call He was moaning, and calling in a low voice of entreaty after someone whose name never grow audible to the listener on the other side of the vi ill "Ah!' thought Donal, who would find it hard to believe in learning and haunting ghosts, who had once seen this poor man going about the house like Lady M icbeth. posse seel hythe seven demons of his own evil ridiculed bleeds, and without hope of relief in Heaven only in the grave, not much in that How easily I could punish him now with a light rug blast of hellish tenor ! it was but thought it did not even amount to a tennis tion, for Donal knew he had bought Vengeance belongs to the Loi el, who alone knows what use to make of it I do not myself believe that mere punishment exists anywhere in the economy of the Highest I think more punishment a human idea not a divine one But the consuming ino is more terrible to the evil door than any idea of punishment invented by the most notions of human imaginations punishment it is, though not more punishment, which is a thing not of creation but of destruction it is a power of God and for his electric As love is Goal is being mil a creative energy in one, so the guns of God are to the decorating of the things his love has made and sm his unmade He heard the le in hands of the call it the ends of his long units, go snooping slowly over the wall, he had seen the thing, else he would not have a recognised the sounds, and he heard him utter ing still, but much too low for him to distinguish the words, by this time Denis was so convinced that he had to do with a light elastic oils and unprincipled man, that he would have had little scruple in listening if he could have heard every vi our, men letting what knowledge of him come that might come It is only Righteousness that has a right to hockey, and does not want it, Lui has no right to secrecy, done intensely ebenes it, and wages at being formed for it for, when its bleeds come to the light, even Lv it has i righteousness enough left to be ashamed of some of them But he could not remain there longer, he felt so sick of the whole thing, and turned away at length hastily But forgetting the one beat, and carrying his light too much mementos him to see it, became against it and knocked it over, not without noise Aloud cry from the other side of the wall told the dismay he had caused It was followed by a stillness, and then a moaning As soon as he was out, and had replaced the obstruction of the entrance, he went to find Simmons, and sent him to look after his master Homing nothing after wards of the atlantic did not doubt that the victim of his awkwardness put the whole thing down, if indeed he knew anything of it the next day, to the ming ling of imagination with fact in the manner he was so accustomed to, disabling him by its verisimilitude from distinguishing between the one and the other, or caring to do so [10 nfc, CONTINUED ]
