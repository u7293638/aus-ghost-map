LkKE View South.— Aa-nut 2S:— Have struck lode material, through which a vein some 12 in. -viOe ruoj, having :v clear Jeavago and beiog well defined. Tbi* vein was first encountered on vouch nut corner of th* shaft, bavin*- a alight underlay to the west ; when tint tuei with vein w*» batsuue 3 iu. wide, and now fully U to 14 in. in widUi. From iu present -slight underlay to west, for whole strata bere is almost vertical, this vein will shortly dip out of shaft, but after carefully examining ej»tern wall im of opinion that another lenze or vein will -hortlv be encountered. Cousider this strike one of most important ever made in this mine ; clearly demonstrates face that true sulphide belt or zono dow been entered, impossible to break down rich poition ot l»de by itself, and am therefore now tiavius ore picked -ver on surface by two boys with a view to has;-iiig richest portion, llava every reason to think th;u when open out on 3U0-ft. level tbali hare not only a well-dcnned ore body, bus also »n« carry ins very considerably increased values. No clfort being spared to attain depth as quickly as pusdible, and only very best, practical miners obtain pibJe are now engaged sinking, and no change in character of lode, however slight, is passed through witnoiit being immediately noted and a proper ex-iiflinatiun made, of name. In view of important strike aud conditions under which same encoun tered c .nuidvred it advuabl* to immediately restart ilrivio; oC east crosscut from south drive on SUO-fc. level, with a view to moving this portiomof mine, fully believinj; that shall encounter eastern leg of Drc baUy u|x-a which are no* driving. Ground at pro-ent most nnkindly appearance, is khort and exceptionally hard, but in suite of all disadvantages now being encountered intend to run this crosscut for at least another 15 to 20 ft. In order, however, to continue this work without having to increase number of men at present employed undercround, liavo for tim-i bcinc stopped tbe north drivo on Su-J-f t. level, being now within 5 ft. of our northern boundary. In south drive on this level lode con tinues irregular both as to size, trend, character, uul v-ilne, whole point in*- to fact that even at our present depth lodo is not in settled country. In N'o. Swinz* have stopped sinkioj- at a. depth of W ft.; lode underlying strongly to west. Cost linkin*-, owing to heavy inro-th of water, not JnJy impsdiu-; our progress, but making same rery co-ily, an-l have restarted our No. 3 west :nmcut with a view of rnnning under winze, thereby saving cost of hauling water up by hand labour from bottom of winze to 145-fU leveL In this CTossct hire met occasional i-eams and [Utchas of sulphides, indicating approach to a lode. In N--. 4 nhait continue to meet with frequent rhunj-es in strata, mullocky decomposed country ?omi-i** in with silieious threads and seam* tmvtrs in-; throushout. At present there is every indica tion pointing to a decided change and important FKmibilitirs. Snrface Improvements.— In view of important chance made in ori-rinal plan of having -aly our new lObead battery to addition of another L0 head, and Mr. Brookman's request that no time -bou!d be lost in baring whole ?reeled and in running order, have more than doubled up number if wen employed on tliii work. At new orisinal IU head have mortar blocks and mortars in place, ind same securely boltsd. Caic-»baf t with cams itted is in position, steins with tappiU and ;ut.les are in position and truly lined. Boilers are jricked in, aad flues and chimney base all but com rieted. Boiler fixing*, itc, are fitted, and whole lattery of the«e boiler* ready to have necessary steam-pipes fitted. With new ten-bead have nortar-block foundations already dij, and am now jutting iu necessary bed of concrete. Various loon for pans, frue-vanners. 4c, are being cut, ?.ud are now well in hand. Wooden horses, frames, fcc, are well in hand, and will ba raised to position lext week. Are doing our utmost to ha**e- whole ij head of stamps ready to run within seven -reeks.

No. 1 shaft sunk to 73ft. Have just re-statte-l this work, and shall push same Tvith the utmost rapidity. Bo.n.me CHARLiE.-Fortnight. September S5:— Drive south of winze extended to 40 ft.
