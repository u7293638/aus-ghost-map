A Ghoul. At the Thames Court on Friday March 8th, a man informed the magis- trate that the wife of his lodger died recently from tumour. Pending burial the body rcmained in the house. A doctor from the hospital sent word that he would like a gentleman to view the body. Applicant had no objection. After the gentleman had been in the room a quarter of an hour, he looked through the glass door, and saw him scooping out liquid from the inside of the body. The dead woman's son also saw the gentleman tear out his mother's heart. Applicant wanted to know what action he could take for such an outrage in his parlour. Mr Dickinson was afraid that what had occurred was not actionable, as applicant could not show any damage. Applicant: No damage! Why, I have not slept since Wednesday, and shall have to leave my house. If I stopped there I should always be thinking ghosts were coming after me.
