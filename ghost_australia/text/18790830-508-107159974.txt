Good-Night God keep yon safe, my little love, All thro* the night: Beet oloee in His eaciroling arms Until the Tight. ' My heart is with you as I kneel to pray ; Good-night! God kaep yon in His care alway. Thick shadows creep like silent ghosts j About my head; I lose myself in tender dreams, While overhead The moon comes stealing thro' the window-bars, A silver sickle gleaming 'mid the Btars. For tho' I am far away, Feel safe and strong To trust yon thos, dear love— and yet— The Bight is long — I say with sobbing heart the old fond prayer, Good-nig-ht! Sweet dreams 1 God keep you every where! ' Maet H. Hiqham.
