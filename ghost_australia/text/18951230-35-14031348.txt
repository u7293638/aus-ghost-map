makes its appearance in Australia. Apparently a motor for road and street vehicles has at last been found which does not ruin the possessor by expenses or overwhelm his senses with the odour of oil. A carriage which has a dull-looking box of machinery in front instead of shafts with a sprightly horse in them may not be a very picturesque turnout, or add to the animation of the street traffic But it seems that a machine has at length been devised which, according to the inventors, will enable people to dispense in con- siderable measure with tho use of horses. This latest addition to our methods of conveyance we owe to the French. Steam, electricity, petroleum, and various oils have often been tried as the motive powers of road traction, but until recently nobody succeeded in turning out a carriage which had any chance of becoming popular. A few months ago, however, a race was arranged for automatic road carriages between Paris and Bordeaux, and after this novel contest the petroleum motors, which travelled at the respectable rate of 10 miles an hour. This aroused attention across the Channel, and an exhibition of horseless vehicles was held in the west of England. As a natural consequence, one or two of them have been seen in ordinary use. It is claimed for them that they are clean and comfortable and easily handled, that their maintenance is inex- pensive compared with the keep of horses, and that thoy havo othoi ndt antagos m thoir
