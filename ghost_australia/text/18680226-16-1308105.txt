VISIT OF THE PRINCE. At 6 o'clock yesterday morning two guns from the Observatory awoke our citizens to the fact that the Challenger, H. M. S. S. , with His Royal Highness Prince Alfred on board, was at anchor in Brisbane Roads. About an hour later the Kate, steamer, with His Excellency the Acting-Governor and the members of the Ministry, started down the river to receive His Royal Highness and bring him to town. She was soon after followed by the Emu and other steamers intended to escort the Kate up the river. Unfortunately none of the vessels had many passengers, either because of the early hour of starting, or that the desire was more generally felt to see the landing in Brisbane and the procession to Government House. Going down the river nothing noteworthy occurred. On arriving in the bay, the Challenger was observed dressed from stem to taffrail with flags, the Royal Standard flying at the main. At this time there was a fresh southerly breeze blowing, which caused a considerable swell. This being the case, the Platypus, s.s., signalled the Kate, and told her not to go alongside the man of war. Accord- ingly the Kate stopped her engine as soon as she got near enough, while the Ipswich, Mary, and Emu came close up to her. At the same time His Royal Highness left the Challenger in the ship's gig, accompanied by Commodore Lambert and Messrs. Brierly and Haig, and went on board the Kate. Directly the Prince got on board, tho royal standard was hoisted at the Kate's mainmast. On board the Challenger the men, who had been standing ready in the tops, lay out and manned the yards, while the guns thundered forth a royal salute. The Kate then turned ahead, followed by the Emu, Mary, and Ipswich, passed round the Challenger's bows and stood for the bar. The Emu was then in her position on the Kate's port quarter, the Mary on the other quarter, and the Ipswich bringing up the rear. When about half way to the bar, the Mary was sent back with a message, and the Ipswich took her place. The escort was thus reduced to the two vessels. The Brisbane and Emma had also gone down to the bay with the view of forming part of the escort, but they went so far away in the direc- tion of Humpy Bong that they were unable to take their places in the procession as at first intended. When the boats neared the beacons on the bar they were joined by the Nowra, s., but after a time she dropped astern, and no more was seen of her. The ships in the Bay displayed all their bunting, and those nearest the Challenger - the Flying Cloud and Southern Empire - fired guns as the Kate passed them, and, indeed, until the reports were no longer audible. Tho Proserpine, pohce hulk, was gaily dressed with flags, and as the steamers passed she saluted by dipping her ensign. So the three vessels passed on their way to town; the river looked its best. Being about high water, the unpleasant looking mud flats, which are exposed at low tide, were covered, and the mangroves fringed the water. The sun was brightly shining overhead, and owing to the late rains all vegetation looked vividly green and healthy. At Lytton the flags on the wharf and boat- shed were dipped as the steamers went by. About a mile further up the nver the Black Diamond met the flotilla, and giving hearty cheers took her position astern between the Emu and Ipswich. The pace, however, was too great for her, and she was left behind in the next reach. A few flags were seen here and there, but neither man, woman or child between Lytton and the Hamilton. The whole of the dwellers on the river banks had apparently left then homes to take care of themselves while they enjoyed their holiday in town. At the Hamilton a huge number of ladies on horseback were seen, who, immediately on making out the Kate, galloped off towards town, apparently with the view of announcing for a certainty the welcome intelligence that the Prince was on his way up to Brisbane. On the green bank just below Breakfast Creek a detachment of the Volunteer Artillery had placed three of their field pieces in position, and as the Kate approached commenced firing a salute. On seeing this the boats slackened speed, and finally stopped altogether, until the salute was finished. It was fired in good time, and as soon as it was finished the guns were lumbered up, and the detachment started for town at a rattling pace. Mr Harris' yacht, the Hamlet's Ghost, was at anchor off Newstead, and presented a veiy gay appeal ance, docked out as she was with innumerable flags On her sido a cloth had been fixed, on which were tho xx oída, "Wolcomo to tho Sailor Princo," woikcd in flowcia She, too, tried to do fuither honor to the Punce by dipping hoi onsign mid firing a salute Eroni Breakfast Cicek thero weie no moio demonstrations until tho arrival m town, though hero and there thero xvoio gioups of pnoplo standing on the bank, xvho waved hundkoiohiofs lustily as tho steamcia passed Whilo passing Andorson'a slip tho Ipswich fell astern of the Emu, ao that tho three vessols foi mod a line, tho Kato, of courso, leading The town presented a very animated and foBtiv 0 nppcaranco as the ateamora rounded Knngai00 Point Tho AA itch of tho Tees, bnrque, the steamora Quconaland Ola renee, Williams, and Leichhardt, weio all lying m the stream, at some distance apait, in a lino from abreast tho Custom Houso to nbieast of (ho landing stage Besido theso vessels, tho Pearl, suivcying schooner, and ono of the pilot schooners wero lying in the shearn , and all, in common willi tho vessels nt tho wharf, wero i dresaed in holiday attire Tho Kate passed in side of Ibis hue of vesaola direct to tho stago, where sho mudo fast Tho Emu steamed up on the outside or Kangaroo Point side of the Btoamera, and, lound tho uppeimost, »topped oppoaito tlio landing atage, whilo tho Ipswioh w ent along tho A S N Co 'a wharf. THE LANDING Eurly m the morning tho streets were thronged with crowds of people, waiting xvith impationco foi tho firing of tho threo guns which waa to bo the signal that the Kato, with His Royal High ness tho Duko of Edinburgh on board, waa crosamg the bar Shortly after 10 o'clock tho welcomo argnal was given, and numhera of per sons who before purposelessly wandering about tho streets, bogan to wend then xvay towards tho common centro of attraction-tho landing place at the Botamoal Gardens The convcm enco of making the official cully early in the day, inBtead of on the previous evening, when everything would have beeu bustle and confu sion, was very npparent Tho people were ablo to take up positions from which they could command good view s of all that might occur during the course of tho proceedings , and tho procession could bo organised and other ar rangements efliciently carried out, without that confusion, discomfort, and waste of time that must othorwise hove occurred Iho apot selected by the Government us that on which the Prince should uiako Ina oftl cial landing, was admirably suited for the oica 81011, and m everyway proforablo to the one higher up the river, wheio it xvaa at first supposed that tho disembarkation would take place It xxas not only far moto easy of access fi om the streets, but it could bo approached bv large numbora of pooploxxithout deetroyiug or in any xvay injuring the Botanical Grardens, which could not havo been avoided had the people been admitted indiscriminately into the grounds, for in their eagerness to wit ness all the evints connected with tho Princo's landing, it ia moro than possible that tho plants and Bhruba would havo been very roughly treated In addition to tin«, proces«iom«ti could a=aemblo in tho Park, form in order, and take up their proper positions without tho lea«t trouble For the greater facihtv of disembarkation from tho Kate, two punts wore moored some little distance out into the rivor, to tho left of the Alice Btreot ferry, and wore connected with the shore by means of a commodious landing stace. Thocontio of tlio staging wa3 cat petted ÉU aetly in ft out of tho staging a largo triumphal arch was elected It was designed by Mr liffiu, tho Colonial Architect, in imitation of the arch of Sontimus SoveruB, at Rome It was not ro mmkable for tho ina»sivouesa of its struc- ture or tho cltganco of its appearance, but it neve! theless looked extremely woll when viewed fiom a distance The arch consists of oue gi and cential opening about twenty six feet vtido, and tuen ty feet high in tho centre, with wing openings about ten feet m height In anticipation of the landing taking place on Monday, as at first arranged", tho arch was decorated on Sunday lust, under thesupenntendencoof Mr Hill,thoOuratorofthe Gardens Many varieties of terns to bo found in the Bombs, and pretty specimens of shrubs and plants indigonous to the colony, were tastefully anaugod about the arch The eflect would have been extiemely pi etty had the landing taken placo on Monday, but in conse- quent of its postponement the plants lost all their fieshness and became dried up and witheied, so that, although this defect was not visible at a distance, yet a closer inspection of tho arch was calculated to create feelings of disappointment On tbo front of the arch, m hugo blue Ietteis, was the inscription-" Wel- come to Queensland," and on the opposito sido the words " Welcome Son of England's groatest Boy al Patron of At ts and Industry God Save tho Queen " Tho central aich was surmounted by u turret, which wus pioicodto as to udniit of tho mseition of a device represent- ing the Roy ni arms, in which wore quin tered the shield nnd crest of His Hoy al llicbncss the Duke of Edinburgh Over tho central arch floated the Boyal standaid, supported by the blue and whito en- signs, and over the wing openings tho union jacks and other colors On either side of the arch lui go coverod gallones, capablo of accom- modating about six hundred persons, had been erected m the foi in of a semi eulo Imme- diately in front of tho mch an"/ galleries venetian masts were put up, from which wore suspended gaily coloicd flags and stiearners On eithoi side of tho venetian masts, about ttvolvo feet fiom the giound, were fixed devices, suppo»ed to lepresect shields and ciosts of His .Lxcellcucy the Governor, the Bishops, the Judges, the Mintsteis, the Pieei dont of tho Council, the Spenkct of tho Assem- bly, and othei gentloinen Above and around these a number of flags woie artanged, so that tlio toni allembie tins extiemely ellcctive When Tievv ed fi om the landing stage the arches presented a very pretty appcaianco, mid we cannot speuk in tains of too much praise of tho unwearied exoitious of the goutlemou who m toicsted themsolves in deeoioting and beautify- ing tho areli aud its belongings Wo must congratulate them on the success that attended their labors, vvhou wo considei the many dtili culties with which they had to contend Shoitly aftci 11 o'clock the ludios and gentle- men, to it horn cards of ent i te to the gullcncä and onolosuie witina the ti oh had boon issued, began to ainve, and before long the former wore croivdcd, though not lneonvonientlv so, with elegantly attired ladies It was not found ne cessaiy to enfoicc the strict obscivance of the thoughtful suggestion of the Hon the Colonial lreasurei, *vbo apparently entertained some doubts rcspeotiug tho politeness of tbo gentle mon of Queensland, tv lieu ho was led to expre»s a hope thut "gcntltmcn" would not inconve- niente* oioiid tlio galleries, which was intended moio especially for the uso of the fairer sex.

line of the procession preparatory to its starting Of course thero was a considerable amount of crushing immediately opposite His Royal Highness' camoge, and as faithful chro melera of the proceedings we ore compelled to ata, c that this was mostly caused by the ladies, moro especially the youngest and prettiest They pushed, begged, coaxed, »nd tried all they could to get to the front-and did get there, the gentlemen, with Borne few exceptions, giv- ing place to them Nothing approsehing cithei disturbance or confusion occurred m the crowd, indeoa, it was without exception the moBt quiet, orderly, and undemonstrative crowd we ever chanced to be among The peo pie were anxious to see tho Pnnoe, did see him, and from the ¡otto toic observations heard on all aides they were very pleased with him as in deed thev could hardly fail to be A high bom, rather good looking, amiable, affable gentlemen of twenty two or twenty three years of age is, under olmost any circumstances, safe to be a favoute with any crowd which could bo col lected on English ground and when the young gentleman happens to be a Prince of the Blood Roval of England-the ion of the most popular sovereign who has occupied the throne since the davs of Good Queen Besa-of course the disposition to regard him favorably is infinitely increased That the people who met His Royal Highness yesterday m Brisbane did so regard him there is not the slightest reason for doubt ing They manifested it by their good order, respectful demeanor-by tlio looks of their »aces even-but they did not manifest it in the manner most usual with a British crowd, namely, in hearty bursts of cheers Thero wa« m fact very httlo cheering during any part of the procoasion Now and again there would be »n attempt, and some few persons might bo ?een to exert themselves to the utmo»t, but in no case was it that thoroughly hearty, vigorous, deep toned, and unanimous ehout, which is so characteristic of tho truo British cheer Bmbano

The bunya bunya and other trees were all decorated with Chinese lan- terns, and the effect was very agreeable. The fireworks were for the most part of a very ordi- nary character. Not being skilled in the techni- cal terms of the pyrotechnic art we can only say that there were plenty of rlockets, and what boys call fiery snakes, which to the infinite delight of the crowd, young an old, darted hither and thither, and shot out showers of golden drops or brilliant stars of different hues. Some set representation, the Prince of Wales' plume, Punce Alfred's monograms, the Galatea in an engagement with some unseen foe, and some others were good in their way, but not as suc- cessful as could be wished. Most persons seemed rather glad when the display was over, and the assembled crowds joined those travers- in the streets.
