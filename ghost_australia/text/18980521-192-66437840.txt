j" Lines to Lais. I (PER FAVOR OF THE GAZETTE ) I OH, girl 1 whose hand clasped mine last night, Ã¯ Whose eyes are bright and blue I Why DO you ask that I should write I One little rhyme-for you ? I To your sweet self this bard might well i Your many charms rehearse, Yet find it mighty hard to tell The same in decent verse. When red stars burn and pulse above Around the silv'ry moon, Impassioned, glowing words of love Leap from the hps full soon. Or where green willows droop and sway O'er the blue water's brink, A minstrel might have much to say He won't commit to-ink. But now the rain is falling fast, A wet day's sullen gloom Its dull dam-p dreariness has cast About the poet's room. I find a very damaged pen And " copy" paper here, But CAN I sing a love-song when I have not you,-my dear ! " I LOVE^OU, DARLING 1 BEST AND MOST !" See, twice I underline it ; j So there's your verse-but, Cosar's Ghost ! You can't " kid" me te sign it ! I B.(ACHELOR.)
