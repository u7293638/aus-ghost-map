Scene in the Mouse. The scene in the House a I the division was of the most exciting description. The galleries were crowded with expectant visitors, and all were on the tip- toe of excitement. When the divUou-bell raug, the hurried movements of cither party betokened something extra ordinary, and as Mr. Morgan waa wheeled in on his chair and took his place on the Govern ment benches, the excitement hccame intense; but the Opposition had been up to the mark, and the opening of a sidedoor revealed Messrs. \ Fcttigrew and O'SuUivan, who immediately | walked across to the Opposition benches. It was clear that every nerve had been strained j bv both parties, the only member abseut being i Mr. llaly. Contrary to expectations, Mr. Kidgell was iu the House and voted with the i Government; while Mr. Pcrsse, who has hitherto sat ou those benches, supported the ! Opposition on the occasion. The closeness of the division was Buch as to afford cause of congratulation to both parties; and cheers j from the Government side were answered by , ironical cheers from the defeated party. The ! galleries quickly cleared after the division.— ; Observer. : fhePatriot remarks, "Whenthedivisionbel rang last night, the Opposition cheered like* mad as poor O'Suliivaii, looking like the ghost of bis former self, walked into the House. At the same moment, almost, Morgan, stretched on a sofa, was carriod into the House. As bis sofa entered the string doors, Palmer angrily exclaimed, "I eoc strangers," but these strangers immediately withdrew, and the sick man was earned forward by the mes sengers of the house, and two of the Ministers. Such a division is, we believe, without pre cedent in Australia, and there have been very ftku it few in Kti^l&ad.; "■
