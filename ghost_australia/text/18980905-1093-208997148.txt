DEEAML IASSAGEE, i Gutter Attacked, Captain and Four Mies A CaimiM Feast, Sydney, September 4. Another story of- the greater portion ot a ship's crew being massacred .was brought to Sydney yesterday by the steamer Moresby, which arrived from New Guinea and island ports. About a month ago a 16-ton cutter, the Sea Ghost, was dis patched by the owner, Mr. Tindall, of Shortland Island, on a trading cruise in the Solomon Group. The cutter was under the command of . Captain Colohorn and flew the German flag. When approaching the island of Nusa, near Bogaiuville, the captain was in the rigging on the look out for reefs, and he did not notice that the natives who had put off in canoes as usual, had clambered on board in large numbers. Captain Colohorn was descending the rigging when the natives made an attack. He was surprised and being unarmed was soon butihered. Four of the native crew made a desperate 'fight, but the odds against them were great and they were overcome. The other two na tives of tne crew were taken prisoners, but afterwards managed to escape. Meanwhile the Sea Ghost had been run ashore, and having been looted of everything valuable was subsequently destroyed. The captain's body was thrown overboard, but the re mains of the four murdered natives were taken to a village for a cannibalistic feast. The German warship Falke will in due course proceed to the islands to punish the natives.
