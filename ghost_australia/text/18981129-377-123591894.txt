THE NORTH IPSWICH "SPOOK" Great consternation mingled with much fear (writes a correspondent) prevails amongst the residents of Pine-street, North Ipswich. It is said that about midnight-sometimes before a "ghost" comes along Pinestreet frightening people as it wends its way to the " four gates paddock," where it rests awhile and goes down Down-street towards the railway gate. Probably it would like to pay the cleaners a visit, but thinks it might get "a hiding." Various rumours are about concerning this apparition. One being that it ran a woman along Pine- street to her house frightening her to such an extent that she has not yet recovered. Then a lad about 15 came running in one night to his father and mother who saw some white object chasing the boy. The lad said it was a ghost (?). A man living in Pine-street was coming home after leaving the late train the other night and met "Mr Spook" at the railway gate opposite Oldham's, and evidently wished to give it a wide birth, for, he said, which ever way he turned the objurgated thing was dancing in front of him. So great is the fear which has taken hold of the female residents in this locality that they will not venture out of their houses after dark. The bachelors' club very kindly came to the rescue on Saturday night. Many of them waited up pretty late to investigate this unearthly being, but were unsuccessful. Perhaps "the Spook" got wind of the insult they wished to offer, and would not appear. Whoever this per- son is, it would just be as well for him to discontinue his nightly perambulations, or else some of the residents will not be respon- sible for what they do. The police have been on the watch, but he manages to evade them, much to his own advantage. Any one guilty of such an action deserves the full extremity the law can give. His action is a mean, cowardly one, to say the least of it, and the residents most earnest desire is that he may be caught.
