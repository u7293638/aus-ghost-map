A CHARITY FESTIVAL. The Charity Festival, the proceeds of which are to be divided between the Dorcas Society, the Mothers' Meeting, the City Mission, and the Nursing Sister Association was continued at cbe Pine-street lecture-hall on Thursday afternoon and evening, and if the appearance oi tUa stalls at clMing lime may be trusted to tell their tale truthfully, business was every thing that could be uesired. Some of the nulls, noticeably ' the sweet stall, were leir, completely divested ot their tempt ing stock, The young ladies who pre sided over these stalls are to be connra taiaced upon their success. In tide room* wore to be seen and heaid .Edison's phonograph, shown by Mr. Lavmgton Bonythou, and *'a ghost," which at given times was to lie seen oa its mystic perambulation. In the evening an excellent programme of character songs, choruses, and recitations was presented by Air. and Mrs. W. G. Ham mond, the Misses Booython and friends. The programme opened with the quaint ballad ! with its chorus and tableaux "five o'clock tea," tfu^soto of which was sweetly sung by Miss Bony tbon. The droning in t c tableaux was pretty and appropriate, and the number was much appreciated. Mrs. HamoionJ then gave the recitation " CrumU or' comfort" witb appropriate humor and zest, Air. HainmoaJ's character song "Medicine Jack" was received with delight, and had to be repeated. Miss Bonv:'.ioa was agaia successful in ! her recitation ?'Tommy abroad," and | Mrs. Hamuwnd threw a (Treat amount of life into "Gay Tom Tit." A reci tation by AlUs K. Bonython met with tho appreciation it deserved, and a capital even linjf's entertainment concluded with Mrs. I llammoud rendering in character or "Caller 1 herein'," witb .t pretty chorus of equally pretty fishwives. The management are to be con gratulated upon the success of the festival, i and without doubt t:.ey win tie able to bind j over a substantial sum to each of the institu tions to bt> assisted.
