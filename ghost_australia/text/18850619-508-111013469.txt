Fight in Woolloomooloo^ WHEEE AEE THE POLICE ? A disgraceful scene occurred in Dowline-streeftc Woolloomooloo, on Sunday afternoon. A jiumbeS ot larriins gathered, and two of them fought for! more than three-quarters of an hour without any) interruption. At the end of that time they adjourned to some other part of the district. The same thing1 frequently occurs, much to the annoyance of the' «BiuwMB. x&e; Jamkins congregate at the corners; ii Ae streets '! the locality, and are a nuisance to! all the respectable residents. It is time some addi«: tional policemen were stationed in the district in question, so as to put a stop to the nuisance. One ia' sometimes seen about there, but like Haznlet'a ghost ne soon disappears. Perhaps if some plain clothes constables were to visit the district on Sunday aft«- noons, and also on weekday evenings, they might catch some of the offenders.
