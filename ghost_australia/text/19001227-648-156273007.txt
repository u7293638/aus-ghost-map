Local Brevities. ———♦——— The programme of Goolma Jockey Club races, to be held on Jan. 18, appears in this issue. * * * The Salvation Army were about with their Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. * * * Mr. Richard Rouse, of Gunta- wang, has returned home, after a most pleasant trip to Ceylon. * * * Mr. Wilkinson left for Rylstone last night to adjudicate in the alleged assault case in which a pub- lic official is concerned. * * * A united Watch-night Service will be held in the Presbyterian Church on New Year's eve, com- mencing at 10.45. * * * Messrs. John Newman and Tom Wilton are taking their milk to McDonald's Creek butter factory during the summer months. * * * Budgee Budgee races and the cricket match, Town v. Visitors, were the only Boxing Day at- tractions around Mudgee. * * * Mr. E. J. Gorman has passed the exam, for a provisional school, and is waiting for an appointment, which he naturally expects will be somewhere in the back blocks. * * * Nearly 2300 bales of wool have up to the present been despatched from Mudgee station during this season. Of course a number of late clips have yet to come in. * * * Mr. H. C. White, of Havilah, has a number of Welsh ponies just landed from Sydney. They are in quarantine in Sydney for a certain number of days. * * * When Cudgegong Council remove the gravel off Bombira lane cul- verts there will be a succession of miniature gullies, which will make travelling over the road the reverse of pleasant. * * * We have received the Christmas number of the Australian Photo- graphic. Review, which is a very creditable production and is worthy of presentation by local amateur artists. * * * Some of the street gas burners require renewing. The dim light from one of them prompted the re- mark from a visitor that he was always under the impression that tallow dips were out of use. * * * The jury returned an open ver- dict at the inquest on the recent fire at Waverley Station. The con- flagration was supposed to have been the work of an incendiary, but the jury did not see sufficient in the evidence to incriminate any one. * * * A travelling company of thea- tricals hired the Town Hall for a variety entertainment on Saturday night last, and failing to get an audience they took to the streets and gave an open air entertainment, of course sending round the hat for the stray " thrum." * * * Messrs. Collyer and Carmichael have completed the stand for the fire bell, and a most substantial structure it is. The bell, at its elevation of between 40ft. and 50ft., should, if rung in the night, disturb the rest of the soundest-sleeping fireman. * * * We would remind certain sports- men (?) that the shooting season for game in this district does not open until the 1st February, 1901. The duck-shooting season opened in Wagga the other day, and a party of sports, who did not journey more than a few miles from the town, bagged no less than 1000 wild ducks. XXXXXXXX ——————————————— There has been the usual Christmas rush of Indian hawkers to town, and a temporary township has been formed on the river bank. * * * Mr. Maurice Vale describes this Christmas from a business point of view as the best he has had for three years. * * * Sir W. J. Lyne's failure to form a Federal Ministry was due to the jealousy and cliquism of disap- pointed politicians. * * * A general holiday very seldom passes by without some more or less serious accident to sadden the event. In Mudgee this Christmas we have had two fatalities. * * * Messrs. T. J. Lovejoy (Council clerk) and J. Stapleton (I.O.N.) have been granted leave of absence to visit the Commonwealth celebrations. * * * Mudgee half-squadron of the First Australian Horse are to meet at the railway station at a quarter to four on Sunday morning for the purpose of trucking horses. * * * Wheat harvesting in the district has so far been carried out under most favorable conditions, and most of the crops have been stacked without hinderance by the weather. * * * The Budgee Race Club's meeting, on Boxing Day, attracted a big crowd, but the day's pleasure was quite spoiled by the accident which caused Bernie Walsh to lose his life. * * * We warn the Councils that unless immediate attention is paid to the planking on Holyoak bridge there will be a serious accident. It is disgraceful that such a state of affairs should exist in Mudgee. * * * There will be no issue of any of the local papers during next week. Half of Mudgee will be away at the Commonwealth ceremonies, and why not the printers' devil. * * * The recently laid blue metal in Church-street requires a few loads of blinding. It is shirked by the traffic and as a result the road on either side is cutting up badly. * * * In his young days the veteran John Bax was the champion buck- jumping rider of the district. He is now 80 years of age, and the other day he mounted a buck-jumper, but got landed though not hurt. * * * We hear that Mrs. George Cross- ing has been confined to her room as the result of the burning injuries she received when assisting to ex- tinguish the fire in the clothing of the late Miss Lane. * * * Mr. J. Kennedy, proprietor of the Bow Hotel, near Merriwa, announces there will be a day's racing on New Years Day, when the prize money will amount to £20. * * * The excursion trains which have arrived in Mudgee have not had the usual big crowd of holiday seekers abroad, in fact many of the compartments were half empty. The country will have very little charm for the Sydneyites during the Com- monwealth flare up. * * * Several business men who thought that the telephone would not be of much use to them have quickly become converted to the more progressive view, and the list of subscribers is growing apace. Those who wish to be connected with the exchange should give immediate notice. * * * In spite of municipal promises the Cassilis road is still in the same disgraceful state. It is becoming an open question as to whether it would not be far better to abolish the council and appoint a level- headed man as commissioner. For the last 18 months the roads all over the municipality have been getting worse and worse. ——————————————— The telephone exchange was officially opened on Christmas eve. * * * Mudgee band will go to Sydney 22 strong. * * * Mr. Hilton conducted a most successful sale at Biraganbil last week. * * * A big storm passed over the Meroo side early on Saturday morning. * * * Mr. John Newman has been elected a director of the Mudgee Dairy Company. * * * Christmas Eve in Mudgee passed off quietly. There was no rowdy- ism, and everybody seemed to make up their minds to have a good time of it. * * * Mr. Tweedie, who is to succeed Mr. Sams at Home Rule Public School, is an ex-clergyman, and his wife is said to be a Mudgee district lady. * * * About 300 passengers left by special trains before Christmas. The ordinary train every night also carried more than the usual com- pliment of passengers. * * * There was a record day at the Lewis-street market on Saturday last, and Auctioneer Wells could not find time to have dinner until 5 o'clock. * * * The many friends of Mr. J. Dagger, of Tambaroora, will be extremely sorry to hear of his death last week. He is one of the old identities of the old field. For many years he has successfully con- ducted an hotel trade. * * * The " Guardian " office will be closed from Saturday, Dec. 29, to Saturday, Jan. 5. This is to allow our staff to participate in the Com- monwealth holiday. * * * A special cheap train leaves Mudgee on Saturday morning at a quarter past seven, and another on Sunday evening at a quarter to six. A special train leaves at 4 o'clock on Sunday morning convey- ing the military bodies. * * * Mr. W. Schlachter always gives the postman and the news boy a Christmas box. Generations of printers' devils have reason to re- member his generosity in this re- gard. * * * Private reports from Sydney are to the effect that already the metropolis is fairly teeming with visitors, and that at times people are compelled to elbow their way through the crowded streets. * * * A couple of narrow escapes from disastrous bush fires in this dis- trict are reported. In one case on the Cassilis road the flames were within a few yards of a large wheat paddock, when it was beaten back by a party of about thirty men, women and children. * * * The cheap-jack take-down who victimised a number of Mudgeeites on Saturday night last, is said to have also made a good haul at Rylstone, where he easily pocketed between £15 and £20, including a fiver from a prominent townsman. * * * The postal conference has decided that as soon as the post offices are taken over by the Commonwealth their should be a charge of ½d on the postage of every newspaper. At present New South Wales is the only State where there is free postage on newspapers. * * * The two spielers who took down a Mudgee crowd for about £20 on Saturday night did not turn up in Market-street at 8 p.m. to give those who entrusted them with their cash, the promised sudden surprise. There were plenty of people who believed they would keep their word. ——————————————— Mudgee Cadets' names do not appear among the successful com- petitors at the rifle matches. * * * A small fly, similar to that which gets in the wheat, is doing a lot of damage among the fruit crops. Peaches, especially, are affected. * * * Mudgee band played at the Exchange Corner on Christmas Eve, and proved a source of enjoyment to numbers. * * * Fulminate, who won the Villiers Stakes in Sydney on Boxing Day, is trained by Gough, and is looked after by Chris Jeremey. * * * In all directions Mudgee people are to be found in Sydney. On Christmas Eve George-street was lined with them. * * * The funeral of the late Miss Lane, the victim of the terrible burning fatality, took place at nine o'clock on the morning of Christmas day. * * * The two special trains from Sydney during the holidays did not bring more than fifty passengers, all told. Cityites do not care about missing the big Common- wealth show. * * * We understand that Dr. Lips- comb is leaving Mudgee shortly, and that his practice will be carried on by Dr. Walton, who was acting locum tenems for Dr. Nickoll a year or two ago. * * * George A. Blumer, son of the head master of the Mudgee superior public school, has been successful in capturing one of the Government scholarships at the Sydney High School. We congratulate the lad and his parents. * * * Some very special lines of French kid gloves, imported direct from the manufacturers, are now being shown by Messrs. T. H. Marks and Co. A full price list will appear in the first issue of the new year. * * * Mr. Sams, schoolmaster at Home Rule, who goes to Tweed Heads, is to be presented with a parting souvenir this evening. Mr. Sams has made himself very popular during his stay in Home Rule. * * * Mr. E. Clarke appeared for the accused in the Rylstone alleged assault case, while Mr. Davidson is prosecuting. The case has caused considerable excitement in Ryl- stone. * * * In the beginning of the New Year tenders will be called for the additions to the Mudgee Post and Telegraph Offices. When finished the building will be a very fine one. * * * Mr. Benjamin Carver, of Hill End, has been appointed miners' representative at the Commonwealth celebrations in Sydney next week. Mr. Carver is one of the old Hill End identities. * * * Constable " Mick " Ford has again joined the foot police, and is doing duty at Sydney. After the New Year Constable Dolman will also re-join the mounted police. * * * Constables. Dunlop, Prowse and and McNamara went to Bathurst by Wednesday night's train. From there they will go to Sydney with the whole of the foot police from the Western district. * * * The men who worked at Havilah shed this year say that the contract system of shearing is most advan- tageous to the shearer. One shearer says he would like to see the system more generally in use. * * * There should be a deputy coroner in Mudgee who could empanel a jury in the absence of the police magistrate. Mr. George Stewart, J.P., was acting coroner for a time, and his appointment as deputy would have given general satisfaction. ——————————————— Dale's Creek has been appointed a polling place in the electoral dis- trict of Rylstone. * * * Races were held at Cudgegong on Boxing Day, and passed off most satisfactorily. * * * We are sorry to hear that Mr. J. C. Gunnell has been confined to his room for some days past from illness. * * * We understand that the tender of a man from outside the district has been accepted for boring operations at Home Rule. * * * A number of Mudgee folk were present at the Randwick races on Boxing Day, and came away a long way behind it. * * * Mr. Sid. Bentzen has been ap- pointed to the managership of the Commercial Bank at Bourke. He is an excellent officer. * * * Mr. George Campbell, of Ura- wilkie station, came down to spend his Christmas in Mudgee. He looks well and hearty. * * * The travelling furniture company, who did good business during their stay in Mudgee, have gone to Gul gong. * * * Mudgee volunteers go to the Commonwealth functions by special train, which leaves at 4 o'clock on Sunday, the 30th. * * * One of the man-o-warsmen from H.M.S. Katoomba is spending a few days with some friends in Mudgee. * * * Mr. George Coleman, J.P., another of our old Mudgee boys has been appointed deputy coroner for Wagga Wagga. George now does the leading solicitor's practice. * * * McDonald's Creek bridge construction which is all but finished is at a stand still for want of the last load of planking, which some difficulty is found in obtaining. * * * Two and a half tons of stone from Ackerman's claim at Hill End, put through Carver's battery, gave forth a nice little Christmas cake of thirty ounces of gold. * * * A horse yielded up the ghost in the corporation sale yards last week. Being dead meat it failed to find an owner, and the Council laborers had to perform the funeral obsequies. * * * Another compliment to our old friend Superintendent Garvin. He has been placed in command of the country mounted police who are now in Sydney for the Common- wealth celebrations. * * * Visitors to the Commonwealth Celebrations are advised not to have a prominent display of Jewellery about their person. It may prove temptation to weak mortals of the light-fingered kind of steal. * * * Trooper G. H. F. Cox arrived in Mudgee last week, and after spending a few days at Burrundulla went to the mountains for the Xmas. In a week or two he will contribute a few articles to the " Guardian " on Transvaal matters. * * * Stationmaster Eagleson informed us that he will have sufficient carriages at his command on Saturday and Sunday next to carry a thousand people, so that, he says, there need not be much fear of anybody being left behind for want of room. * * * Stationmaster Eagleson has managed affairs at Mudgee station during the great rush of traffic in a praiseworthy manner. Every special was dispatched in good time and without the slightest confusion. Subordinate officers, Porter Quince and Operator O'Brien worked like trojans, and rendered every assistance to the feminine and the aged. .
