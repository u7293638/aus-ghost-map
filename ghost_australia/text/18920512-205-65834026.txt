Carlo and Christian .Olson, farmers, of: Granite Falls, of the 'remarkahbl results of a striuol of lightning .which struck the prairie about a mile and a half from Olson's house. It racurred in .lune ,last during a heavy storm. They say it made a holo in the ground between five and six feet deep, and from this hole there extend six trenches two feet deep, branching off in different directions, and "extending for'a,dintance of from six to eight -od. And what was very singular, inot a particle of the sod and dirt thrown front the hole and treneaes was to be son, except now and then a large piece of sad tIrwnty or thirty rods away. Mr. Olion says that by uri?sal measurement the ditehes ploughed out by the lightning from where it struek were allont an equal distance apart; four of them were of 'the same length, and the other two six feet shborter; The report is said to have been as terrible as if an explosion had occurred. A lady sitting at a wiridow inl a house a mile avray'seneibly felt the shock; two men rwetr nintinji outside another huese a mile away tromn the scene, and so forcibly did they fede 'it that they immediately jui:ped to their feet and went into the house woithout sprskiuig. .MDr. C.'A.
