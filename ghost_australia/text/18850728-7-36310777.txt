SPORTING. Negotiations between the promoters of the new racing club and Messrs. Blackler and Ferry are still pending. and from the informa-<*> tion we have received it appears as though the lessees of tiie Old Course are becoming unneces sarily obstrnctive-*. We believe tfae other side have yielded to tfae extent of a thousand Brands more than their first oiler, and that ladder and Ferry can obtain £6,000, and £1,000 contingent on tfae totali zator being reintroduced. These appear to be fair terms and a liberal offer in these dull times, but tfae Old Course lessees are standing out for £7,000, not having abated anything. Acting in this spirit thajy once before lost the chance of amalgamating, and it seem-i as though they are ajjain likdy to spoil tbeir casase by "going for the ku- tdollar." Messrs. Bladder and Ferry should bear in mind that it is by their own act only that a debt of tin's magni tude is due on the Old Course. They have been the '"finaudal managers" throughout and bave exjiended money in a variety of ways that would not liave been endorsed by a com mittee. When an effort is being made in the interests of sport to re-establish racing on a sound footing here, and when a large amount of capital will have to be raised to purchase both courses and lay down a Plumpton for coursing, surely Messrs. Blacker and Ferry should be* willing to make a little sacrifice and meet the would-be purchasers in sportsmanlike fashion, even if they accept less than thdr own c?*-ti*rnate of tfae value of th<* |iroperty. There is no room for rival dubs here, and tbe only hope of obtaining the use of the totalisator again is by all parties -co-operating in tfae formation of one substantial club. Should these negotiations fall through the lessees of the Old Course will discover tfaat they have alienated tfaemsdves from the sympathy and Rupport of the tow*n-*pe?ple as well as tfae turfites. We have it on the best authority that it is the intention of tne promoters of the new club to hold important meetings on tbe Old Course and to study the wishes of tbe public iu maintaining radng wherever it can be made most popular as well as profitable. Referring to a visit to Cripps Brothers' training establishment, *' Augur, in the Aus tralasian, says:—For action and apjiearance nothing pleaserd me more than the tilly by Countryman or Itichn-.ond from Miss H**slop. She was foaled to the latter"s time, and her wondc-rful girth is so similar to that of the Victorian o\\-champion tfaat I don't think tiiere can be any doubt -rap-ading hear paternity. She inherits his iwwajr, and if ever I saw a filly capable of carrying heavy wdghts and going fast this is the one*. Her breeding is first class, for ln*r dam Miss He-slop is by Costa from Se*renity, by Saunterer from Gratitude, by Newniinster; and the Hon. W. Robinson, of "Sew Zealand, has g-iod cause to remember Gratitude, for she was bis inare wlien he was ?m the l'nplish turf, and by a short head only he was deprived "f tlic pleasure of effecting a great coup in one of the principal autumn liaudiciis <>f the old countiy. Miss H**slop is also the dam of Bis Bis, who was p-is**ss'-d of a most brilliant turn oi n*.x****i, but she lacked the strength of tliis daughter of Rich mond, f.>r whom I prophesy a successful caremr on the* turf 7 provided that sh*> goes through her training without acrid*-nt. Cantering at ha*r side as she trotted in beautiful style round the circle was a full brother t*i Santa Clans, a w.-ll griiwn colt, whose" bay coat shone like satin in tiie sun. He, too, is a nice mover in his slow liacet.: and a neat little tilly by Coiintryman or Kichmond from Annie Finuin is aim ist (-tire to go fast, for her dam is lialf sister to Footstep and Lord Wilt>.n, and full sister to Sandal.

Alluding to the o*>**rations of last w.*ek the Melbourne Leader ?f .Inly -J7> says :—Monday last iva-.i bis day in the betting "ring, settling over the lite Grand Nati"iial ami Wjterlou Cup meeting*- occupyiii£ the whole ?>{ Un' day. Main* of the bookmakers, anxious to hie away t? llemiliquin, got thr"U_*h their settling during the day, ami the eweasion of the genera] tvuder.vout was utilised te execute one* or two important commissions on future events. For the Melbourne Cup the owner of Coronet Fupjurted his horse so firmly as to plac-r the Newmarket H andicap winner at tfae head of the quotations, side by male with Commoticm. wh'-se 1-opulanty with the general public will cause the veteran to carry" a ton of money should he s*?e the jx-.-t. The N*-w Zealand repre sentative, Julv, has also bee?n heavily back-— fexr the Cup, btit straight out b-rrtting on the Derby has only been condacted in fits and bl—rts. The confidence expressed openly by lhinlop's owner in his oil'-, fitness and ability has dispelled the shadow that recently en veloped the son of N-sckeriFgat and Etta, who is as good a favorite as anything, bar the Maribyrnong Plate winner, Newst**aci. A number of wafers, have- been laid on the Caul tidd Cup, for which event the price may lie Suoted -is 1000 t?> 30 <>n th" field, a dozen iffr-rrent horw-s having been backed at this lipira*, including last year's winner. Blink laonuy, Vel-cii*ede, Grace Darling (on th*- htrwigth ,4 the Ghost's running at I'lcmington), St. l_wn*nce. Plausible., and St. John. The Maribyrnong Plate is at prewnt quite a dead letter, and the g*jn<-*nilly popular douhle, Hawke- fbnry Handicap and Metro]>oUtan, hae not yet been o|-aa-at**d upon. During the week a lot of steady preparatory work lias lteen dame ?n tiie training ground, notwithstanding the still heavy state .if tii** poing. The pevtple.ii idol, old Or-mmotion, looks as gay and blooming as his most ardent admirer could wish ; and as the champion is in robuiit health, and is stiU the ixJ-isessor of a set of unblemished understanding*;, there is eve-iy probability of Mr. Dakin t?-ing able to strip bin: em Ute 3rd of November as tit and well as last year, when "he ought to have wou." His stable cominnion, the Hying Fry ing|ian, also looks hearty, but, unlike the* veteran, the little horse is " queer bdow," and may cause his trainer many an anxious hour. No horees at Flemington look better tlian Coronet and Monshee*. who daily attract the favorable notice of Uie early risers; the former is a very glutton for work, evidently ready fur the extra steam to b<* put nn. Cotfery hat both the Broker and St. Lawranct* looking ?a-rell, theS.A.J.C. Ij*^>rT*rinn*jre>spec--—lly hav ing wonderfully unproi ed since his last pablic ap|n_rano. Two young ones, whose ap nroacliing threcyt-.ir ..Id car*v*r will probably lie marked by success, are Arsenal and Kemus, both colts looking very well, and the former is devdoping into a powerful hor***. ()!f Color never looked better than at the pre*r?ont time : and amon-jst the ..ther regular atten*—mta on tiie tradv may be mentioned Stornaway, Vergy, L?rd Wilton, Country Boy, I.(U r.,The Pencil (a beautiful mover), and S. Mahon's P-iarl e-ye*.
