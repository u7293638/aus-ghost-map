The Advertiser WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 28, 1878. PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT. TUESDAY, AUGUST 27. In the Legislative Council— A message was received from the Governor, containing his assent to the Port Adelaide Public Recreation Grounds Bill, the Inebriates Act Amendment Bill, and the Companies Act Amendment Bill. A private Bill giving powers to the Commer cial Bank of South Australia was introduced and read a first time. The further consideration of die Constitution Act Amendment Bill was postponed for four weeks. Tbe Council at 255 pjn. adjourned tul Thurs day nest. In the House of Assembly— Mr. Bbav, on a formal motion for adjourn ment, called attention to the appointment of Sir William Mflne, President of the Legislative Council, as an arbitrator for tbe Government. The Government defended tbe appointment, and a short debate followed. A motion by tbeSs?asos??for the adjourn mentof tbe House at its risins UllTh«rs4aj j was carried. Three tnottessi for tvtane were csrrisjd. i The debate on tke Oovers«SMt proswsiasas | fsr a ptupetty and income tax was mnrssai. | andeontuined tU neariy midnight. The Hon. j L."Glyde'e asaeodment was negatived. < Tbe House adjoomed at 1150 p so. tUI she i following Thnrsday. ! Thh debate on tbe taxation proposals of \ the Government was reeanted on Tuesday I and lasted till nearly snidnignt, and tbe only actual progress mad* was tbe rejection of Mr. Glyde'a atnsndment to the efect that new taxation ahoold sot bs imposed except simultaneously with, an alteration in the Ooetoms dwtua. Mr. Ward's] amendment, divided into two parts, is now before the House. He asks tbe Assembly to affirm that additional taxation is not ; necessary, and should that be carried, be will move that tbe Customs duties be re duced, and that the revenue be recouped by | other modes of taxation. A great propor- ! tion of the time occupied in this protracted debate has been taken up by Mir. Boss, who j ha* inflicted upon his fetlawH?einban half a-dozen long and wearisome speeches, each one, after die first, almost entirely a repetition of assertion! eantauMd in those which preceded it, and all consisting of violent attacks upon Mr. Boucaut'e 6n«ncial policy, and upon his conduct in connection therewith. Some of bis charges against the Premier of incon eistency and changing front are true, but there is no need for such painful iteration and reiteration, nor is there much profit to be derived from a hashing op of the dis putes of but session between tbe past and present Treasnrere. The boredom which Mr. Boss persisted in inflicting upon the House met with strong manifestations of impatience and disapproval in the form of calls for a division and in Mr, Bundey's pro test against the waste of time die ex- Treasnrer was T*«"ing-. Of course in Committee members are not restricted to one speech, but when a speaker feels called upon to rise again andagaiabe should at least be able to justify himself on the ground that he is bringing fresh infor mation to bear upon the sabject tmder dis cussion, or is replying to fresh txs^naeats or statements made for the first tune and hitherto unnoticed. Mr. Boss did not fulfil these conditions, opon which bs would have a right to daim the respectful indulgence of the House. He did not throw a t*j of li^ht apon the questions at issue. Many of the speeches of different members wen mainly directed to the question wsmlliis fresh taxation is needed to support tbe re venue, and this was proper enough, because the Government proposals assume the affirmative of this question, while many members, apparently the majority, are con vinced that with proper economy the ex peadituTe can be kept within die present estimated revenue. The proposition upon which there u least difference of opinion u that the pre sent incidence of taxation u an just and should be alined sj as to make the burden fall more equi tably upon tbe different classes of the community according to their ability to bear it. Messrs. Bhnms and Bower con tend that things are best as dkeyare,aad assert that tbe working daasssdonot feel the Castoms dories as oppressive, bate made bo complaint that they an ao, and on the contrary are quite contented. It is not true that the working classes bare made no complaints on thii wbject; they made the alteration of tbe Cas toms duties a test question at almost every district in the oolony at the kte elections, and having retained an overwbelnan? majority of members pledged to effect a reform in this matter, the dec tons do not see any necessity for lr«?pi«y up as agitation on the mAjecL Mr. Simnu conmdere tbe voice of the free and inde pendent at the hustings and their vote at the poUmp-booth as decisive with regard to Nock's Act, and why does he not apply the same principle to the matter of taxation:" It is absurd to say that people do not feel the harden of Customs duties; uninformed persons who do not study these subjects may not know what it is that makes such a drain upon their resources, bat they cannot avoid feeling the evil from which they suffer. A. man may be the victim of a painful disfsr. which be does not understand, and of which he does not know the cause, bat it would be preposterous to assure him that the tor tures with which he is racked are wholly imaginary. No man of small means can bave from £15 to £10 drawn out of him through the Customs without feeling it. Supposing a large portion of the com munity to be ignorant of the amount of unfairness with which they are treated it is the duty of an intelligent, honest citizen, and still more of a& honest repre sentative, to explain to them how they are being wronged, and assisting in obtaining justice for them. Mr. Ward, if possible, outdid himself oa Tuesday. He indulged in one of those at tackswith which Parliament and the country are so familiar, upon the daily Press of the i country, making charges absurd of them eelves, and contradictory of each other, against the leader-writers. Having thus laehed himself into a proper state of excitement, be we&t; in heavily for the working-man dodge, and in a torrent of impassioned oratory de nounced the income tax as most ini quitous, because it would send the col lector to " every poor man's door," for " few men in this colony," aaid the honorable member, *• are eo poor as not to be worth £200 a year." How any man in bis sober eensea could make such an extravagant, egregious statement, it is difficult to imagine. It ie like the fictions in which Falstaff de lighted, u gross as a mountain, open, pal pable." Some clever artisan, it seems, madea good bargain with Mr. Ward at Para Wuriia, and earned £'4 a week at piecework, where upon the ex-Mnnvter of Education arrived at the not particularly logical conclusion that this was die ordinary income of the working-men generally, whether they were masons, carpenters, plasterers, plough men, miners, navvies, or knockabout banda. Mr. Bees, who m*f be teVen as aa authority on tbe subject, stated that the highest wage ofafir6t-cbweartiaanis7(la.to7Bs.pM'week, and there are same* at Se. par day and laborersofooaneatsOH. Lnfsctitisthemast arrant nonsense to talk about tbe working daeses, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, being affected by the proposed in come tax.

Kerr, Waterloo (Acting-Chair man);' "Williams, Allandale; Fogg, Tarlee; Bfeiyike, Maaoora; AVhiUas, Eiyerton; and Heittersay (Hon. Sec.;, MarrabeJ. A letter re ceived from the. Honorary Secretary of the Ceu tzal Association etated that the suggestions re spectingtlie benevolent sdieme forwarded to them after last meeting bad been duly considered at their Committee meeting, and that the first and fourth suggestions did not meet with their approval, but the second and third irere agreed to with s. slight modification. It was resolved that'the'Central Association be requested to again remind the Council of Education of the difficulties that teachers in agricultural dis tricts had to contend with through the irregular attendance of their pupils, and asking that some allowance might be made in the examina tion for results to tonchoi-B of such schools. It was s^bo resolved that the consideration of the allowance for necessary expenses as per Be gulafion HI be postponed until next meeting. The following letter from Mr. W. E. Parry Okeden, dated Charleville, August 7, throwE some doubt (says the Brisbane Courier) upon *he rumored death of the Brothers Prout the two young Queensland explorers:—" The general belief here, throughout the west, at Cooper's Greek, and on the Diamantina, is that the Proute are dead; but so far as I can ascertain from reliable sources, and from persons who have come in very recently from the Diamantina and Western country, their remains have sot yet been found. Th report furnished by Goleman here in Hay las —as to facts asserted to have come within his own knowledge—cannot possibly have been cor rect; for 'Waitula, the etation on which he stated thetodies had been interred, is 118 miles wrath-east of Moakan, whieh is the nearest rpeint of the Piawintma, the starring plane of the Fronts being situated to the north-west, and tie -course they took being also north-west The'statemeaiasto the finding of the Bronte' bodies published in the Darting Jfimat Gazette jnust therefore also be inoorrect.

Nothing, however, is decided as to the route to , be foHo*red, and according to recent advices from *he Pap^, Sir Barge Irero is in favor of a land line as advocated by Mr. Sieve wrifiht bead of the XJolonial Telegraph Department, in a .paper read before the Philosophical Society.

The line would be in ttreto sections, of which only the first, from Gondqkorp to Zanzibar, would be through a comparatively unknown country. The cost is ; not expected to exceed half-a-mUlion sterling; vttdlsttie lowestestiaaate for asubmarinec*Me : from^fatal via Mauritius to Aden is a million, and the highest £1,427/WO. A- lengthy discussion was initiated in the .Assembly on .Tuesday, afternoon by Mir. Bray, as to the appointment by the Government of Sir WiUiam'Milae as an arbitrator in thedii- . "pute between the Oovemment andthecoutxactor Sar the Bivoli Bay Bailway Jetty. He argued that under the oonstitution Act members of Parliament wen debarred from caking any posi tion anterthe' Government from which they might obtain compensation, and that tiiePresi | dentoftteJaVjUsMmObswdlisaainD9differ* ent position from any^otlier mesabec. w*> **rtmi' the Government to dntmctiy say whether Sir William was performing tiiese duties without compensation, and whethar 4aey assumed that jnembenof fadjamssrteoald be Ssidr^sked to tmdertake such dirges without interfering with their position as members.

After a debate the formal motion for an adjournment which had been moved was negatived.

The Commander of the German man-of war Ariadne, when recently at Samoa, attached on behalf of the German Government certain ; Saroosn harbors as a, pledge tor the fulfilment at agreements entered into by native chiefs known asTaimna.andEaipole. TheAriadne then pro ceeded to Sydney, and, after thq commander bad communicated as to hia actuti with the , Government at Berlin, sailed for the Corea. The' following account of the -annexation u taken from the Samoaa Times: —" The Taimaa and Faipule having refoaed to faUl. or to state a. time when they would MET Article 4 of an agceement, or rather a distinct promise, made 'on the 3rd July, 1^77, guarantee ing tartly- the neutrality of Apia and its vicinity daring the last war, and partly guaranteeing full and perfect equality of rights to the Imperial German Government, the German ship-of- war Ariadne left our port on Monday last, the 15th instant, proceeding to Saluafata for the purpose of attaching that harbor and; vicinity as security for the faithful fulfilment of the said obligation by the Taimua and Faipule, or until further orders are received from the German Government The Ariadne left Apia on' the afternoon of the 15th, and arrived at S&luafata;, and on the following morn ing proclaimed the attachment of Saluafata for the abovenamed reasons. She left there about noon, end proceeded to Falealili, arriving there ?the same evening, and oo the wnnrn*nt? of the 17th that harbor was attached inthe same mimnw afi Saluafata, and for tf*p ■mtpo object.1* The Queensland Chinese Immigrants Regulation Act of 1877, and the Queensland Gold-fieldK Act Amendment Act of 1877, are subjects of a despatch from Sir Michael Hicks- Ee&ch;, recently laid before the British Parlia ment. The despatch, which expresses the views of tlie Imperial Government on those matter*. saysT—"l find that the objections entertained to the details of that ISifl have been sufficiently met in this Act as sow framed, and Her Majesty will not bo advised to exercise her power of disallowance in regard either to this Act or to the Chinese Immigrants Regulation Act of 1877. I understand that the influx of Chinese into Queensland has greatly decreased since these laws have been in operation, and I have also been informed that publie opinion in the colony generally, on the whole question of Chinese immigration, has considerable changed, I trust, therefore, that ere long the causes which have led to the passing of measures of such an exceptional character iray have sufficiently dis appeared to allow of a change in the policy on which these enactments are baaed. I need not, of course, assure you that I should join in de precating the introduction of Chinese into Queensland in such numbers as to give them aii injurious preponderance: but it is impossible, oa the other hand, not to perceive that, under > prorer restrictions, their labor may be of the j highest value to those tropical districts in which European* cannot perform field work. I cannot but think, therefore, that the true solution of the very serious diiEcalty with which your Government, has had to contend is to be found in the recognition of Chinese immigration, under careful regu'atiocs us to the number and occupa tion of the iniuiigrauie, rather than in ite dis couragement by penal legislation." Mr. H. Guinness being about to leave Mount Pleasant, where he has for the last eight years occupied the position of Post and Tele* graph Master, was recently presented with an j address and. twa valuable, gifts. About 25 gentlemen met at the Tjlunga Hotel, the chair being taken by the Rev. B. W. Holden. Re freshments having been introduced a few short addresses were made in which some very com plimentary things were e&id; regarding Mr. Guinness, and the following address, signed by representatives of St r John's Church, Mount Pleasant, ivas read:—"The Church Vestry of St. Joiui'e, Mount ;Pleasant, greeting, to H. Guinness. Esq. Deer Sir—We, the congrega tion of .St. John's Church, Mount Pleasant, South Australia, through the Vestry desire to say we cannot allow you to depart from us with out expressing our deep MMmtfwiim— to you for tie very prominent and active part you have taken in Church matters for the last eight years in this parish. You have with indefatigable zeal filled thetripleoffice of Lay Reader, Church warden, and Sunday-school Superintendent, ( greatly to the benefit of the Church |in genera], and the building up and I strengthening of the congregation. Most we say, after.sachj we regret your departure ? Yet we must rejoice, for our loss will be your gain, as you are going to enter the ministry of our i beloved Church. Be well assured, dear Sir, we ] heartily wish your ministry will be advanta geous to those among whom you will be called upon to minister. We hope yourself, lbs. Guinness, and daughter will continue to hare good health, which is the greatest earthly blessing." The Chairman then handed to Mr. Guinness a very hmH««m« marble clock, and Mr. James rhUlis, sea. (on his own account) Dresented the guest with a valuable silver ink stand. Mr. Guiaaesi replied briefly and appro priatrfy, thanking his friends for their thought ful kindafss, aad expressing the regret he experienced at parting with such old and valued friends. It is gratifying to observe (writes the Attstndasiim), tbat thegreatagricultural indus tries for which the various sods and climates of this vast continent are specially adapted are one. by one being developed with success. The chief necessaries and many of the luxuries of life are already prodnced in abundance, and witlun the last few years the cultivation of the sugar-cane ia Queensland has tnade such strides that it now fairiy claims to be ranked as one of the most rising jndnstries of the oniony. Last yeac?w? «e aaored cm official authoritj.wa* the tbe most satisfactory yet experienced by the grower* of sugar-cane, the results showing an excess over the returns of the hitherto most prosperous year, viz., 1874, when 12,108 tons of sugar were produced. There is every promise of Hie coming season of 1878-9 yield ing even better results, the production being estimated at about 14,009 tons. In 1877-8 8,043 acres of cane were crashed, yielding 12£43£ tons of sugar, 510,260 tons of molasses, and 196J000 gallon* of nun. This shows that the planters have, in a great measure, overcome the difficulties necessarily incidental to the acclimatization of a new . industry, and that the labor and expense of the past ton yean are now likely to prove remunerative. The local productions have bow almost driven oat of the market imported sugar and mm. Tori yean ago the imports of sugar amounted to 3,478 tons, and would, no doubt by this time have been double that quantity but far the development of the new industry; but last year only 382 tons of sugar were imported, while no less than 6,033 tons of Queensland sugar were exported and found a ready sale in the southern colonies. This is a large trade to have aprons; np since 1871, when the first 1| tons of Queensland sugar were exported. "The exports of nun, too, amounted to 87,293 gallons last year. The chief sugar-producing disbrict is at present the afackay, but large returns are also obtained from the central and southern districts. Dr. J. D. Thomas cave the third of his course of lectures on" Elementary Physiology," ■ in coanectten wibfa die Adelaide University, at the Stow Oboreh fcectare-HaU, on Tuesday ] evening, August 27. Then was * very fair j -attflrtr rrr The lecturer commeaced by com - j pletisfcthedesoription of the human skeleton, the first part of which was given at Che last lecture. Beginning at the blade-bom and , proceeding downwards, be gave an eUbarate and clear account of the working of the different bones, comparing diem with those of other animals, and showing the resemblance and dif ference between them. In referring to joints, he stated they eonstaed of three kinds, namely, those which werecapaMe of onlye gliding move ment; the hinge joints, where the booes were so formed that, though free as regards their extent, they were only capable of a backward and fcxwatd movement; and the ball-and socket joints, which enabled the bone to possess a much wider range of action. The joints at the knee, elbow, and fingers were of the second j class, and those of the shoulder and hip of the j third. In proceeding to the mnscular svstem j the lecturer stated that there were about SW ) different muscles in the human bedy. They . were distinguished by • bright red color, and in fact they formed the lean flesh of all ! animate. In size they varied from oue j sixth of an inch to two feet in length. ; They also varied in shape. The action .of the muscle* was then considered. Each { bone aefceii on by than might, the lecturer said, ; be regarded a* a lever, with it« fulcrum in the ; joint; the weight where the resistance was to be ; overcome, and the power where the muscle was j attached to it. In order that the bones aal | muscles should live it was necessary that , they should be supported with blood. The <;i -\ dilatory *ys?em supplied that necessity. It wan also necessary that there should be a force pump . in the system, so that the blood should cm tinuallr pass through. That want was supnlie-1 by the heart. Dr. Thomas then follow*! the course of the blood from the heart through th different arteries, snowing how it was distri ' buted to the various parts of the body. After touching upon the lungs, a short outline of the nervous system was giveit, which r*mi>leteJ a highly interesting, instructive, and well appre j ciated lecture. "The Stevenson conspiracy case at length came to a conclusion—though not a were imported, «fa en than 6.033 toni determinatioB —yesterday evening." write* the Melbourne Aryut of August 23. "The Croum prosecutor occupied an boor and a. quarter of the forenoon in concluding hia address for the Grown, and than Mr. Parvw placed Mr. Steveu son's view of the prosecution before the Jury. Mr. Stevenson, through hi* counsel, took up the same poaition in tbe mwnl eaaa tfaat in has all along auaintained in regard to the Customs authorities, viz., a, position of defiance. Tins prosecotioo, Mr. Porvas said, was only the last eiampki in tbe long asm* of «b -noya—es by which tbe Castoms authorities had revenged themselves on tbe tinn of Stevenson and bons, for baring failed in every attempt t«i establiah band against tbe firm. The charge ni for eoaapiring to illegally remove six cases of hosiery from the Custom! sheds, and the rin dictivenese of tbe proaecntion was proved by the fact that it was admitted that doty timl bc«n paid on tbe goods. Aa to wbnt had Uscome of the Bussing cases, or wbetber Stevenson end Sons bad ever received them, and if so, by what means, Mr. Purves scorned to give aay ex planation. Hr.Uolecworthmadeaveryelo^ufut appeal on behalf of Messrs. Bell & Code, and the conclusion of bis artdros? was greeted with a. burst of applause, which was immediately suppressed. Mr. Hood's defence of Wither, the Customs weigher, was short bat to the point. He said that if Witliey bad been guilty, and Mr. Stevenson had beun such an arrant fool as to place himself in the power of a Customs officer, Withey 7* place dunag the pre sent trial would have been in the witness-bji. and not in tbe dock. If Withey bal anything to tell, there was little doubt that the Govern ment could have offered sufficient inducement to a. Customs weigher muter suspension, and undergoing a process of slow starvation, to get him to tell it. It waa tbe big bird Stevenson tbe Government wanted to pot; they cared nothing about tbe other*. Mr. Justice Moleeworth'K charge from the v«-iy outlet wus, if possible, more severe ou tbe principal defendant than the ad , dress of the Crown Prosecutor. The Judge bul : already directed tbe acquittal of Mamamaja, tfce carter, and now informed the Jury that . there was no evidence against Bell, hinting, : also, that there was not very much against Cock. With regard to Mr. Stevenson, the Judge took ■np tbe ground that it was Mr. Stevensou's duty Ito have given a clear statement as to whether his firm bad or bad not received tits six missing ! cases. Tbe Jury retired at 10 minutes to 4 ; o'clock, and on being recalled two hours after : wards one of their number stated that they I were divided in the proportion of tea to two. : They were again dispatched to tbe jury-room, I and at 10 o'clock, the requisite six hours having . elapsed, still difffgr******!?. they were discharged. TLe defendants, except Macnamara, who was discharged, were then each required to enter into hit. personal security to appear when called upon, and tbe Court adjourned." \ The Freeling correspondent of the Ka i piiuda Herald, writing ou August -<J, says: — , A farmer, residing near Freeliug, who has lately ' inid a visit to tbe city, tells tlie following story \of bis adventures: —He bad been to a jeweller's lou business, and bad occasion, in payment, to ; present a £10-note, and had six £l-uote« given : him as change. Shortly after quittaug tbe jeweller's, whilst looking in a shop window, a ' man accosted him, and began questioning bim concerning various matters with the i City of Adelaide, in which he prof eased to be a : fctranger, having recently arrived from New i South Wake. My informant professed iguo i ranee on these matters, inf ormiiig him th&t; he ' was a resident in tbe country. At this ! (not very cousietently with Itifi fonner pro feesions) tbe stranger bam New Soutii Wales assumed the functaoos of cicerone, aud on arriving at the Exchange Hotel be said," Come and have ftgbus." My informant agreed, and they went into a email parlor. When there the stranger cang for the drinlrgj and i«lHng a seat motioned for bis friend to take a seat by bis side. This, however, was declined, my infor mant going to a sofa, saying he al ways preferred a sofa for a seat. It then turned out that the stranger had the same preference for a sofa, and sat himself dovn by the farmer's side. At this stage a very etout man wm"i«? his appearance, having in bis hand an umbrella. He soon made himself at home, and although the two stxange worthies affected never to have pre viously tiet, it was very evideut there was a tacit nndergtandiug between them. The stout gent then volunteered to treat his auditors to an furiionHi- history of himself, the aim of which was to impress his hearers or hearer with the fact tfaat he had been very bountifully dealt with by Dame Fortune. He said he bad a rich brother who bad died and bequeathed him £27,000, besides much property. He narrated en adventure which occurred the previous even ing, in which hehadbeendupedinto the payment cf sundry bottles of champagne to the amount of £17 by a game which be described as " five •gainst three." My informant's first acquain tance had been throughout the recital of tbe adventure very lavish ju his expressions of surprise and fncreduUty; indeed lie had over-acted his part, and plainly misahal «s? fact that be and the stout party were is «ae businm transaction. Mr. No. 1 badgered Mr. K0.2 with his " verdancy," sayin*; that las stood nochanee to win at the gamedsscribad. fhk the stout gent repudiated, a*S bet the other eight to one that he could, whieh bet was ao ceptod, and he again, of course, lost.

There was an improved attendance at White's Booms on Tuesday evening. Theeater faunment was very amusing throughout, and the ghost Oliisions were particmarly well performed. To those who have seen ootinng of the kind before Bainford's " Ghosts" will {wore vary interesting, and to some extent mystifying. The negro sketch**Othello"caused roars of laughter, and the Irish Xante closing the- entertainment was also en joyable, the illusions being cleverly worked in.
