HAUNTED. One day, alas, I lost my youth, I now not whon or how ; I only know I had it once, And cannot find it now. Eut ••nmetinnea in the winter 1 feel it in the air. And when the snowfiakes kiss my faoe It seems to touch me there. Then in the eprinpr the breezes That wander from the South, "With warm careless laden, Seek youth upon my mouth. And, oh, the summer sunbeams That make the roses blush— Tbey stir my blood and linger To bid my wan cheeks flush. My youth ? I los-t, it long ago, But of this fact. I boast— It may he dead, but, surely, I Am haunted by its ghost. —EDWABD VAN ZILE.
