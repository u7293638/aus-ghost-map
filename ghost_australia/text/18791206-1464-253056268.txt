" I could cata'ogue my wrongs till twinkling stars, Ruffled the linen of the fiery Mars." — David Buchanan's King Lear. Equal, in face of passiveness and chill, Equal, 'though roysterous braggarts spat contempt, Equal, 'though leaning on an untried skill, And carving (to write so) with strange instrument.

To all this equal : yet in helpless fog, Anent that anxiously desired Catalogue. «
