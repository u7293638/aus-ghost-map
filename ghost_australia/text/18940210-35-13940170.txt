OLD WORLD GOSSIP. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) JAJNlJON, UKO. 29. We are still in tho middle of the Christmas festivities. Wherever you go or in whichever direction you turn, it is easy to see that the present is a season of gaiety and hospitality rather than of settled work. The columns of the newspapers are still filled to a large extent with the lighter order of articles which is supposed to be fit this season of the year. The shop windows are full of Christmas and New Year's novelties, and in private houses the decorations of holly and mistletoe still keep their place. If you go to a friend's house the welcome ha!, a season- able warmth about it, and the good cheer a Reason noble character. I have a theory, which I know it is sheer heresy to enunciate, that Christmas has never been so well kept as in these modern practical days-that the Christmases of olden times, in spite of tho haunch of venison and the baron of beef, the Yule log and the waits, depend for a good deal of their lustre on the warm imaginations of the writers who provide our ghost stories for us and the clever artists who illustrate our Christmas numbers. I do not go the length of the sceptics who contend that Dickens invented Christmas, as Scott invented the Highlands and on the other hand, it is quite fair to admit that there was a time within the memory of middle-aged more time at which the Utilitarian school of philosophy was on rryingovcry thing before it-when the Christmas celebrations, like many other of our old customs, appeared to be in some danger. But the inevitable reaction set in, and it certainly seems to me that with the spread of comfort among all classes the special hospitality and good feeling which are supposed to be proper to Christmas have also spread, in the English metropolis at all events. Certainly no one who came to London How could fail to realise that he had arrived at a period of general festivity and no one who took the trouble to investigate one-half of what has been done in the way of sharing in the poorer districts in the last week or so would have much to say about the superiority of the " good old times " in this respect. The sulkies body of men I know at present are the members of the House of Commons, who have been dragged away from their homes and their friends to resume the dreary debates of the Parish Councils Bill in an atmosphere of depressing fog, which forces itself into the House, itself. They have turned up in good numbers because there is an unmistakable determination on both sides not to be outdone ; but it might be nonsense to pretend that they feel at home at Westminster at this time of the year. The discussions in committee this week have been, if anything, drearier than ever. The Boxing Night amusements this year were quite up to the average, and, as usual, every place of entertainment in London was crowded. Why the true cockney will endure so much and sacri- fice so much to got into a theatre or a music-hall in this particular sight of all the year is somewhat of a puzzle. The vast majority of the people who disported themselves in this way on Tuesday could have gone as legitimately, and with infinitely greater comfort, on any other evening, of the week. The crowd outside the principal places of amusement on Boxing Night is enormous, the fight for places at popular prices is keen, and in spite of the traditional good-nature of a London crowd at times a little rough and to wait for a couple of hours before the doors open in a packed throne: of perspiring men and fainting women might, one would think, take the edge off the enjoyment of the finest pantomime that was over produced. Besides, the Christmas pieces are never at their best on the first night. In spite of the most careful rehearsal the performance is apt to drag a bit, and it is not until the performers have had a fortnight or so to give character to their parts and brighten up their " gag" that a pantomime obtains its proper symmetry and swing. The true cockney, however, is a determined first-nighters, and he will cheerfully take things in the rough rather than wait. There was consequently the usual determined crowd outside the doors of Drury Lane, and an equally determined crowd round the entrances at the Lyceum, which has once more become temporarily a home of the pantomime. It is useless to attempt to describe either " Robinson Crusoe " or " Cinderella." At Drury Lane charming scenery, wonderful | dresses, glittering processions, and gorgeous com- binations of colour leave on one a mind is bewilder- ing impression of vast scenic eScot, with little or no connected story, and with fun it must be admitted, still of the music-hall type I do not know what this particular pantomime has cost Sir Augustus Harris, but I believe he has spent as much as Â£20,000 on a similar production, and this year he is supposed by connoisseurs to have exceeded most if not all, of his previous efforts It seems rather curious nowadays to associate the Lyceum with pantomime and as a matter of fact it's a quarter of a century since a pantomime was performed there There was a time, however, when the Lyceum ran old Drury hard in this direction Apart from Dmr. Lane, the theatres most faithful to the pantomime tradition are to be found on the Surrey side of the Thames The Surrey Theatre itself is still a famous home of the goblin the giant, and the names of orthodox pantomime, and of the harlequinade in full blossom, and there are other minor theatres on the same side of the Thames which have great reputa- tions for the Christmas spectacle, although they have no other particular chum on public admira- tion In point of fact if one wants to know what genuine pantomime was like a generation ago he would do better to go to the transposition theatres than to keep in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane The death of Mr Edward Stanhope removes a very familiar figure from the House of Commons it would he going beyond the limits even of post-mortem eulogy to speak of Mr Stanhope as a vivid and striking figure in contemporary politics In fact he belonged to that particular class of front bench men whom irreverent people dub "mere officials," and whose constant present in the chamber when their party is in power excites among the uninformed much the same kind of mild wonder as the existence of a fly in amber Lord George Hamilton is another of those statesmen Mr Shaw Lefevre, on the other side of politics, is another and Mr Childers when he was in the House of Commons, was another The fact is that men of this stamp represent the sound seasoned material of which a Prime Minister has to take account in forming his cabinet as well as of the more brilliant men who I have succeeded in impressing the public imagina- tion. No one can fairly deny that there is a con- tain vein of hereditary administrative capacity running in certain of the great English families which have been traditionally associated with soil tics and Mr Stanhope possessed this along with the distinction of birth, and in later life of landed wealth, which still counts for a very great deal in the case of a man who is making his way to the front the Conservative party That he so capable, painstaking and conscientious administrator will be disputed by nobody and although he SA as supposed to be crocheted at times and a little hard to be persuaded, it will be admitted by. all army men that he did excellent work during his tenure of Secretaryship for War Personally I had the privilege of knowing a good deal of Mr Stanhope, and I believe that in private life a more genial and unaffected man could hardly be found Of late years he has been a martyr to the trout, and early hours and strict discipline have been necessary to keep him in anything like decent health But no one dreamt that the end was near, and he himself, poor fellow, wrote only last week saying that he would be back in his place in the House of Commons on Wednesday It is curious that his brother, Mr Philip Stanhope, who is also a member of the House, is an ardent Radical and Home Blue Bat the two brothers had not a little in common, for all that I ought not to conclude this letter, especially as I have just been dealing with the theatres, without a word of reference to the death of a man who has done as much as anyone in his time for the amusement of the play-going public One can hardly speak of poor Henry Pettitt as a dramatist in the sense in which one would apply the term to keen student of human nature, like Mr Pinero, or masters of poetic diction, like Mr H A Jones He may be said to have built his plays rather than to have written them, everything aiming at stage effect, of which he was a master He first became known in conjunction v, lth Mr Paul Mentt, and I have a recollection a good many years ago of seeing a play from the pens of these two gentlemen which had a murder, I think, in each of three acts, and I believe a duel, or something of the sort in each of the other two But it is during the last 10 years that Mr Pettitt has been known to fame He has collaborated in all of Sir Augustus Harris's great " realistic spectacular " dramas at Drury-lane and in most of the plays of a similar character at the Adelphi. Ferwmtlly, he was very much liked by those who know him A shy, modest, retiring man naturally, his success in life ever gave him the least disposition either to assert him self or to become indifferent to the good opinion of others In appearance he was tall, thin, and pallid, with a heavy cavalry moustache His singularly long, consumptive-looking hands and slow, Kid way of talking earned with them the indications of feeble health. He has died at the age is JAN 1 The new year his opened quietly without much in the way of omens and portents We have had this week our first spell of real wintry weather biting winds, falling snow, and hard, nipping frost It is terrible work for the horses in London with the roads in their present condition and all things considered, it is little short of a man el how the multitudinous traffic is carried on But the London luck, when he falls has a knack of falling lightly, and although many people have had shakings, there have probably, been few broken bones either among passengers or horses Apart from this drawback to the street traffic, there is little in this spell of seasonable weather which Londoners have to complain about It is certainly better than the rain and raw mist, of which we have had too much Socially, as I said last V, took the season appears to be pretty well as gay as usual, in spite of the influenza and the depression in trade and politically, a truce has been patched up which has done something for a time to mitigate the bitterness of the party light in the House of Commons The Government have made certain concessions on the Parish Councils Bill which will have the effect of bringing the discussions on the measure to a close in the next week or two, and enabling some plans to be formed for the winding up of this unheard-of session But the compromise has been the work of the leaders, had the better feeling between parties is only skin-deep One of the oldest members of the House remarked to me this week that in his judgment there was more genuine rankling, and almost personal animosity between large sections of the rank and file on the two sides than he had known in tho course of his experience. The result of the angry struggle of last session has had, I fear, permanent results in diminishing that personal good-fellowship among members which at one time was sufficient always to turn discord into harmony as soon as a couple of political opponents passed through the folding-doors of the House into the lobby Things will go quietly to the end of this session but with the beginning of next session to determined and angry party conflict will inevitably recommence The New Year honours have created a sort of mild interest but there is nothing sensational about them A number of excellent hardworking officials have obtained such dignity as there may be in writing two or three or four capital letters after their names, and a number of Indian dignitaries have been admitted to a similar privilege along with distinguished gentlemen in the colonies Among the O Be are Mr Norman Lockyer, the well known Professor of Astronomy in the Royal College of Science, and Mr Preece, the heavily worked Chief Engineer of the General Post Office The political honours have caused, perhaps, as much amusement as anything else It is not quite easy to understand how Sir Donald Macfarlane came by his knighthood He is r worthy Scot whose chief claim to distinc- tion has hitherto been that he possesses the longest and the most patriarchal heard in the House of Commons He has done a good deal, however, to help the crofters of the West of Scotland, and has always been a faithful, though by no means slavish, supporter of the Liberal Government Mr Thomas Rose - known to his many friends as " Tommy " Roe- is a gay young bachelor of 61, who looks 45, and who has sat in the House of Commons for 10 years without, as far as I know, over making a speech He has the advantage, however, of being a colleague of Sir William Harcourt, to whom he says ditto at political meetings at Derby He is, besides, a sound man of business and an active worker in municipal affairs, and these qualifications, aided to unvary- ing geniality and good nature, are not overpaid with a knighthood One of the baronetcies goes to Mr Leonard Lyell, a Gladstonian member of Parliament who has acquired no particular House of Commons distinction, but who bears an honoured name He is a nephew of Sir Charles Lyell, the great geologist, and himself a man of considerable scientific attainments The other Liberal, Sir Theodore Fry, 18 the head of a great firm of iron manufacturers, and a zealous Gladstonian Altogether it will be seen that the list, is an interesting one in its way, is not a particularly striking one The warm invitation sent by the Australian colonies to the Duke and Duchess of York has caused very general satisfaction here, not only in Court circles, but with the general public I hear that the Queen, who is always pleased with any mark of attention to the young couple, was particularly, gratified and there can be no doubt that if the Duchess of York had been able to carry out her own wishes she would JOJ fully have accepted the invitation, as she is naturally lively and fond of moving about But the domestic circumstances which prevent the journey from being undertaken for the next few months are well understood, and, fortunately, they are not of a character to inspire anything but satisfaction in the minds of the friends of the young couple The official communication is studiously vague as to the future but among the entourage of the Duke and Duchess it appears to be thought that if all goes well the invitation is not unlikely to be acted upon in the course of next v, more In any case, the colonies could not possibly have done anything which would have given greater gratification at Court, and to a great many people who are not courtiers at all, than they have done in offering this spontaneous invitation New Year's Day was a great day for Manchester, for it saw the public opening of that are monsoons Enterprise, the ship canal Already local wits are rubbing their great dirty city " Manchester by the sea " There is strong local sentiment in Manchester-stronger perhaps than in any of the other large provincial towns and the enthusiasm over the canal is literally unbounded It is certainly one of the greatest engineering features of the century and, more than this, it has been carried out in the face of an opposition from powerful interests, more bitter and determined than probably any commercial enterprise ever had to encounter. A sail down the canal briugsoneateviy turn to some new triumph of engineering skill Perhaps what strikes the popular eye as most extraordinary 13 the aqueduct which carries the old Bridgewater Canal high above the ship canal This swings to allow a ship to pass, so that a section of the old canal is twisted right round, the aqueduct being fitted with watertight doors At the time when I saw the operation there was a bargo on the aqueduct which went on steadily making its way, and the effect was very curious The Great London and North-western Railway Bridge - seventy-five feet above the canal - is a remarkable structure A trip down the new water a v is by no means so dreary a business as might be supposed Near Manchester it cuts through a depressing country, and is fi singed by chemical works and so forth But towards the other end the scenery improved, and at some points a very fine view indeed is to be obtained, both of the Welsh mountains and of the estuary of the Mersey As to the financial part of the scheme, I am afraid the outlook is very black for the original shareholders The canal may pay the debenture holders and cover its working expenses, but it seems out of the question that it should over pay a dividend on the vast sum of Â¿15,000,000 which has been spent This is hard on the working-man shareholders, of whom there are many, but local patriotism makes the Manchester capitalist take the matter philosophically " It won't ruin me," I heard one wealthy Manchester man say who has sunk Â£20 000 in the canal, " and it will be the making of the town " Mountaineering in winter in our own country is becoming rather the fashion among a certain class of hardy Englishmen It is not without its dangers, as was shown a day or two ago by the painful death of Professor Marshall one of the best known promoters of the University Extension movement-on Scnfell The accident, however, was one of a character which might happen on any hill to the most careful climber The professor, who was looking for a point of vantage to take a photographic view from seems to have trusted the weight of his body to a large loose stones and to have fallen with it An occasional accident of this kind is to be looked for even an English mountaineering, just as hunting men have to confront the fact that an occasional fatal fall takes plane in the hunting field and it ought to do nothing to check the spread of a splendidly invigorating pastime Of course, the owner of an alpenstock of many inscriptions I would from the pure climber's point of view, look with contempt on the dangers and delights which the hills of our English lake districts afford. I There are no glaciers to cross and no crevasses to fall rate But there are many precipitous and difficult places, and two or three hours' hard and difficult climbing is nearly always if the weather be at all decent was rewarded by a i low, the beauty of which, mt. particular way, can hardly be surpassed' The thousands of tourists who, in visiting the lakes simply gallop from Windermere to Grasmere and Grasmere to Ullswater, have little or no idea of the real beauty of this delightful corner of our own country At the time of the year, too, the men, tain air is Uko strong wine and in winter pro. aided, always, that the sky is tolerably clear then is no greater danger to the climber than in summer the real peril of the English mountain, is the mist I remember some years ago being lost for an hour or so on Helvellyn, with a com-. person, in a mist which seemed to run from this earth like the steam out of a kettle of boiling, water We had gone up in spite of the warmth of the local folk, and when at last, after various rambling, we found the mountain path again and found our way back into " sunlight and sound," two more bedraggled creatures wet to the skin and numb to the bone could hardly have been found But a big fire and a good dinner at the little inn at the bottom of the mountain soon set us right again The Christmas pieces which have been produced at the theatres continue to draw large audiences As far as one or two of the leading pantomimes are concerned this will probably be the case until the end of February, or even well into March It will need to be so if the expenditure is to be reimbursed The only novelty this week is the production at Daly's Theatre of Garrick's edition of Wychorloy's " Country Girl " The revival u spirited and interesting Miss Echan as I>eÂ£f_T is excellent, as she is in most studies of a similar character, and she is fortunate in being associated with such a capital actor as Mr Farren in the part of Moody On the evening of New 1 Year's Day there was a performance of a long selection of the "Messiah" at the Albert Hall, which drew an enormous audience On occasions of this kind the away of Handel over popular gatherings IB undiminished, and although in some respects the performance may have been a little deficient, the choruses, under Sir Joseph Barnby's direction, were splendidly rendered It was interesting to note the intense interest with which the vast gathering sat on the three hours' performance
