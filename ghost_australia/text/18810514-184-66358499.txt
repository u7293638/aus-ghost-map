Not long ago a ghost haunted, and- now .they -hara ». «eal- -hy« road tyan toVgirate them. ; CM Sunday last the1 whole village^ was in an uproar, all the available police force was called out and placed ' Oder.

Tom Maloney's houBe on the Highlands was visited, and tba door wai found wrenched from its binges, and all the windows open. Presently something, aras Jeeti inside making á<**tsh for 4h*door,'iii^ a general stampede of the whole brigade took place, the lot marting for home-fences and ditcher being no impediment to the retreat of the army.

General Roberts hovered about the enemy and marked the road ho tooli but that is all he marked, for the maniac is still " wanted." J TOOK a stroll -along the Cornwallis Rood the other evo lo view the great eorfhwrrks being perFormel by the Trustees, and 1, with nine tenths of the people I met, came to the conclusion that a wasteful expenditure is going on in that locality. A couple of old fossils arc scratching about the mad and making things worse A couple nf old hens thought > .they were scratching for thoir «hicks, ii i ul they at once, in a very unmis takable nimmer, showed them that they could scratch better, make n bigger hole in less time, and lind more worms. But, joking apart, I think it is high <ime thut-ihis road was' taken out of its present comptroller's hands, .and placed in the hands of the Road Superintendent. This road has been a sore place for many years, and instead of the wound being Iieulcd it periodically breaks out afresh. MY friends, Alf Robinson and young Steve Dunston, were nearly wiped out ou Tuesday last. Thoy were cantering along thc road Hear Turnbulls corner, when a vehicle com ing «tong in an oposito direction startled Mr. Robinson's horse, and ho shied to such an extent that tho rider ivas thrown. Thc other horse jumping over thc prostrate rider and horso, and" throwing his rider, kicking Alf in the back of thc beud as ho went over, and' honing young ? Steve's knee. Mr. Robinson's horse was injured in the shoulder, add he gut a severe shaking, but fortunately nu serious consequences ure likely lo occur. Moral : Avoid ugly men when they are driving along a narrow road.
