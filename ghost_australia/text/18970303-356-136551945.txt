A TRUE GHOST STORY. Tins is a true English ghost storyof an unconventional kind. A young lady arrived late at night on a visit to a friend. She awoke in the darkness to find a white figure at the foot of the bed. While she watched the bed clothes were suddenly whisked off, and the apparition vanished. After an anxious, not to say chilly, night, the visitor went down, with little appetite, to breakfast. At the table she was introduced to a gentleman, a very old friend of the family, who had, she learned, also been sleeping in the house. He complained of the cold. "I hope you will excuse me," he said to the hostess, " but I found it so cold during the night that, knowing the room next mine was un occupied, I took the liberty of going in and carrying off the bedclothes to supplement my own." The room, as it happened, was not unoccupied, but he never learned his mistake.
