to the editor of the daily telegraph. Sir, — Of the £75,000 subscribed since 1886 which have passed through my hands in aid of tho suilercrs by fire, fiood and tempest, from the Lithgow disaster to the floods of last year, £25,000, I find from my note- books, came from the daughter colony of Victoria. This was spontaneously sent. Not a ghost of a hint being necessary to prompt our brethren there to give so bounti fully, due largely to that indefatigable man Fir. K. Fitzgibbon, then town clerk of Mel bourne. How has New South Wales re turned this noble gift, when the City of Mel bourne and suburbs were visited by the re cent disastrous flood ? Simply by doing nothing, thus showing that 44 federation was in the air " only. To have federation indeed, I would respectfully suggest to his Worship the Mayor of Sydney that of his own motion he should at oncc convene a meeting to wipe away this reproach, for tho purpose of inaugurating a fund to aid tho surviving suilcrers of the terrible 44 Gambicr " wreck which has just occurred in Hobson's Bay. The graphic description you havo given of this catastrophe should stir the people to do something practical. I believe our obliging town clerk would gladly see to the clerical work. I cannot afi'oru tlie time to under take this work at present, for it should be done at once, or 1 would be ouly too glad to heli).— Yours, etc. EDWARD J. H. KNAPP. August 30.
