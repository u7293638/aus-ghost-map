GHOSTLY BUT TRUE. Here is a story that comes from the Conti- nent. A widow, whose husband had left her in comfortable circumstances, decided to re- marry. Her husband had threatened to haunt her after death, and as she lived in constant dread of his appearing, she thought that a new husband would help to keep away the ghost. However, her second matrimonial venture was not happy, her husband deserting her a few months later. Shortly afterwards she was disturbed one night by hearing a strange noise in her room and looking round, saw a ghostly figure standing in the moonlight. The frightened woman buried her head in the bedclothes, and heard no more of the ghost, but when she got up in the morning, she discovered that her wardrobe was opened, and a good sum of money was missing. The police began to look into the matter, and soon fixed on the husband as the thief ; but as they persuaded the couple to be reconciled he was unpunished.
