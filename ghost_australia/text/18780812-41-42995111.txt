The start was, as we have said, at Mr. Blackler'/), and the direction was over the Reedbeds-road, then east, then north over the same road. Next after traversing the Lockleys Racecourse Mr. Blackler's land was entered again, the wind-up taking place in his paddock. The run was a very good one, and some of the fences of the stiffeat. Sarchedon did anything but well ; we dou't think he got over the third fence. Frank Hewitt was not iu the humour, while Sydney did not perform well. The Ghost wont very fairly up to the last fence, where he fell, and Meteor also came down. There were in at tLe death The Master Messrs. Colley, Bake well. Bickford. Parr. Moore, and Beauchamn.
