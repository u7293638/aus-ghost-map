MEN I KNOW. No. V. The Dun. The Dun ! the bane ! of all mankind the curse, His portrait I would fain put into verse ; But as I write I seem to see his ghost Standing without my door — his usual post ! The dun is always present. He alone Will try his best to get blood from a stone. He 's sometimes pleasant, sometimes he 's riled, And sometimes gentle as a little child, Sometimes attempts a joke — tries to be funny, But whichsoe'er he is, he aye wants money. Yet, take them all in all, they suffer long, And who can blame the burden of their song ? Yet they're a nuisance, and I hate the lot, Would fain be free from all — as who would not ? There 's one chap — he 's a most persistent man, Who tries to catch me everywhere he can : He '11 stop me in the street, indeed he will, And, say, with bow polite, " Your little bill. We 've waited long, sir ; could you send a cheque ?" (Oh ! how I 'd like to wring that fellow's neck !) Some are content to just rap at my door, Look in — and drop their bill upon the floor ; Then smile benignly, turn, and pass away — But then they 're sure to call again next day ! Then there's the postal dun, the man of stamps, Who thus his monstrous profits sorely cramps. His notes are very seldom opened, for It 's useless reading what we knew before. Last, but not least, we find the dun who sues, Who issues summonses, and will refuse The least delay. This is the violent dun ! Oh, how I hate the lot ! Yes, every one !
