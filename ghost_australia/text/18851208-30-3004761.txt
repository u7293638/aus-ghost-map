USEFUL SUGGESTIONS. To the Editor of the West Australian ghost see that in some cases tried at the present Omi Sittings of the Supreme Court the presiding Judge has refused costs owing to the nature of the claim. Perhaps the practice of bringing actions in the Supreme Court when small sums only are at stake, might be checked if the Small Debts Act were to be altered so as to prevent plaintiffs recovering in the Supreme Court any but costs out of pocket with profit costs on the scale given by the Small Debts Act in all cases where the sum actually recovered should I be under £50 and the Local Court could have tried the case. But if defendants I are oppressively taken into the Supreme Court they should be allowed costs on the Supreme Court scale. Local Courts have no jurisdiction to try actions where the debt or damage is more than £50 ; nor actions of ejectment or in which titles to corporeal or incur- poreal hereditaments, tolls, fares, markets, or any fee of office shall be in question, or ( in which the validity of any devise, bequest, or limitation under any will or settlement may be disputed, or for any malicious prosecution, or for any libel or slander, or for seduction or breach of promise of marriage. At present writs of execution out of a Local Court can only affect personalty not land. That might be remedied by a short and inexpensive process which might on application to the Supreme Court authorize land to be taken in execution where there is no personalty to seize. If suitors prefer the trained acumen and learning of the Supreme Court to the dulness and ignorance of the lower court, let them enjoy the privilege of sueing in the superior court. But courts are made in theory, at least, for the relief of suitors, not for the emolument of practitioners, and this fact might well weigh with the Legislature, who can do much to remedy the state of things now complained of.
