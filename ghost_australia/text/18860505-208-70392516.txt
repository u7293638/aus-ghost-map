ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. C.ESAR's GHOsr sends us the following HIC, HiIC, HOC. When the two Roman brothers were young, And at even were wont to recline At a supper of nightingale tongue, Washed down by Falernian wne, Either one would have probably laughed him self sick At the idea that "Hoe" ever came before ST. DAVID.-No- ; we cannot consider the Welsh language a pronounoed success. -Lu?QUaEnR-The Russian alphabet contains forty-one letters. Any Russian word can be made by changing the position of these letters, care being taken to use the entire forty-one.

No, it wouldn't thrive any better if boiled. Acculct.--It is hardly correct to say, in the case of a married man's death, that he "paid the debt of nature " If he leaves his " better half" behind him he compromises at less than 50 per cent.
