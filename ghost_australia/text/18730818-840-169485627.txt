Ipswich Observer, , August 16._ Pigs and Whistles.— The whole of Charleville and its immediate neighborhood was last week thrown into a state of indescribable alarm ; nothing like it has occurred since the awful fright the enthusiastic Scotch gave the Japanese ambassa- 'dors in Holyrood Palace, by the sudden burst of the most infernal screeches and screams from the national instrument. The fright of the Charleville inhabitants was caused by a noise as nearly resembling that of the bagpipes as any merely earthly noise possibly can do—namely, by the peculiarly musical gamut -proceeding from the throats of between one and two hundred pigs which had been collected from the bush and scrub on the Warrego, and driven towards Roma much against their inclination. Their intended arrival some time or other had been previously announced in the Dalby Herald. Mr. Hewitt is commander-in-chief of this perilous expedition, Mr. Simon Carrol being second in command, whilst the rear-guard is formed by Mr. ex-Native Trooper Tommy. What an ear for music Mr. Hewitt will have when he shall have arrived in Roma. ' (jharlovillo eorrespbndleht of Queensland ftirnesm ILLECTOII3 ,.
