AFTE? R LONG DAYS. After long days of love in loneliness. I move among the ghosts of dead delight. Hero where we kissed good-bye in dumb dis tress. Parted and passed into the gathering night. After long days the music of her feet Come floating down the old familiar ways; Not all the flutes in Lydia wore so sweet, Nor pipes in Arcady; after long days. I see her starry eyes, and in her curls The golden sea that beats about her brow. I see the sunbeams sport like Nereus' g:rls; I see the glad blood in her cheeks; and now Her soft arms clasp me with a strong caress, lHer soft lips thrill me with one tenderest kiss, After long days of love in" loneliness. Who would not part awhile to meet like this? -"Pall Mall Gazette." ..
