SIGNOR ROSSI AS HAMLET. (FROM THE FALL HALL BUDGET, HAY 5.) The success which attended Signor Rossi a representations in Paris rendered it almost certain that English playgoers would have on early opportunity of pronouncing their opinion concerning his merits as a tragedian and at a time like the present an actor whose reputation fell far short of that of Signor Rossi would be sure to attract attention by his impersonation of Shakspeare a principal characters We can scarcely think however that Signor Rossi was well advised when has decided upon playing Hamlet on the occasion of his first appearance in London Hamlet is the most generally interesting of all Sharks peared heroes. But our idea of the Prince of Denmark is such that unless we are previously familiar with the person of the ac or and have therefore prepared our minds for a slight shock! the presence of a new comer on the stage in the well known sable suit too often gives rise to disappointment This is particularly the case when as with Signor Rossi the performer happens to be a short and burly man Nothing is likely to expel the notion that a man with a turn for metaphysical speculation should be if not all at least slender and dreamy looking Signor Rossi 181 far indeed from representing any thought-worn figure in himself and the manner in which he dresses the part serves to display very completely the rather heavy sturdiness of his frame In the contest between mind and body the latter is evidently capable of under going a very severe strain without breaking down Thus from the time when Signor Rossi first comes forward there is a prelude 9 to overcome which would scarcely have been equally felt in any other character Signor Rossi throughout a most successful in passages where the greatest calls are made on physical exertion his least telling scenes being those which need for their success little more than a calm attitude of easy nobility Thus the first interview with Horatio Mir celia and Bernardo failed of its due effect and Hamlet a musing inquiries concerning the appearance of his father a ghost were by no means impressive But when the ghost itself appears on the battlements Signor Rossi is fully equal to the demands of the part The change from the thrilling cry Angels and ministers of grace defend us to the softened tones which follow the stress laid upon the te which expresses so much affection and the voice and action of entreaty half stifled by fear are admirably given so too in the impetuous rush when Hamlet hastens after the ghost and in like roca sure the passionate yet determined accent so little indicative of the hesitation and free solution to come-with which he propel it as his intention at once to avenge his father s murder As the ghost disappears Signor Rossi represents- Hamlet as too completely unstrung to lend due pathos and concentration to the lines which precede the return of his co a panionB The scene with them is spoilt also by the excision of those wild and whirling words which give the first hint that Hamlet's brain may be really unsettled by the temple story he had heard and the apparition he has seen Taken altogether however the 5 scenes with the ghost were worthy of Signor Rossi's reputation There was no date pointment either in the latter with Po forms. Hamlet is more rude in man 1er than usual but there is no exagGeration With Rosencrantz and Gaildeneteru however there is too much sameness Signor Rossi not only undoubted his friend Is but shows them from the first unmistakably that be does BO His brows are knit his 0 es glare at them suspiciously and his tone is that of sarcastic reproach There is no room left for the heartfelt appeal to their comrade ship by which Hamlet ultimately teats their loyalty Hamlet's position here is not unlike that which he occupies with respect to Ophelia later More fortunate than the Greek philosopher he has found at least one hot est man his friend Horatio, au i recognising this wears him in his heart of hearts But he is not content he believes that nearly all the world is engaged in a conspiracy against him and yet he is ever yearning for sympathy anxious to find that others are as honest as him self Thus he wishes to believe that even Rosencrantz? and Guildenstern mean went towards him by their sudden arrival and it is only their hesitating to answer frankly that drives Hamlet to beware of them as of men who in the battle between himself and the world have taken sides against him in the difference between his earnest manner in asking the question and the cold politeness at the end of the scene may be traced the change from hope and doubt to confirmed suspicion and distrust. Bat of this Signor Rossi shows us nothing On the other hand he plays the madman more thoroughly than any actor we have yet seen in the part His dress neglected his speech rough and his whole manner boorish this is indeed the observed of all observers quite quite down Signor Rossi may maintain that he is not wrong in this too may allege that Hamlet is not a mere Merry Andrew in his feigned or half real insanity He is so far 11 id in his behaviour that he received not only his mother and his lover but the self seeking old courtier Polonius as well as the young courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern who are specially sent to pay him out Two men alone question his insanity but' from far different reasons-the king because his own conscience is uneasy and Horatio be angelic knows that at times at least, his friend is perfectly rational To allow the mask to drop from his face even for a moment would be to betray at once the somewhat inconsequent plan which he has adopted in order as he thinks to pain his ends Thus Signor Rossi s Hamlet is at any rate consistent and maintains the character unflinchingly Passing by the first interview with the players with the observation that by a strange misconception PolomuH addressed a remark to them which is really made to Hamlet we come to the Bohloquy O what a rogue and pleasing alive am I and we believe we do the as of no more than justice when we say that fry 11 beginning to end this was perfectly and most naturally delivered Variety of tone a id action vigour and pathos were all fittingly displayed in turn That passage where Han- let turns upon himself for thus ranting at wits away was specially tolling and the Italian in parts here is in Signor ROES s mouth Sfogare come una feminine era lit cattle is almost worthy of the original The act concluded with well earned up plause In the mournful scene with Ophelia Signor Rossi adopts a quiet self contained tone of brooding Badness and bids Ophelia go to a nunnery in accents faltering with cr of She too like the rest has he thinks a lot in honesty and henceforth must be reckoned among his foes the stage business detracts from the effect of this Been We now come to the play scene and in this Signor Rossi so over plays his part that he entirely spoils it He lies down at Ophelia a feet and rolls and kicks about' in such a fashion makes such grimaces and turns the fan about in a manner SO grotesque that the King would have wanted no better excuse than this conduct to get rid of him at once Madness in great ones must not in watched go says the King just before but here is a man in such a violent stage of lunacy that nothing short of a strait waistcoat or a padded room is appropriate to his condition When the King c this for lights and departed in haste it is only in keeping with Hamlete previous behaviour that he should at once rush up the stops a 1 ! seat himself in the King a chair apparently in a paroxysm of delight It is impossible to agree with Signor Rossi s reading of this portion of the drama. Hamlet whatever his deficiencies may be is at any rate an admirable actor Yet he carries his madness or allows it to carry him beyond all bounds concluding his vagaries with an action which would make it appear that if the throne rather than vengeance for his fathers death at which is aiming Hamlets interview with mother again brings Signor ROBRI before is in a more favourable aspect When he has siam Polonius hoping by this sudden a 11 rash act to have made up for his previous irresolution andproceedatowrmghiamotbor * heart by denouncing the uncle who n h ought long since to have reckoned with Signor Rossi does exceedingly well His six pression of wrath tempered by the still exist ing regard for his mother huscompariBonoftl 0 two portraits which is however arranged in the rather clumsy fashion with Io tests -practiced such an effect upon the audience that they forgave and even applauded the rather forced action in which Signor Rossi Bnatchea his uncle a portrait from the Queen and after a series of passionate gestures tramples it under foot Again too during the appearance of the ghost and in his oar nest pleading with his mother when it has passes away Signor ROBS! was successful indeed in this last passage the tones of the voice alone were sufficient to awaken sympathy With this scene Signor Rossi's opportunities for strongly marked effects con- almost to an end. The fifth act is du d id into two the grave digging scones forming one act and the fencing another in the former Signor Roast failed once more to convey the idea that Hamlet was a man of high refinement and cultivation. It is doubtful whether this particular scene which depends so much for its effects upon the contrast between the practical humor one philosophy of the gravedigger with the overwrought speculations of Hamlet, cm over he satisfactory in a foreign language The scene of! Ophelia's burial is mach ed down, and this portion of the play was hurried through in representation. In the concluding scene of the play, when Hamlet is made aware of the fact that he is poisoned, Signor Rossi displays an energy which serves to bring about an unusual end- ing. He tosses up his soil, and, catching it by the middle, uses it then as a dagger to plunge into the king's body, and follows this attack up by forcing the contents of the poisoned cup down his uncle's throat. Hamlet then, for the second time in the play, Beats himself on the throne, and dies to the sound of martial music, which proclaims the coming of young Fortinbras, to whom he leaves the Crown. Signor Rossi's performance, though very powerful in ports, is not a satisfactory one.
