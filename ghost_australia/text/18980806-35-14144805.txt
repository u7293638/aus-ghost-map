HALL CAINE AND A MANX ESTATE TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-In your issue of July 30, amongst the " Literary Gossip " there is the following " A crowd of Manx farmers and others who recently attended a sale by auction of a large farming estate known as Ballahoo, near Ramsay, were surprised to find Mr. Hall Caine among the bidders, on " Also that " he was opposed in the bidding by a Mr. R. Carney, who is a member of the Manx Legislature." Permit me to assure you there is no such estate in the Isle of Man as the one named above ; the place evidently meant is " Ballawhane," in the parish of Andreas, and is about six miles from Ramsay, on a portion of which a " fairy doctor " did dwell. The name of Mr. Hall Caine's rival should be, I think, Mr. Robert Cowley, who has been for some years a member of the Manx House of Keys, that branch corresponding with the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. I may state for the benefit of your readers that the House of Keys consists of 24 members, who are unpaid , they are elected by the people, and deal with interests quite as large as those administered by the 125 paid members here. They are mostly business men and do their work well and thoroughly to the satisfaction of their constituents, otherwise they need never face them seeking re-election. Mr. G. H. Reid would not have the ghost of a show there. I am, etc, I August gas MANXMAN.
