THE FISCAL ISSUE. Tliu public is assured 11ml. the lending pro tectionists have given every possible assur ance Hint they "will resist, during the whole T-ni'lIiimcul: any attempt to reverse tlio fiscal " J4K- iifimi'M inf» ntmonded in !Hn«- Ration. Where are Hie oilier eighty odd protectionists'.' And, above all, whore is Mr. Lyno's inline, who is protectionist leader? It is very Important to glance back a Utile over tiiis exciting history. The lirst compact suggested was this: "Tlitlt the exe cutive committee of the New South Wales Federal Association will endeavor to secure that every seat shall be contested by a Fede ralist who will support Federation under the leadership of Mr. Burton, and will op pose any reversal of the liseal policy during tho ensuing Parliament," The protectionists would have none of it, nnd In its- place ac cepted tlie following: "That the liseal ques tion shall remain in its present (1st July) position until the Federal question Is decided by tlie next l'arliainenl." It will lie seen that whatever pledge six loading protocitiou- tsts may have given about "tlie whole l'ar liainenl," the ninety odd protectionist candi dates are not bound by il. They have a free hand for Hint Parliament after the Federal issue lias been disposed of. What will they consider a "settlement of tlio Federal ques tion V" If tlie I silver Hi/use kicks it out, we may lie certain what lo expect next. But if there is a hitch in Hie Council, will 1.1m liseal floodgate let in the flood of protection? If. needs no ghost to answer the question. The danger of the position is clear. Sensible freetraders like Mr. John Hughes sa w it. in lime. It is not yel. too late for tho other free traders to reflect that an alliance of free traders with protectionists Is as perilous as it is unprincipled and unprecedented.
