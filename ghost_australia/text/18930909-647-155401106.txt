BAPTIST AND WESLEYAN RE UNION. On the 18th ultimo, the Wesleyan School at Petersham returned a compliment' re cently paid by the Baptist Sunday-school, in the form of a social meeting and supper. The introduction of supper after the events of the evening, in place of the orthodox tea, was a great success. The ministers of the churches were fully represented in the Bevs. J. A. Soper (Baptist), W. Woolls Butledge, and FJ Colwell (Wesleyan.) At the meet ing in the school-hall the Bev. W. W. Butledge presided, and after singing ' To the Work,' and prayer by Bev. J. Soper, the Bev. F. Colwell, representing the Peter sham Wesleyan school, welcomed the visitors, and, in doing so, expressed his regret that his sojourn among the brethren at Petersham was soon to expire, eulogising the Bev. J. A. Soper, with whom he had been able to work so cordially during his ministry at Petersham. A programme of solos, recitations, &c;, having been gone through, an anonymous paper was read by Mr. A. Strangman Taylor (superintendent of the Wesleyan school) on 'Sunday-school Work.' Mr. F. B. King (superintendent Baptist S.S.) and others offered remarks Miss Palmer (BaptistS.S) striking the proper chord when she spoke of the Holy Ghost as an absolutely essential adjunct to be a success ful winner of scholars for Jesus. At the supper table the Bev. J. A. Soper tendered some valuable advice to teachers. These re- unions have been the means of stimulat ing brotherly love in no small degree, the two schools holding a prayer meeting on the first Sunday in each month at 4 p.m., at the respective schools alternately. It is the prayerful desire of all that other Sun day schools may join in a movement so deserving of commendation.
