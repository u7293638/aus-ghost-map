■WHEN LOVE PASSED BY. I was "busy with my ploughing, "When Love passed oy, 1 Come,' who cried, * forsake thy drudgtQg; Life's delights arc few and grudging; "What hath man of all his strivings, All hut planning and contriving, Here beneath the sky 1 When tho grave opes to recoivo him Wealth and wit and honours leave him— Lovo enduren for ayo 1* But I answered: * I am a ploughing. When with straight and even furrow AU the Held in covered tlirough, * I will follow,' Love jiasacd by. I wns bus)' with my sowing, "NVhen Love passed by. 1 Coino,' she cried, givo o'er thy toiling ? For thy moil thou hast but moiling : Follow me, where meadows fertile Bloom upsown with io.se and myrtle, Laughing to tho sky : Laugh for joy tho thousand flowers Birds and brooks—tho laughing hours All unnoted fly.1 But I answered : * I am sowing. When my acrcs all arc planted, Gladly to thy realm encnautcd I will follow.' Love passed hy. I was busy with my reaping, When Love passed by. 4 Come,' she cried, * thou plantcdst grisving, Ripened sorrows art thou sheaving. If tho heart lio fallow, vain is Garnered store. Thy wealth of,grain is Less than lovt'fl least sigh. TIasto thee—for the hours fast dwindle Ere the pyre of Hope shall kindle In life's western sky.' But I answered : i I am reaping. "SVhen with song of youth and maiden, Iloine the hock-cart comev, full laden, I will follow.1 Love passed by. I had gathered in my harvest, When Love passed by. 4 Stay,' I called—to hev, swift speeding, Turning not, my cry unheeding— * Stay, O Love, I fain would follow. Stay thy flight, O ileet-winged swallow Cleaving twilight sky I I am old and worn and weary, Void my Holds and heart—and dreary. With thee would I fly. Garnered woe is all my harvest, Sad ghost of mv dead hopes haunt mc, Fierce regrets, like demons, tannt mo— •< . Stay !—I follow I* Lovo passed hy. | '■"Solomon Soli^Cohcn m Scmnerst
