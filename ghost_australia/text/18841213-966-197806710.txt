MOON-RISE IN AUSTRALIA. {From " Earth's Voices," by WILLIAM SHAEP.J A trackless forest all around Of lofty gams that from the ground Aa saplings sprang in ages past. The short, sweet twilight fadeth fast, And from the forest's depths 1 hear The locusts' whining noise, the clear Soft magpio's song, the sudden scream Where cockatoos like white ghosts gleam Among the melancholy boughs; The wild dog's bark from where there browfe £ Stray herds of kangaroos—the cry Of something death-struck. As I lie , And listen to these sounds I see long moonbeams pierce a lofty tree, lake landom lances thrust to kill Scire tiend ivho baffles all theii skill; And even as with sleepy eyes I watch, the fall moon through the skies Sail* with a seeming moveless motion— A globe of fire in a purple ocean. Prob&Wy; one of the most trying times in a man's life is when he introduces his second wife, seventeen years old, to his eldest daughter, who is past twenty.
