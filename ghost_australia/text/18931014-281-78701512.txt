VS1THS AND A C02OT. The Uev. George Mnrtiu write* to tlic S. Jr. Herald: â€”" In obscrvijig the phmct Venus this (Thursday) evening just after sunset, with .1 lin. Gnibb equatorial, I was surprised to liiid a couict in the sanio tolcsconic iidtl with the planet. I thought at lirst that it must be a ghost, or some flaw in tho glass; but on turning the telescope on to the double star Anfares, I found things all right and the little com panion to the star quite distinct. On rc- olis'jrving the planet with various ]iou"cr? tiie comet was a lino object. [11 relation to the planet the nucleus was south, following, and the tail spread out in a fan-like curve, in part enveloping the planet but in nowise detracting from its brilliancy. For a few moments to tho naked eye. the planet was involved in a distant ? nebulosity, though 110 clouds were in j the sky nenr the planet."
