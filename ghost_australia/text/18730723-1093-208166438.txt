GENERAL NEWS. assay by Mr. James of 20 ounces' of quartz from the Eleanor Claims,* Pine iOreek; has given a result equal to 20^ounce's of gold to the 'ton. Tho stone, before ; being .tested, . showed scaroely a spec of gold visible. We hear that on Monday and .Tuesday mornings, the frosts; were so sharp in "the hills that injthe neighborhood of "Aldgate Pump" and Eohunga ice an inch in thicknessjwas found:' The white-froit-remained on the grass in some, places after 10 o'clock in the day. •• We hare been informed sithat a new. discovery of gold has been made in the Tiers,' aboufci two :andi a.-half miles ;fromi the Onka-' paringa Bridge, and near the old road between" Crafers 'and the" Wfieatsheaf. A very.:goad prospect was obtained from some quartz which was roughly crushed with a hammer, and -washed. Several reef-olaims have been pegged out, and one party at least is sinking a shaft through very, promising looking ground, with the'view of cutting the reef.- '' !
