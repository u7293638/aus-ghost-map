PITT-STREET CONGREGATIONAL. THE CRITICS WHO STAY AT HOME. In memoriam services were conducted yesterday morning and evening in the Pitt- street Congregational Church by the Rev. E Tremayne Duns tin The pulpit was draped in black and white, and adorned with white lilies The church was crowded at the morning service Hymns and anthems appropriate to the occasion were sung, and at the conclusion of the service the organist. Miss Frost, played the Dead March in Saul " The Rev Mr Dunstan based the subject of his sermon-" The Mary 1rs of Christianity and the Critics who Stay at Home upon the following test Matt -Ryan , 17 20, a And when they saw Him thevnorshippolHun but some dont ted And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptising; them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatso- ever I have commanded you and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world " in the course of an impressive address the preacher said We worship to-day under the influence of a great sorrow We have received tidings, the truth of which we have only too good reason to believe, of the martyrdom of faithful men and women who were the pioneers of Western commerce and civilisation in far-distant Cathay and we especially mourn the loss of the heads of the Cross who have laid down their lives in the defence of the Gospel I reserve until this evening what I have to say concerning the martyrs III the cause of civilisation, and I will only say now that it is not only execrable taste, but also absolute injustice to belittle the influence of those men and to brand them, as some have done, as agents of the international game of " grab " We have recently been reminded of England's part in the opium war Every English- man will admit that the opium war, which forced an iniquitous traffic upon China was a crime as well as a blunder , but, unfortunately, the question did not stand alone, and China herself gave clear evidence that the moral consideration was not upper- most in nor thought Li Hung Chang loudly protested against the forcing of the opium upon China I do not attempt to excuse the conduct of England in that lamentable crisis Under any circumstances her action was inexcusable but no one who reads history can fail to see that China herself seriously complicated the position and obscured what might otherwise have been a dear issue Some people scoffed at the interests of British investors as if those who lent money to foreign Mates had not a perfect right to look after their own interests, and do not give the least credit for the honest administration which has replaced the corrupt methods of Chinese officials My special purpose this mornings to vindicate the missions and to honour the memory of those noble men and women who have laid down their lives for the sake of the Gospel Three years ago our brother, Howard Smith, stood in this pulpit, gave his confession of faith and was solemnly ordained to the work of the ministry And now we have reason to fear his work in the lower ministry has come to an end " A wasted life," the doubting world would say. Wasted? Yes, if the Master's life was wasted Wasted P Yes, if any sacrifice for God and humanity can be wasted Our friends in China have not finished their work They have greater power now than when they witnessed in human speech before those to whom they ministered and though the. result of their work may not be seen for a time, though the mission buildings may be razed to the ground, and every external trace of the mission work be lost, yet will the influence of the missionaries live, and in time the work which they have done shall grow mightily. Mr Matthew Goode, of Adel side, has given three daughters to the mission field with a noble spirit of sacrifice be sent them forth at his own cost One boy died, another has been left a widow through the martyrdom of her husband, and the third has only been spared because she happened to be on furlough We have not the full list of those who have suffered martyrdom but naturally our own minds turn most readily to those whom we ourselves knew Howard Smith lived and worked with us His consistent Christian life, his zeal in Christian service, his devotion to the missionary ideal will remain as a heritage to the Church in which he found a spiritual home, and his gentle wife, concerning whose safety we may still cherish teacher in our Sunday school, and will live long in the hearts of those who knew and loved her. 11 these have fallen, the least that we can do is to give them that tribute of honour and affection which we have given to our hallowed dead and a memorial tablet within the church will habits symbol of the more enduring memorial which is in our hearts. Our work is to go forward whether the world cheer or frown.
