Saying which he placed a note on the table and disappeared.

Quin took up a pistol and cried: "Angels and ministers of grace, look here. Mr Ghost, I am speaking to you;. and, if you do not this instant acknowledge yourself to be one of the human speciese I'll make a ghost -of you in earnlest I" The apparition fell upon his knotes, and explained that it was the master ot the adjoining house, andt h had con, trived an opening in the olhimney in order to terrify the landlord, anld pro: vail upon him to quit the house, that he, the ghost, might see his own nami awing upoU the sign post, Tihu speotL' was imlnmediately coumpollel to drink a hllumper, the host was sulmmonetd, and the nftlrtunltte aplmarition wals coon. gelled to leave the neighborhood,
