RICHARD III. ?J WENT to we Jtieftara! ///. recently. J in T?ry much interested in the pUj >nd when I went hams I get Ht my EnglH History aaal extracted ? fear factt tbci him. He wm a gentleman who h?M the rattr dangerous position of King of England* term or m during the fifteenth century, w> seemed to have an erer- pretens, irreeittil? desire to commit homicide on hit entire con of relative*. I don't know of • more ri?V position than that of a relative of hi*;t was a very unhealthy thinp; : n?ne of to relatives lived long, and the life inrurane companies nlways charged the*, twicet? much us they dirt any one else. Occasionally he would run oulof relitirj*, and then the good people of "Merrie Ehg land" who were wealthy, or who had ione anything that might peMibly have offeried him, would get out in the country for • ew weeks or over to France for their healh t it. ?? about the healthiest thing tbj could do. I am very gUd I did not lira in thi fifteenth century. There wa* no telling whan atroebo*? would drop around with a guard if aeldir* and invite yea oit to get a divorce fm your head. There waa a great deal *f variety abatt these murder*. Sometimea they wouU ret tip a nica display of fireworks with the victim, • nico bonfire forming the o*"'*l -piece of the programme ; occasion*l! 'hey would turn him upside down in • caak of wine, er pitch him eter the cai?? ??lta into the moat. They were the most injeiions people in the world far deriving new ?ay? ef shuffling eff the mortal coil—for other people. They alwaya w?nted ?on)e ene else to do the ihuAHine. Richard would Ye awake all night tone time*, and rig Uf tome kind of a nice autumn-style homcide, and then h? would pick out a wealth) gentleman whoar estatee would revert backt? the Crown, and try it on him. It made >• difference whether the man had dene anything or net—if there we* no charge again;! him be would hunt op one. I rather liksd tU play, though. It wm written by a perron named Sbuetpeare, to the programme nd. Richard dial very little durinc the play eicepa give order* to the half starved mil ions in tin cheat pre lector* ami sheet ir?i pantt, te go out and get up a funeral, aid make disconnected remarks in sixteenth century English. There i> very littli detail in the tint twe or three acts. In Ac 1.. Richard nominate* himtelf fer King, aid then having nothing particular to do, he (roe* around to the Tawer and pjrwnally attend* to a murder. In Act 11. >c make* arrangeennt* to mnrry a widow whose husband he had removed a few daw previously. In Act 111 the Lord Mayol, accompanied ay the County Ommissiomra and the chief of |>olire, and a miscelsneous assortment ef lord. 4c, come roend, and the Duke of Buckingham tellt hin he has get to be King, whether he want* vo be or net, and he accept* the position, and nays he will try to rule England welt—l suppose he did the besthecould. He held the position of King for a couple of yean without any treublr, nnri then a gentleman named Richmond, who at that time ?.as in France for hi* health, took a notion '.hat he would like ♦/> he King himself ; so ha challenged Richard for the championship oi the world, and the winner to lake the c*le money. This mad* Kicharri m?d, and he killed a few people who happtoed to be convenient —not becauae they hari dona anythinjr, but becauae hs wu mad aiirt had to kill tame body—and then he wtit oat and organised a little private delegation of English warriors, and atartd out to wttle with Kichmond. The curtain rixes on Act VI. at thi' stag* of the game, and diactver* Richard making a few blantvrrw irmuki to hi. army And let me say rigiit here lli<t that army wa* the mo;! impartial armj I ever raw. Ther would reive Richard for an act or mi and then they would de?rt to the enemy for awhile and after they ha-i not done wrving on that >ide they wouM cmnc back to him again. Sometime* thny wonld be English lordi> and they would be Norman noblet. When they weie lord* they wore their haU lite other way and pulled 'vj their tights—that was all the change of cos tume that tli'y indulged in. A? the army they ?etc armed with double barrelled b?ttle-aie? and Winchester rej>eat halbcrdc. There were tic of them. Kichmond was dres?ed ituch better than the army. He wore a ?jinne ttyle cut- away <>hiri of mail with silver plated panU: ever tbe whole oiittil he were a white overcoat with a buttonliol* b<mi|uet of one n?e embroidered on it. He made a few remarks en general sub jectf. called Richard a number of hard names and then he took hi* army and went •way. Presently Richard came in with hi* army (which wan the army pi?vioui!y mentioned), and hf pow powrd around anhile, and then he made hi.< >oldier> an oration. He told them what a good King he had been, and how well he had *l?'ay- ruled England, and how he would hate to sre any one cUe tiep in and tpoil all the ftxx work %i had e'one, and be har?h and cruel v them and their children, and he told them how much he loved them, and how t>ece?ary it wa* for them to have ?nw out to rule over them that understood them and loved them v well as he did. "My noblt follower*." aaitl he, "thall ws let this .urvehnsr fot, with no aacenera and ready-made armour, come overbore ajwi claim my throne? No*, much. Use the grrat and glorious privilege Heaven ha* granted you, and wade in and defend your country and your King, anil when you hare wiped the floor with these frog-eaters I'll raise the tariff and pay you your salary—if you are still alive." This satisfied the army, and they went away, and Richard tried to go to sleep ; but |he was troubled with ii-digestion and bad dreams, and taw a who!.; lot of ghosts and things ao hecenldn't sleep to de any geod, but lay awake filing up a new way to kil Richmond the next dty after the buttle. * By and bye they kad a battle, and they I divided up the army and had a real nice tcrap uinonr themselves till the tUge I manager chased them off the stage with an I axe f that Richard and Richmond could [ fight, and then ihtf hacl to tight too, and Richmond pulverised Richard, and the army tU shuck hunds, and t.be curtain want down.
