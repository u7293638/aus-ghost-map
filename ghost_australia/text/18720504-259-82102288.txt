It really would seem that caprice more than judgment had regulated the distribu tion, both as respects the town and the district ot Eastern Downs. j This might lie remedied in com- | mittee, but. say the Opposition, in effect, you shan't get there unless you postpone all other business to this1 bill, for in cfl'ect there is no security j against their repeating the same tactics upon every clause which displeases them, that they arc employing on the j main questioo. Most probably they j would. Thus the legislation of the; colony is suspended lor the obstinacy of a minority. Certainly Mr. LILLEY dislikes single electorates-the great merit of the bili to us and to many of Iiis own party as wel]; and he may see in tne possible delay or even destruction of the measure a prospect of1 tbe continuance of that cliquism aud bunching, which is the main source of bis strength in Brisbane, and the disgrace of that electorate. As to his scientific authorities we will judge of them when we know who they are. The honorable'gentlemen has a remark able faculty of raising ghosts of that sort, and we prefer something tangible. But why is all legislation to be post poned until the leading members of the Opposition are satisfied with a measure not in the least calculated to give them satisfaction ? 1 Is there no possibility of a com promise of procedure; cannot'lhe busi ness be so arranged that simultaneous progress may be made in all the mat ters before the Assembly--that is, so far as the regular forms of the House will permit? Is it absolmely necessary that all 6upply shall be voted before the re- distribution bill or any other bill ran be considered. . These are questions which the. country will be asking, and it will ask, moreover, yitiai veal dignity is concerned or what real purpose will be served by an unyield ing obstinacy on either side. It is' mere' childishness to say "we have said that-we would not give way, and. we won't." Up to the period when assent will pla&e; the supplies or- the bill beyond recall there is ample room for progress in the business of the session. I Will any one say why- up to that point ] at least it should not go on ? ? ? j \- As to die worn out assertions that i the minority represent the greater! number-that the majority vwe their fixate to a dishonest dissolution-at»d' iWlike, we are tired of refuting them. Gould they not be refuted they can under .the constitutional circumstances have no practical operation. There is the House as it stands, every member ha* to do hit duty by the constituency j which elected tiiq).
