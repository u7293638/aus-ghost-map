One day Jinm Fetter was sick, andi sent;hnother man `in .'his 'place ; ands the doctor coming home late in: the aftei:nbooi' after an uncomimonly Ihard round visits, found the new man wait ing toItake his horseo. It was not like Dr. Holriiesto, have: unreasonable prejudices or indulge rediculous fancies.. He was. a plain, straightforward; sensible fellow, with. only, one romance in his whole life- he was thirty-five .when he married -and that was his love for his wife," Alice. But he took a violent. dislike to the new man at, sight. -All .thie : time he.wvas explaining how he came to be there, "Holmes watched his face. with coldi 'inlleasant ilooks, not at all lik hi lf_.t :' . .

The mali concerning whom he had had such dreadful auspicion and anxiety would never trouble him. more. He had given his life to save Fred Lester's children.; : There w.were:many there who .had known?~; Fred Lester; but no one sei~ied to recognize this: iman... His best friend indeed :would never have known.btha illekened and scared face. David'Holmes alone of all these. hues sed who the:dead man was, and lie. never uttered'his suspicion. Nothing further or in contradiction. of the report of Fred Loster's death years before ,-was ever heard. The stranger- with the .wooden- leg -was buried at Dr Holmes's expense; and the doctor and. Alice were quietly married over again on:some pretence of informality inthe, first ceremony, which his: wife never, questioned. David Holmes prospered. - He built him a new house, and was happy with the wife he-loved.so. But for years both his dreams ::nd his waking moments were haunted some times by the memory of that un happy man who .;had called himself Tom All-Alone to Fred Lester's chil dren, and had given his life to save theirs.
