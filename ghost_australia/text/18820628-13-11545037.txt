TEEAIJSTRALIA N ELEVEN IN ENGLAND. (IS ONE OF THE TEAM ) THE SUSSEX' MATCH, BRIGHTON, MAY 26. My last letter told you how we had won the Oxford University match, our first mate!; in England, and how hospitably entered we were by the Oxford cricketers. A also, that just after posting that letter on the 17th we were to leave for London by the 7 30 p m tram Well, we caught the train all right, and reached Euston square station at 10 o'clock from Euston square we drove to the Tavistock, our London quarters, stopping there for the night, caught the half-past 9 train next morning, the 18th, at London bridge for Brighton, where at noon the same day we had to commence our match against Sussex County After an agreeable trip in saloon carriages kindly provided for us by the railway superintendent at London bridge, we arrived at Brighton at 11 o'clock, and betook ourselves to Markwell's Royal Hotel, a capital place, with a frontage to the sea Selecting our rooms and " fixing ourselves a little, took UB up to half-past 11, and at that time we started for the County ground, distant a mile or so from our hotel The Brighton ground is not quite as large as that of the Melbourne Club and the turf is beautifully green, and kept in capital order all over The wicket in fine weather are considered second to none in England, and I can say that our fellows are prepared to vouch that they do not wish to and never have played upon a better pitch than that provided for this match The Rev Mr Greenfield, the Sussex captain, won the toss from Murdoch, and the weather being fine and the wicket in capital trim, we had to take the field The Sussex captain and Jilba were the first represents tives and Spofforth and Palmer took up the bowling The captain hit out merrily, and soon 30 runs were on the board Directly after the appearance of this number, Giffen, at square leg, splendidly caught Greenfield off Spofforth The South AUS tralian made three attempts at the ball before he finally held it, and he was loudly applauded for his successful efforts After the departure of their skipper the Sussex men shaped in very poor form against the howling of Palmer, who was in splendid trim, and before long they were all disposed of for the small total of 15, or at least 100 less than they expected to make Palmer, who by the way in this innings performed the hat trick, bowled in his very best form, and came out with the excellent figures of eight wickets for 48 runs Spofforth, too bowled well, but he secured only two wickets at a cost of 43 runs Our fellows fielded capitally, the only blot being an easy miss at mid on by Jones off Spofforth Jem Lillywhite spooned the ball, which fell into Jones bands and out again amidst laughter from all parts of the ground The usual interval having elapsed, Alick Bannerman and Massie went forth to face the bowling of our old friend Jim Lillywhite and Blackman The latter, who throws in an undisguised manner, was protested against by Murdoch when a few overs had been sent down, but the clergyman who captained our opponents said that Blackman a delivery was perfectly fair, and that he (the clergyman) would not take him off From the start Bannerman and Massie scored rapidly, especially the former, who, judging by his batting in this match, should no longer be termed the stonewaller You may note how quickly they Scored when I say that in 30 minutes from the start 00 tuna were made, and of this number there are no fewer than lb bite each for four At the end of the 35 minutes Massie, in hitting at the thrower, was held by Bettesworth at forward cover, 1-15-90 Massie hit viGor ously and was warmly applauded Murdoch joined Alick, and despite numerous changes in bowling, the runs mounted up until 120 was recorded At this stage, Alick hit Lillywhite hard to mid on and was capitally caught by Trevor 260 127 The little Sydneyite played a free and excellent innings and gave not the ghost of a chance Horan filled the vacancy, and stopped with Murdoch until the stumps were drawn, at half-past 0 Frequent changes were made in the bowling, 1st Murdoch and Horan negotiated them easily and safely, and caused 10 after 10 to appear, until at the close of the day a play the score stood at 274 for two wickets, Murdoch being not out 108 and Horan not out 41 Next day, at noon play was resumed and when 17 runs were added Horan was caught in the abos off the thrower 3-in 231 Horan played a good and steady innings, and was well received on returning to the pavilion Percy M Donnell next appeared on the scene but it was not his day out, for after making 11 he was bowled off his pads by HuruphrejB with an underhand Blow tour for 318 Blackham stopped with Murdoch until SSO was hoisted, and then our wicketkeeper, just at luncheon time had to retire 1 b w to Lillywhite i-27-JSJ Blackham showed sound cricket for his runs After luncheon Giffen went forth with Murdoch and a long partnership ensued The Adelaide representative playing in fine free and taking style scored rapidly and made several capital atrol es notably three miles each for 4 off Lillywhite in one over Murdoch too scored in good style and by and by 500 appeared on the board amidst applause Shortly after the hoisting of this man ber Giffen had to retire caught and bowled or rather caught and thrown by Blackman C-71-507 Giffen a innings was in every respect an excellent one and many com ple mentary remarks were passed on the pavilion on his attractive style and vigorous strokes "We were all very pleased to see the solitary Adelaide representative perform so well Jones, the new comer was caught in the slips when he had made and 7 for 124 was the record as Garrett joined Murdoch At fill the former was clean bowled in hitting at a slow, and Palmer filled the breach The South Melbourne crack muda 26 in capital style, and with Murdoch sent up the GOO Spofforth, the last man, was caught at cover after making 8, and the innings closed for 343 the largest score ever made in a first class match in England Murdoch carried his bat for the grand score of 281 He was at the wickets about seven hours, and gave only three chances one at the wickets one at point and one to Humphreja off his own bowling The crack batsman played in his beat form on the first day, and after luncheon on the second, but before luncheon on the second he seemed altogether abroad, and at this stage gave the chances mentioned His cutting was Al, and his off hitting ditto and his style evoked warm praise from all those assembled in the pavilion He was very heartily applauded on returning to the pay a lion The Sussex bowling was easy all through ; but for that matter so is almost any bowling on a first class wicket Our opponents fielded excellently Whitfield especially so He covered a lot of ground and saved many a boundary hit It was after 6 o'clock when the Sussex men started their second innings and when the stumps were drawn the score stood at 34 for no wickets and Greenfield made £7 of this number Next day at noon play was resumed and at 4 o'clock precisely. the innings terminated for the, leaving UB the victors by an innings and 3.5 runs Whitfield played an excellent innings for l not out, and so did Ellis for 52 Greenfield came next with a well played 31 Palmer bowled in splendid form and secured six wickets for 62 and at one time sent down 40 balls for only one run Garrett also bowled well The weather was delightful each day, but the attendance was rather limited, only about 3,000 being present the first day 2,000 the second, and 1 000 the third to-day at a quarter to six we said good bye to the gay and beautiful Brighton and were in London by 7 o'clock SUSS A COUNTY FIRST INNINGS SUOMI INMVOS R Ellis st Blackham b Palmer 12 b Garrett a F Greenfield, c Giffen, b So forth
