Saudy Maegragor-for auch we will call him-dismounted, and telling "the cabman to wait, disappeared up tbo narrow court. 'He was not gone more tlian ten minutes, and when he returned it was in company with a woman--a dirty,* dissipated-looking old woman, carrying a common paper-covered box. "This here's my old'oman misB ; an' if yerdon t object she shall ride inside with you. Here, hand us the box, old gal, and tumble insido wi' the young lady," So saying, ho put the box on the roof, and opening the door, motioned for tbe woman to enter. The young girl said not a word, but shrank up in the corner of (he cab, so as to make as much room as possible." " Wot's the time, Jim ? you've got a ticker." " Half-past three." " We must Bhove along, or we shall be late. Leadenhall Street, cabman, and whip up that 'ere animal of yours I" Then ho got on the other cab, and the two drove off, And pulled up outside a shipping office, nearly opposite the India House. Sandy Macgregor and his nephew pot down, and after reading the placards out side, announced tbe sailing of ships to all parts of the world, entered. "I say, deaV ; Jack-that in, Sandy-I call him Jack sometimes, you know ; but don't go for to tell him, or he'll whop me you haven't got a shilling in your pocket have you ?" Eulalie produced her purse. "I hare no silver," she said ; " but hero is a soverigo, if you wish it." The old woman eagerly took it. '. Thank you, dear! We shall bo first rate friends, I know ; only don't you toll my old man-he's such a temper! Don't you ever go for to cross him, or he'll give you Buch a hiding." Sal Macgregor-for that she s»id was her name-opened tho door and got out nimbly enough. After going a little distance, ehe came back, and putting her head in at the window, she said "I say dear ; will you come and have a drop of something ? you seem dull and lone some. A drop of nice ' Old Tom' now, will cheer you up." But Eulalie with an angry gesture refused, and tho old woman crossed over tho road, and ; dived into a public-house. "My heavens! what, a dreadful set I am thrown amongst! Surely, my father never could have intended I should be subjected to all this f Guide me,'heaven ! for I know not what to do." She cluBped her hands, and her lips moved in prayer, tears of shame and sorrow cours ing down her pale cheeks. " He will forgive me if I do wrong !" Then she got out of the cab, and walking quickly away, turned down a by- street. Bewildered, doubtful, torn by conflicting .motions, she scarcely knew what she was doing, but walked as it were instinctively away from those to whom she had beon con fided, and who had excited such horror and disgust in only one day. How she longed for human sympathy-for some one to advise and direct hor ; to strengthen her resolution, if she were doing right; to correct hor if she was doing wrong. But alaB ; she did not meet a friend ; and without difficulty found her way back to the cab. (To le continved. t
