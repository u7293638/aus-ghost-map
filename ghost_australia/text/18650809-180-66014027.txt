The men who drink the wine and; the men who make it know jBbS much of each other as if they lired in sepaVate planets,' and have as little cuinosliy -for mutual knowledge. Yet they might do worse than interchange a few notions; they might each learn a thing or two, and if it did not pull the rich man down, it inight help to pull the poor man up; of sootiZ; he wants it sorely. Life among the vines to those who have to live oatof the .vines is no joke. ;. L^ake it, more nonsense has been talked, among Englishmen at least, about vines aqd wine than any other subject, even politics.* We have had, it is true, the speeches oi senates and parliaments for the last two hundred years; but on the other hand have we not had Exeter Hall? The juice of the beautiful tree which Isaiah sang and Our Saviour blessed is an- abomination and a desolation, a nowling, and a curse to many, thousands of very werthy and parti cuiarly obtuse individuals. The common notion, on the other hand— I do hot say among colonists, for we are beginning all to£ ^u.pw_ something more or less about them, but among the stay-at-home English — is about as unfounded. Grapes to them are. the grapes of Co vent Garden; vineyards are Jong alcoves of green roofed over, mile upon mile, with pendant, clusters of grapes., and . vtgnerpns are picturesque groups of dark-eyed maidens in coquettish straw, hats and petticoats,, who are everlastingly bill ing, cooing, or dancing with romantic corsair- like youths in particoloured tunics. Here and there, and for a week or two, the notion verges on truth. The Italians, who do not as a rule, except in the north, trouble themselves much about anything, make very bad wine, but grow very good grapes, and their vineyards are really poetical, -though the, produce, is dubious. It is » great fact to turu in out of the blazing sunshine into the cool vhtas of the vines, and bask in the green twilight as in the «isles of a natural cathedral. It is a greater . to see a Roman or Neapolitan vintage, where from the large-eyed oxen which draw the car (the same beautiful cattle by-the-by, . from which Homer, gives to^aia goddess what must seem to northern readers the queer epithet of the cow-eyed) to the heaped-op fruit which clusters it, and ' the joyous group that with song and timbrel dances round it, the whole cortege seems .'as if it had stepped out of a feast of the Bacchantes two thousand years ago. Sot'tnen your Italian is not a vine-grower by -profession, and a wine-maker in a very small- sense, fie is a man of many small industries, so far as he condescends to be industrious,' and cares greatly more About maize than- vines, and aboutfsilk more than either of them. If his wine is good, it is by an accident. He makes it to drink, not to- sell. -Little Italian wine crosses the Alps. Some of it is good. Lachrymse Christi, profanely so Called, which grows only outhe, velcanic slopes of, Vesuvius, is superbly good, .but, portentiously dear. There is a first-class ; Tuscan wine, Monte pnlciaho, strong, clear, and. lasting, of great body land bouquet, which would be first rate, if the gentlemen and ladies who dance in the tubs to crush the juice out of the grapes would wash their feet first. Pied mont has- another' wine, Vino d' Asti good as champagne, and better, with an effer vesecent cream at the top, and a rich purple body below/ which would be an immense favourite -everywhere, could it be got at; but it cannot stand . a voyage. The old Roman wines, the Falernian, Massican, and Cdecuban, of which Horace atyd Virgil sang so copiously and fervently, are still to be had la places. Mr Bauer, the excellent landlord 'Of the Black Bear at Augsburg, who boasts of possessing the most extended collection, if not the ? greatest quantity, of wines in £urop9, having all kinds in his cellars- has, among the rest, some tolerable Falernian, which he pledges himself to be genuine. Horace calls it divine. I should call it average sherry, wiih a strong* infusion df treaclf, and a suspicion of tar. The Greek -wines, the children, as in Italy, of magnificent vinas, all taste of tar, and are to rfM Englishman thorough temperance drinks. The case is the same everywhere, The:riatage bowers of , song go with good gr&fie;& ami bad wines; the merry vintager of j poets and painters may be good to talk witfci, but, darigerooa to drink with.

The smiling peasant girls, with deep blue eyes, and hands that offer early flowers; never lived out of dreamland. A blue-eyed girl hardly exists on the Rhine, where the eyes are all black or brown? the womankind have copper skins tou«h as wash leather, and legs - like balusters; their garb is one of rags and patches; and though they certainly offer flowers, they always expect a shilling for a penny's worth, and are powerful in language when refused. The hawks and vultures circling the .mountain tops have long ago vanished, to give way to the vultures of the hotels and that -choice specimen of the Affable Hawk, a courier and guide, who will show you every thing for a considera tion, and always comes with the best of recommendations. Still, when die 'Childe Harold' Was written, things in some respect bore ? oat the . eloquent description, and the old dreams of romance lingered about the medusval river. The shriek of the locomotive and pant of the steam-engine were then unknown; the traveller drifted lazily down the current, seeing reach after reach opening and receding in mimic panoramas, with the primitive villages nestling strongly under the shadow of their feudal strongholds, vegetating quietly in utter ignorance of the outer world. It was very easy then to listen comfortably . to legends about ghosts and barons, peerless beauties and. spectre bridegrooms, demon hunters, gnomes, and CQlbolds, and all the machinery of legendary superstition which still lumbers up a genuine German brain. Who can believe in superstition now, seated in a bran-new hotel, with sodawater, lemonade, and English porter ticketed on the walla, and: waited on by a glib waiter of undeniable Cockney ism. ? The age for romance is past, and all that is left of vital interest in the Ehineland is the actual life of its- very curious population.
