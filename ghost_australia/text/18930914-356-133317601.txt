A MARTYR TO DUTY. ToE little band of Europeans who accom panied SrAnLEY in the expedition dispatched ostensibly for the rescue of Extxe PaeSLs. is becoming small by degreas and markedly less. Major BAInTELLOT was shot by one of his carriers. JAMEsoN died of fever, leaving a record of a dark deed in which he was impli cated behind him. Others have gone beyond the bourn from which no traveller returns, and Surgeon PARKE has now succumbed, doubtless, to the poison of African fever, which found its way into his system during the wretched journey which brought so little lustre generally on the British name. Writ ing on August, 1888, STANLEY, who was not given to paying compliments, writes thus to Mr. (afterwards Sir) WeIaLIAr M'rINsxon, whose death was recorded the other day : "At this time the hardest worked man in the expedition was our surgeon. Ever since leaving Fort Bode, in December, Surgeon PARKE attended over a hundred sick daily. I consider this expedition is nothing happier than in the possession of such an unrivalled physician and surgeon." Certainly it must have been a constant source of consolation to poor PARKe in his mortal illness that during the ill-starred expedition of which he was a member, and in the course of which so much blood was shed, his efforts were directed to saving, not destroying, human life, and that the ghosts of Africans who had died violent deaths had no reason to haunt him.
