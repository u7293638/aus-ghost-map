Mr. Wtite is the secretary of the Prahran Working men's Institute, and lhas a very wide local knowledge. In response to our inquiries, Mr. White indicated that hIe was a supporter of the of the Education Act in all its integral features. HIe did not favor the proposed introduction of Bible lessons into the schools with favor, holingg that it would be impossible to teach them with any good cffect, both because of the loek of interest on the part of the children, and of the division of opinion on the parents part. lie thinks, however, tihat the ten command mets ought to be incorporeated in the school books, and hung in. the buildings, and that eXaminations should take place upon them. He pointed out that Catholics, Protestants, and Jews were agreed as to the authenticity and value of thcse.commanad irents, with the excnetion of a few verbal disagreements as to the second commandl. He had found that a number of scholars and teachers were entirely ignorant of these.
