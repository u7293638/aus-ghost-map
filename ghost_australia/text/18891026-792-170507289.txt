ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. ENQUIBER.—The " Flower of the Holy Ghost" is a South American production. The flower is a creamy white cup, nearly as large as an egg, and extremely beautiful. What constitutes its extraordinary character and its wonder as a natural floral growth is the fact that in this flower is a little pure white dove, with pink bill and eyes, and its head turned as if looking over its back. Its wings, feet, bill, &c.;, are as absolutely perfect as those of the living dove, whose counterpart this wonderful minic vegetable bird is. READEB has not supplied us with his real name and address. SUBSCBIBER.—The report of a wedding should be sent to a society paper. CATHOIIICITT is making enormous progress in Bulgaria, where whole villages have been converted en masse.
