SYDNEY SIDEL&HTS.; 'Look here upon this picture and on this.' (By 'Vandorian.') - .. 'I believe I am the only young-woman in town that am in my own house at 10 o'clock to-night,' ?wrote Lady Mary .Wortley Montagu, on the evening of the famous masked ball at the Count Turrucca's mansion. ; ' 'He has : invited a few bare-faced,' says she, 'and the -whole town en ? masque.' . 'The 'whole town en masque! A small boy and myself were bare-faced 'on Thursday afternoon last. ' We had neither been invited en masque or b£re- faced to the great' ball. And as the tumble representatives of two big newspapers w[e wanted to know the reason why. He wanted to liaow, in: a document which set forth the wrongs and' indignities to which the Press had been subjected in his person! ' We k both wanted to find committee ladies at the Town Hall. Disquieting rumors had got abroad to the effect that one committee lady had elegantly intimated that sine didn't care a— the man who told the story said 'hang' — well, she didn't care anything whether the Press was represented or not. We waited, the S.B. and self, for that committee lady! We walked on the polished ballroom floor — chiefly because large notices strictly forbade it — and affected an air of .easy nonchalance. 'I'm waiting for her, too,' said he, waving his document. Flurried people darted through open doors, got up- ladders, got safely down (a matter of indifference to an indignant Press), swept up odds and ends of decorations, and took no notice of us. \- 'I don't -know her when I see her,'.' says S.B., Who is becoming weary.. Neither do I. This .is an obstacle. ! Another newspaper swoops down on the scene. He has never been treated so in his printed career — goes off more black than jfhite — looks dangerous — intimates that when committee ladies want paragraphs to advertise their charities they don't forget the Press. He becomes excessively gloomy, and sees no hope Eor ? any country in which committee ladies are allowed to exist, . - is sound on the question of Woman's Eufirag-e (hopes he may have ceased from report ing and be with the wicked at rest before it is per mitted), and goes off. \ Mrs. J. T.. Toohey and Mrs. Forbes- Angus ap pear, disclaim any personal. guilt in the matter of tickets, and are willing to help. Small boy and self are haughty and heartily tired of the whols thing. And the end of a- long afternoon's chase is this: We run the tickets to earth in an office in Hunter-street. They are concealed behind £lass doors and guarded by a gentleman who is unable to deny them. We saw them in a stack [-n a table. S. B.'s little legs ara tired; he is past words; gets his tickets, and goes. .' Self mumbles something disagreeable (fortunately for self not understood), gets tickets— goes. . Goes bare-faced to see the town en- masque. A.nd the town on Thursday, evening. looked gay, handsome, grotesque, and presented a . varied scene, so bewildering in its gorgeous coloring and swift movement that the columns already written might be supplemented by many more. In a little yellow tabernacle sat Lady Darley, Miss Darley, and Lady Harris to watch the pro cession. Here they come! And with the noise of every musical instrument that you can think of, trying to outblast every other, the posters en ter the Town Hall. ' Powder and patches. American gentlemen in Stars and stripes, a Greek soldier and Swiss pea sant, masks and- dominoes, a charming Mme. de Pompadour- (Mfss Bennett in crimson silk with a. great picture hat on her pretty head), geafemen Of rank and ladies of quality, pressed forward to see the show. Mrs. Forbes-Angus looked like a sweet little Dresden -china shepherdess (a la Watteau) as she stepped out of her Sedan chair — the kind of shepherdess who stands on one corner of an old fashioned country house mantelpiece, and is made love to (in- china) by a Wa1;teau shepherd in pink and sky-blue with lovelorn eyes to match. ^ 1 . The 'Evening News' and 'Town and Co'uh 'try' raised its head' high (in the person of Miss Clara Manning), and balanced its office on top of its head. The 'Town and Country' was repre sented by soft pink satin at the back with a stamped design. The bodice was 'Evening News,' the front of the skirt was 'Extra Special.' The latest telegrams were there, of course; but the electric light in the office (on Miss 'Manning's head) proved false to the 'Evening News,' went ?wrong in its battery, and left-- Miss Manning's head in total darkness. - ? ? Mrs. Brun ton's electric battery behaved bet ter. She .wore it opposite: her heart, and it lit up her tea-pot head dress. 'Ku, ku!' Two huntsmen in pink (Mr. George Terry and Mr. O'Callaghan) saunter past. Then comes a pretty girl in powder and . patches, a semi Gainsborough hat, semi-Gainsborough; dress,' and muslin fichu.. 'What are you?'. !'.{l':d6jL't .-quite know what I am,'' says she. 'You're... Miss. Rouse?'

'Won't you polk?' saye-a mysterious barrister, ?who is tall enough for a poster^ . 'What? not polk?' says he.- Or, 'Have, a polk,?',:. Se.says this at frequent intervals, :and it seems, to tie some kind of intermittent complaint, -which seizes him when- he 'sees'' me': 'Poik! -' ''What, not polk!' But lie is quite harmless, and the com plaint wasn't ? infectious; he went -his way. in peace, still murmuring, 'Polk!?1 ... : . And while many ladies looked very lovely at the poster ball, most men looked conscious— ^especi- ally conspxous-^of- their legs it they wore doublet and. hose ,that seemed too large. ./,'Shanks's ponies' are good servants, even if very' 'thin'; but seem to become masters in fancy dress, and' lead away their owners in. foolish revelry. , Mrs. J.

The garden party at Government House: Fri day afternoon was a little uncertain in its wea ther, until about 5 o'clock.. Then ifcbecame quite certain and rainejS. The blue hyacinths in the lawn beds had their pretty petals washed afresh, and bent their modest heads, beneath the falling rain.
