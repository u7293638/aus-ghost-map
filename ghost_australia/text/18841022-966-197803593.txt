Are vouisure V' : " Evety word. . Master, master'." answers Davey, but .cannot see. his master's face for tears. Geoffrey Stirling stretches himself upwards and backwards in Davey's arms. " I bare confessed—I do repent. Pray that God give ma peace." Bewildefred, amazed, thinking his dear old master still raves in delirium, Davey is tongue-tied* tear-blinded.. And s^iU all he sees of Hester is the white hand clutching the curtain till the curtain shakes and trembles. " It has bean, dragging me down, down to hell—the -.gold, 'Davey, the gold.that was not mine to take 1 The tears and crying .of the widow 9ad the orphan have been tearing at my heart,, maddening me, driving me to. despair; but now—I do confess, I do repent.

As Davey ooffies to her side she bends over it, raisea tne tfcick white folds that fill it, atnd In silence looks lat him. " What does thifl mean?" gasps Davey, a terrible 4ook <rf iear in his eyes, his heart beginning to labour in his breast.
