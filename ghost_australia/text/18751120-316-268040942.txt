The happy husband looks on with deep interest, and enjoys the fun immensely, apparently toping they will devour, reach other. Passing on to the time of sickness, a sick Fijian conceals his ailing,as longfas:he can, to escape tlie heartless, treatment which awaits ;him when, at length Ae. has . to> lie ;do»n:-3iei abandons himself ;to despair silent :as death, cand icoveri himself up with mats m the darkest corner of the liouse, nevsr askmgfor food lest lie should be upbraided as being a burden; • Sometimes if he- lingers very ..long a member of the family " is:appointed to strangle .01: club luui.
