' ? nOSS AND MEREDITH put in an appearance after a spell, and got through ono-and-thirty romids, when ' Mere dith gave up tho ghost. Tho fight was very slow, as both lads fought yory oarefully, wan derine round eaoh other in. cirolos, until at last thoir pants began to slip off. Ross had pants of a thinner material than the other chap, and when thoy split it was a good job ho was notvont fishing or ho might have returned a oouple of stone lighter than he went out. Both lads have a lot to learn, and it is a pity thoy did not make things a bit more willing, as the public, who virtually keop them, do not care to see two mon fool ing roundeaoh other for hours at a strotoh ; and if they had sot sail and won or lost, tho fight iu eight or ton rounds people wonld havo been muoh better pleased. ' Next Saturday night there will , bo ? some very willing slugging, and the people will of a surety see goro. ???.'?. .'?.'???.. ?; .'?'?..?,.'
