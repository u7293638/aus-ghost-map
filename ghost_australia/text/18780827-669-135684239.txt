CTo tho Editor of tho 1 lllawatra Mercurv -1 Sir,â€” As tho Borough Council of Central Il|a warra is about to romovo tho dilapidated structure on the Main Road, known as ' Ghost' Bridge for tho purpose of erecting a new one, it is ilcsfraWo in order to prevent accidents white the new worlt is being proceeded with, thut some better method should be observed in making the temporary mail way. The temporary bridge just completed (ot trap would be tho proper name for it) on the mm j ing is tho most flimsy apology that a person could I | possibly conceive, and tho approaches thereto are j only in keeping with tho so-called bridge. I think if my friend Alderman Richards, who, like myself is interested in having valuable horse toamsheavif; laden and constantly on tho road, were to direct ' his special attention to this matter, he would naturally feel some alarm as to tho risk of his horses, as well as to the danger in which human I life is exposed. If 110 better provision i3 ninth | for the large traffic on this road than that already provided, I fear that accidents will be a matter of daily occurrence. | , GEO. GSB0RKE.
