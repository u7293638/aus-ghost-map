To be sure, 1 Mr., Shacklord had been in htigationj with several of the corporations,-and-. had' had legal quarrels with mora than one of his ineighbours j . but Mr. Shackford. had' never been victorious m any of these con-: tests, and the' incentive of revenge waa wanting to explain the crime.. Besides,-itj wasEO clearly robbery; „ Though the gathering around the Shackford .house:-had reduced itself : to halt. -a doien idlers, and the lees frequented: streets-had resumed their normal .aspect :of dullness, there- was :a: strange: electric' quality in . the . atmosphere. . , The community was in that state of suppressed agitation and suspicion which no. ; word 1 •adequately describes-.-'- The slightest circumstance would have swaved, it to tie belief in any man's guilt; and indeed there were men m Stillwater quite capable Of disposing of a fellow- creature for a muoh smaller reward than Mr. Shackford had held out.

A pense of insecurity settled npon -Stillwater with tne falling twilight— that namclcse apprehension w^uch u possibly .-more -trying -to the. nerveB,: thaii tangible danger. When a man is smitten inexplicably, as if by a bodiless hand stretched outofacloud-^-whenthe red slayeij vanishes like a mist and leaves no faintest trace of his identity—the mystery shtouding the- deed presently becomes mofe a^p&Uiog; ihan .the deed' itself.
