AMADLOYE. BY BERTHA M. CLAY. CHAPTER LIIL— A Quarrel. iYom that hour all pretence of peace was at an end between them. Lady Chandos was justly indignant and wounded. If her husband had trusted her all might, even then, have been well, but he did not; he eaid to himself that she would forget the Btory of her annoyance in time, and all would be well : he did not erive his wife credit for the. depth of feeling that she really possessed. Fiercest, most cruel jealousy had taken deep hold of the gentle lady, it racked and tortured her ; the colour faded from her face, the light from her eyes ; she grew thin and pale ; at night she could mot sleep, by day she could not rest ; all her sweetness, grace, and amiability seemed to iave given way to a grave sadness ; the sound of her laughter, of bright words, died away; nothing interested her- She, who had never known a trouble or a care, aiow wore the expression of one who was heartbroken j she shrank from all gaiety, all pleasure, all parties ; she was like the ghost of her former self ; yet, after those words of her husband's she never spoke again of Madame Vanira. ? The sword was sheathed in her heart, and she kept it there. There js .no pain so cruel as jealousy, none iiiat so q\iickly deteriorates a character ; it Strings so many evils in its train : suspicion, envy, hatred of life, distrust to everyone and in everything; it is the most fatal passion that ever takes hold of a human heart, and turns the kindliest nature to galL There was bo moment during the day in which Lady Cliandos did not picture her husband with her rival; she drove herself almost mad with the pictures she made in her own mind. All the cruel brooding, the sullen pain, the hot anguish, the desolation, the despair of jealousy seemed to surge over her heart and soul like the waves of a deadly sea. If she saw her husband silent and abstracted, she said to herself that he was thinking of Madame Vanira ; if she saw him laugh and light of heart, she 6aid to herself he was pleased because he was going to see her. She had sensible and reasonable grounds for jealousy, but she was unreasonably jealous. Trifles, light as air, Are to the jealous confirmation strong' As proofs of holy writ. It was so with Lady Marion, and lier life at last grew too bitter to be borne. There was excuse f or^Lord Chandos ; the mistake was in renewing the acquaintance, a mistake that could never be remedied. People were beginning to talk; when 'Jjord Chandos was mentioned they gave significant smiles. Against Madame Va nira there had never 'been even the faintest rumour of scandal ; but a certain idea was current in society — that Lord ChandoB ad mired the queen of song. ISTo one insinuated the least wrong, but significant smiles fol lowed the mention of either's aaxoe. ?Madame Vanira «ras at Lady Martyn's last night,' one would say. ' And the laughing answer was always : *Then Lord Chandos was not very far away.' ' La Vanira sang to perfection in .*? Rdelio,' ' one woald.remark. t Another would answer : *liord Chandos would inowinowto jbhj plaud.* ? Madame Vanira was more eagerly sought lifter than any other woman in London. She rejgned qaeen, aot^only over the stage, but Over the world of fashion also. ~ ? . TherCountess of Eastern gave a grand ball — -jt was the most exclusive of the season. After much praying, Madame Vanira had promised to go, and Lady Chaaidos was the belle of the ball. They had not met since the evening on wMchjnadame had euiig for her, and Lord Chandos had many an anx ious thought as to -what their nest meeting would be like. He knew that Leoiie would bear much for his gake, yet he did not know what his wife would be tempted to Bay. They met on the night of Lady Easton's ball; neither knew that the other wafl coming. If JjaBy Chandra had dreamed of meeting Leone there 'she would not 'have gone. As it was, 'they met lace- to face in the beautiful ante-room^foat led to the*ball room. Face to face, Leone Wfxre tk «uperb dress ; of pale amber brocade, and Lady Chandos a beautiful costume *£ pale 4»lne velvet, the long train ^fi-piioa wW^^ened flrijih white' JRinim? pearls. M It was like the meeting of lasal queens. Leone's fgcB £ndggl, &a;&f; Jlarionfc grew deadly pale. Leone Jield out 3ier hanS — Lady Marion declme^lboseeit.

'No; I decline tb touch yoor hand,' said Lady Chandos ; ' I decline to speak to you. after this.' ' Will you tell me why ?\ asked Leone. . Lady Marion's face flushed -crimson. ' Since you ask me, I will tell you. You have been seeking my husband, and I do not approve of it. You spent a day with him on the river — he dever told me about it. I am not a jealous wife, but despise any woman who would seek to take the love of a husband from his wife.' Conscience, ?which makes cowards of us all, kept Leo^e silent. Lady Chandos continued : ' What is there between, my husband and you?' * Trne friendship,' said Leone, trying to speak bravely. ...-.' I do not believe it,' said Lady Chandos ; 'true friendship does not hide itself or make mystery of its actions. Madame Vanira, I loved you when I first saw you ; I take my love and my liking both from you. I believed in you when I first saw you ; now that I find you have acted treacherously, I believe in you no more.' * Those are strong words, Lady Chandos,' said Leone. *They are true; henceforth we are stran gers. My friends are honourable women, who would sooner steal my jewels than seek to steal from me my husband's love.' Leone could have retaliated, the tempta tion was strong ; she could have said : ' He was my husband, as I believed, before he was yours — yon. stole him from me, not I from you.' The temptation was strong; the words leaped in a burning torrent from her heart to her lips ; she repressed them for his sake, and bore the crushing scorn of lier beautiful rival without renlv. 'I have always heard,' she said, *that there was ample reason why singers, even though' they be queens of song, should not be admitted into the heart of one's home ; now I see the justice of it; they are not satisfied with legitimate triumphs. You, Madame Vanira, have not been content with my 1-iVJ- ng1 aaid friendship, with, the hospi tality of my home, but you must seek to take my husband's interest, time, affection.' * Are you not judging me harshly, Lady Chandos ?' asked the beautiful singer. *You bring sU these accusations against me, and give me no opportunity of clearing myself from them ?' * You cannot,' said Lady Chandos. * I have no wish to hear your defence ; you can neither deny nor explain this fact, that you spent a day with my husband on the river ; all the sophistry in the world cannot do away with that fact, and that fact con demns you.' ' Would yon say €ixe same thing to any of your friends ?' asked v Leone — * to Lady Galdwell or Lady Blake ?' * if either of them would do such a thing/ cried Lady Chandos. * Ladies of the class to which I belong do mot spend whole days with gentlemen unknown tq their wives. Madame Vanira, you and I are strangers from bow.' ' You are very hard on me, Lady Chandos,' said Leone; * the day may come when you will admit that.' ' The day will never come on which I shall mistake good for evil, or right for wrong,' said Lady Chandos. * Others may applaud you; you may continue your sway over the hearts and minds of men; but I shall protest against you, and all those like you, who would come.oetween husband and wife to separate them.' It was Euch a satire of fate, such s mock ing satire on her own life, athat .Leone's beautiful lips curled with a bitter smile. It was she who 'had been parted from her husband by a 'wretched quibble of the law, and this fair, angry woman had taken him for herself. Lady Chandos saw the smile, and misun derstood it. She bowed and would have passed, but Leone tried ito stop her. * Will you not eay one kind word to me before you go, .Lady Chandos ?', -she asked. 'Hxawe not one 3dnd word to- eay/ was; ike -brief reply, ? .''.; She would have passed on, but fete again intervened in the shape of Lord Chandos, who was walking -with -Mb hostess, the Countess of Eastern. They ©topped before the two ladies, and Lord Chandos saw at once that something was 'wscong. Madame-; Yanira, after exchanging a Jew words with ihe countess, went away, and, jaesopn as he conld; Lord Chandos .rejoined bis wife. ' -♦Marion,' be said, curtly, * you have bad : some disagreeable . /words wath Madame Vanira.

She turned her fair face proudly to Mm. 'Ibave dared,' she replied; *I refuse to see or speak -to Madame Vanira, again-— she mast not across the threshold of my door again/ Lord Chandos gresr deadly pale as be heard ihe-words. * And I say. £ba£ you -wrong a good and blameless Trojuaii, USsinovu 3vh.en you. say yucb. ^rojeds/ , ^Myioi^,pmS.pta,v^InotatB^tijio jjbot^gnyfraendjBy yhfijagked, 3iM\ghts?jjy. ; .^Pertalaty f$*L*u& flSrffbpriy 4o &o; just *S§ron pleSfee Sal Hbat seapeeV be replied.

Then Lady Chandos had her carriage called and went home. CHAPTER LIV.— A Mother's Appeal. ' She would not bear it — she could not bear it J' that was Lady Marion's conclusion in the morning, when the sunbeams peeping in her room told her it was time, to rise. She turned her face to the wall, and said it would be easier to die — her life was spoiled, nothing could give her back her faith and, trust in her husband, or her love for him. Life held, nothing for her now. It was noon before she .rose, -and then she went to her boudoir. Lord Chandos bad gone out, leaving no message for her. She sat there thinking, brooding over her sorrow, wonder ing what she was to do, when the Countess of Lanswell was announced. Lady Marion looked up. It was as though an inspiration from heaven came to her ; she would tell Lady Lanswell, and hear what she had to say. 'You have been crying, Marion,' said the countess, as she bent over her daughterin law. ' Crying, and how ill you look. What is the matter ?' * There is something very wrong the mat ter/ said Lady Marion.- * Somethingthat I cannot bear ; something that will kill me if it is notEtopped/ ' My dearest Marion/ said the countess, ' what is wrong ; I have never seen you so distressed before. Where is Lance ?* ' I never know where he is now,' she said, 'Oh, Lady Lanswell. I am so miserable, so unhappy, that I wish I were dead/ This outbreak from Lady Marion who was always so calm, so high bred, so reti cent in expressing her feelings, alarined Lady LansweU. She took the cold, trem bling frfl.Tiffa in her own. 'Marion/ she eaid, 'yon must calm your self ; you must tell me what is the matter, and let me help you,' Lady Chandos told her all, and the coun tess listened in wondering amaze. ' Axe you quite sure ? ghe said. * Lady XLfield exaggerates sometimes when she re peats those gossiping stories/ * It must be true, since my husband owned it himself, and yet refused, to give me any explanation of it. Sometime since I found that he passed so much of his time away from borne, I asked you if he hadany, friends with whom be was especially intimate, and you thought not. Now I know that it was Madame Vanira he went to see. She lives at Highgate, and he goes there every day.* ?* I should not think too much of it, my dear, if I were you/ said the countess. 'Madame Vanira is very beautiful and very accomplished-^- all gentlemen like to be amused.' * I cannot argue,' said Lady Chandos ; ' I can only say that my own instinct and my own heart tell me there is something wrong, that there is some tie between them. I know nothing of jt — I cannot tell why I feel this certain conviction; but I do feel it.' * It is not true, I am sure, Marion,' said the countess, gravely. * I know Lance bet ter than anyone else ; I know his strengtb, bis weakness, his virtues, bis failings. Love of intrigue is not one, neither is lightness in love/ 'Then, if i.e cares nothing, for Madame Vanira, and sees me unhappy over her, why will he not give her up ?' * He will, if you ask nim/ said Lady Lans well. 4 He will not. I have asked bun. I have, told frfrn that the pain of it is wearing my life away, but he will not. I am very un iappy, -for Iflov© my husband/ * And he-lbves you,* said the countess. c I -do not think so. I believe — my in stinct tells me — that be loves Madame Vanira/ 'Marion, it is wicked tov«ay such things/ said the countess, severely. * Because your 'husband, like' eyery other man of the world, pays some attention to the most: gifted -woman of her day, you suspect him of infi delity, want of love, and want; of truth. I wonder at you.' _: . . , , Lady Mptiota raised her iair j tear -stained ?face. '. ? .' ' ' .'???.? .

She did not love the earl well enough to be jealous jof -»tti ; she did not understand love or jealousy in others. She sat now quite helpless before the unhappy wife, whose grief annoyed her. 'This will not do/ Marion/ she said; 'You will make yourself quite ill/ ' 111 !' repeated Lady Marion; * I have been ill in heart and soul for many days, and now I am sick unto death. I wish I could die — life has nothing left for me/ ?'* But, my dear child, it seems such a trifle — such a trifle ; one day spent together on a river. Is that anything for you to die about?' The sweet blue eyes .raised wistfully to hers were full of pain. * You do not see— yon do not understand. Only think bow much, intimacy there must have been between them before he would ask her to go, or she consent to spend a day with him. If they are but strangers, or even every day friends, what could they find to talk about for a whole day ?' The countess shrugged her shoulders. ' I am surprised/ Ehe said, ' for I thought Madame Vanira so far above all coquetry. If I were you, Marion, 1 would forget it.' ' ' I cannot forget it/ she cried ; ' would to God that I could I It is eating my heart away '.' ' Then,* said my lady, ' I will speak to Lance myself, and I am quite sure that at one word from me he will give up the acquaintance, for the simple reason that you do not like it/ And with this promise the countess left her daughter-in-law. Once before, not at her bidding, but by her intrigues, she had persuaded him to give up one whom he loved; surely a few words from her now would induce him to give up one whom he could not surely love. It never occurred to ber to dream that they were the same. She saw hi™ as she was driving home, and stopping the carriage, asked him to drive with her. * Lance, I have something very serious to say to you. There is no use beating about the bush. Marion is very ill, and very unhappy.' ' I am. sorry for it, mother, But add also that die is very, jealous and very foolish.' * My dear Lance, your wife loves you — you know it ; she loves you with all her Leart and souL If your friendship with Madame Vanira annoys her, why not give it up?' * I choose to keep my independence as a man; I will not allow anyone to dictate to me what friends I shall have — whom I shall give up or retain.' ' In some measure you are right,. Lance/ said the countess ; ' and, so far as gentle men friends are concerned, I should always choose Eiy own; but as this is a lady o£ whom Lady Marion has certain suspicions, I should mostacertainly give her up/ *My wife has no right to be jealous/ he said, angrily; 'it does not add to my love for her/ ' Let me speak serioi^ly to you Lance/ said the countess. ' Marion is so unhappy that I should not wonder if she were really ill over it ; now, why not do as she wishes ; Madame Vanira can be nothing to you — Marion is everything. Why not give her up?' A certain look of settled determination that came upon her son's face made the countess pause and wonder. She had seen it there for the first and last time when she had asked her son to renounce his young wife, and now she .saw it again. Strange that his next words should seem like an answer to her thoughts. * Mother/ be said, *do not ask me; you persuaded me to give up. all the happiness of my life years ago — do not try me a second time. I refuse, absolutely, to gratify my wife's foolish, jealous wish. I say, empha tically, 'that I will not give up my friendship ,for Madame Vanira/ Then my lady looked fixedly at him. -* Lance/ she said, sternly, 'what is Ma dame Vanira to you?' JB.e could not help Uie flush that burned his handsome, angry face, and that flush, aroused his mother's curiosity. *Haye you known ber long? ©id you inowr her -before yonr marriage, Lance ?
