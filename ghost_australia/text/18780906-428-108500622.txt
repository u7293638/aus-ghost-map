Awhile thou stoodest Baffled and.gloomy; then thou didst sum up The elements of all that thou didst kriojr; Tho changing seasons, winter's leidless reign, The b'udÂ»;ing'o'f'the heaven- brenthing trees, The eternal orbs that beautify tho night, Tlio sun-rise, and the sotting of the moon, Earthquakes and wuiv, and poisons and disease, And all their causes, to an abstract point Converging, thou didst give it name, and form, Intelligence, and unity, and power. -Shelley.
