Laying a Ghost. A large and fashionable party were staying at a country house. The hostess, obliged to put someone in the haunted room, chose a single parson, and never told him. Every morning after, host, hostess,- and guests inquired diligently as to how he had slept. After the third morning he l'equested an explanation from the host of so much solicitous inquiry after his slumbers. Host explains that the room was reported to be haunted by an ancestor.-Parson : "What sort of a man was he?" Host: "Country gentle man; old-fashioned costume." Parson: "I saw him the first night. I slept there. I jumped out of bed, went to my coat, and got my subscription list, and seeing he was a perfect gentleman, I said, We are re-building our new schools, may I have the pleasure of adding your name, sir?' He vanished, and I have never seen him since." . *
