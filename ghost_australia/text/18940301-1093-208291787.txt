AMUSEMENTS. This evening the Bijou Theatre will be re opened by the Garriek Dramatic Club, who will appear for a short season of three nights, giving a change of programme each evening. This evening's bill will consist of "Ruth's Romance," "A Bed of Roses," and "A Regu lar Fix;" and as there are a great many country visitors in town there will doubtless be a well filled house. A well-filled house welcomed Mr. "Walter Bentley, Miss Isabel Webster, and their com-, pany at the Semaphore Town Hall on Wednes day evening. The programme presented was the same as that gone through at the Adelaide Town Hall-on Monday. The various items were all so happily rendered that applause was frequent. An entirely new programme will â€¢be presented in the Adelaide Town Hall this evening, when the last opportunity of hearing the present combination will be afforded. j The Cyclorama of the Battle of Waterloo! still continues to attract large numbers of j visitors daily, the beautiful and interesting picture of the battlefield, together with the additional attractions of Napoleon's ghost and the enchanted fountain being a eource, of never-ending enjoyment. During the next three days the Cyclorama should be visited by excursionists from the country. The Wanderers' Tourist Party will give a performance at the BijouTheatreon Saturday, March 10, in aid of the Children's Hospital.
