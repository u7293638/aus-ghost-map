Last Thursday a complete change of country came in, the formation carrying two splendid walls and a seam of quartz, which occurred about the centre, full of dark iron pyrites and a little gold. This satisfies me that we are on the right track, and may expect better things when we get under the tunnel whcra the rich gold was found. In the tunnel the reef can be traced for over 200ft west without a break. Everything is now in good working order; am now work. ing two shifts.
