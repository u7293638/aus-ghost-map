LYCEUM THEATRE. Second to Shakspeare's great misterpieces. the i dramas of Mr. Sheridan Knowles mar claim a place, if not a preference, and certainly one of) the least meritorious of them i= no; the play of the j "Hunchback." It was presented ye=terd:\y ever;- j ing to a numerous audience at the Lyctu:n. ir. a very complete and efficient manner, llr. Wa;nvr ? rendering the part of Matter Waiter, the Hunch back, in a way that were his acting always up to the Fame high standard-we are aware of no legi timate reason why it should not be-could not fail to. render him a general favorite. Mrs. Hill's representation of Jalin, his daughter, was highly creditable. This lady's acting has improved very remarkably of late, and last night, espe cially, ber impassioned acting in the inter view with Master Walter, prior to her marriage with the Earl, to whom she was yet a stranger, won from the audience frequent tokens of approval. Mr. Cox, as the Sir Thomas Clifford of the piece, was from first to last satis factory. The same may be said of Mr. Hill and Mrs. Cox, in the characters of the inexperienced Hodtu and his coquettish cousin Heltn. The. second and concluding part of the even ing's programme, by the Lancashire Iiellringers, TTa= undoubtedly that which attracted so large an audience. The Beilrinzers gave several of their choicest pieces-" The Blue Hells of Scotland," " The Princess Alexandra's Wedding March," "The Chimes," and the "Irish Quadrilles." Ma ster Weston played several solos, and Miss Chalker gave " Kathleen Mavourneen," and be ins loudly encored, the solo from Midsummer Xijrbt's Dream, " Hid me discourse." This evening, Mr. Warner appears as Tom Trumper, in " Fraud and its Victims," the per formances to conclude with " A Ghost in spite of himself."
