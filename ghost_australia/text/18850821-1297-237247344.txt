THE " ROLL CALL." TO THE EDITOR OR THE DAILY TELEORAnt. Sir, — Mr. Ashton in his letter in your issue of to-day sets forth with tho intention of " con- tradictiug two or three statements in my lotter;" hut I fail to soe when or where any ono of the contradictions comes -in. I, howevor, accent his disclaimer that he is not inimical to the trustees of the Art Gallery, hat decline to acoept his assertion that he was the first to draw- attention to the absence of the signature to tho pioture in question. . It needed not a ghost from Hades to toil us what was palpable to everybody. Those who hovo followed the cm-rosp'ondonco on this much-writ ten -upon sub ject unit remember that immediately on yoqr cablegram appoaring Mr. Sands wrote von on tho subject, as also did the hon. secretary of the Art G_allerr, who, as it appears to rac, very clearly sot forth tlio reason w-hy the money was not paid upon dolivory of the picture — namely, the abscnco of siguaiure. With Mr. Asnton, I agree thnt "Wedded" should bo signed, also Mr. Suut's picture. A guarantee is a good card, but a signature is 'a Better. — Yours, Bio., THOMAS F. CURTIS. Bay view, Bine s Point. .
