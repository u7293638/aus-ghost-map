Por theso reasons he intimated Ina intention of opposing the second reading of the bill ne would not do this in any spirit of factious opposition for he would be glad to support the Ministry if he could do so He concluded by expressing his belief that no single member of the Assembly would be iniluenced by the threat that had been held out to them of a dissolution if the bill were not paased He trusted that the Govern- ment would Bee their way to modify the bill, and would also revise the tariff, with a view of relieving the working claBseB of a portion of the taxation which preeeed so heavily upon them at preaent At the concluaion of Mr Tucker a address, Mr Batey moved the following reaolu tion - "That tills meeting condoning tim Reform Dill of tho Servico Govcrûment as an infringement of tim rights of tho peoplo of this country ' Mr. CniBP, president of the Titzroy Reform League, seconded the motion, which was carried with two dissentients Another resolution, approving of the posi tion taken up by the representatives of 1 ltz roy in opposing the Government bill, was also carried, and a vote of thanks to tho chairman was carried on the motion of Mr M'Kean, M.L A MEETINC AT HOTHAM A meeting waa held m the Hotham Town hall under the auspices of the local reform league last night to consider the Government scheme of reform About 500 were present, and Mr T Arnott the mayor, occupied the chair Amongst those on the platform were 15 members of the league Several members of Parliament wero expected, but they had not arrived when the meeting opened Mr T K Scott moved the following reso lution - "That this mooting emphatically condemns tho reform sclirmo Introduced by tho Servico Government for lho loillowlng reasons -1 That its provisions, if carried into lau, would hand over tlio rlchlB of tho populor Chamher, and destroy »hat has over bsen claimed by the Houso of Commons, vi?..
