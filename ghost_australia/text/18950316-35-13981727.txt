j- ART NOTES. A London correspondent sends us the follow- ling -In the present exhibition of the Dudley Gallery Art Society in London, he says, there are two interesting drawings by Mr Dorofiold Hardy, a cousin of Mr Norman Hardy, the well-known artist of the Sydney Mail There is also a drawing entitled "Margaret's Ghost," of exceptional merit, by another cousin of Mr Hardy's, Mr. Cecil Hobson, lately a student at the South Ken- sington Art Training School This poetical draw- ing is founded on the Unca by Mallot describing the appearance to her lover of the ghost 01 Margaret - Her face was like an April morn, Clad in a wintry cloud The president, Mr Walter Severn, who has proÂ« sented pictures to some of the Australian galleries, exhibits some very large landscapes of scenes in Skye, Knoydart and other parts of the west coast of Scotland Mr Fletcher Watson is well represented by three drawings of cathedral interiors The largest of these, which shows a religious festival in Burgos Cathedral, is a very fine and impressive work, and is deservedly placed on the line Mr Percy V S Spence, the clever young Australian artist, leaves Sydney by the BIS. Australia on 11th April, to try his fortunes in the old world Mr Spence s many friends in the art world predict for him a successful career A number of the artist's pictures are being disposed of by- an art union, which is to be drawn on 10th April Mr Theodore Watts, in his reminiscences of Christina Rossetti in the last Nineteenth Centm y, mentions a curious instance of her brother a state of mind during the last years of his life. He had lapsed into such a condition of despondency that he imagined he would never paint again, and the moment he touched a brush his hand shook as if with palsy, and the brush fell from his fingers By a stroke of strategy they as worked him up into a discussion as to hear AV B Scott looked without a wig, whereupon he went to his easel and made a sketch rapidly and perfectly next day Miss llossotti asked him to paint her portrait in chalk, as when he declared he could not hold the chalk, whereupon the Scott portrait was shown him, and he at once found himself able to do a most successful likeness of the poetess Herr Richard Mother, keeper of the Royal Collection of Prints at Munich, and his publishers, Messrs Henry and Co , propose to issue their popular "History of Modern Painting" at a popular price There will be 30 numbers, and the whole will consist of over 2300 pages and 1300 illustrations The Athenaeum is informed that the frequent robberies of artistic and antiquarian treasures which have been going on for some time from the mosques and other buildings in Constantinople have been traced to a dealer, who was caught in the act of sending off several stolen Kerans and MSS An interesting collection of Mr G T Cole- ridge's water-colours was to be exhibited by the fine art publishers, Messrs Frost and Reed, at Clifton early in February The pictures were chiefly transcripts of English scenery many of them on or near the Thames The exhibition of Chinese Blue and White at the Burlington Fine Arts Club opened on 4th February The V es1 mean Ga letter in an account of the exhibition, says Both at South Kensington and at the British Museum there are collections of blue china for which are never likely to be surpassed in their way It would be impossible to find more brilliant specimens than there are in the first, nor is there anywhere a larger number of typical examples than in the second But there was ample room, in spite of these two classical shows, for bringing together some of the very fine specimens which have found their way into private collections during these last few years This has now been done with quite remarkable success by the Burlington Fine Arts Club, whose exhibition with their catalogues Meissonier have during recent years been indispensable to the art student Anyone who chooses to spend a few hours in the present show, giving careful attention to his catalogue, may learn pretty nearly all there is at present to learn about old Nankin blue china, and if he is ambitious to buy even on a small scale he may also do not a little to train his taste If an intending collector eau got access to the Burlington Club, and it he will afterwards refresh his memory at South Kensington, he may save himself much trouble hereafter, for in the club gallery there are specimens of almost every 1 md, and nearly all of are of their kind the very best Most of the great collectors have lent, including Lord Battersea, Mr Salting, and Mr. Huth and numerous beautiful examples are brought together from the smaller collections Best of all, they are so arranged that like can be compared with like audsomejudgmentformodupoutha difficult subject of dates On the left as you enter the room (continues the JJ estimates are some notable examples of what may be considered "primitives ' Here is one of the four famous pieces lately sold from the Burghley collection, and said to have been continuously in the possession of the Cecil family since the days of Queen Elizabeth which, if true, should identify it as one of the earliest pieces of Europe But there are several others which have a more obviously archaic appearance-e g , No 2, n saucer-shaped dish of course paste, as 4th its rude draw ing of birds and primitive use of the prunus or hawthorn decoration It would be easy from specimens here to make out an apparent sequence in the evolution of the hawthorn form this early form to the presumably Into forms in case C, with their elaborate white upon blue and realistic drawing of detail These last seem to us in pure beauty to represent the highest point reached by the Chinese decor for in blue and white But the effort to date there would be mostly quite arbitrary, and from the dates which the pieces carry it is impossible to make out any such devolopment in Chinese art as one expects from the European analogy Here are plants which seem positively of the latest type dated a hundred years earlier than the primitive we have just mentioned. Again, there are a pair of long necked bottles in case B (C), with a symmetrical and almost classical design, which bear the Souou till mark (1426-36). lins pretension is not questioned in the catalogue, but it is almost concert able on any theory of art development that it could have been a hundred years earlier than the circular vase with the a silo v fish on the glaze (1), which is dated 1122 1567 But the catalogue is throughout most unsettling to the student, the truth being, as stated in the introduction, that the history of Chinese porcelain is a history of endless imitation The later artists, indeed, prided themselves on imitating old designs of any period, marks and all, in such away as to deceive the very elect of connoisseurs The successful imitation, moreover, was not considered a fraud, but a triumph of skill, and it hold its own in a market with the original If these were Chinese ethics in dealing with Chinamen, it is not to be expected that greater mercies should be shown to " foreign devils " The "foreign devil," therefore, who tries to date his blue, is reduced to guess- work, unless, as in the case of the Burghley bowl, the piece has an independent European pedigree The house in St John's Wood road which was for so long tenanted by Sir Edwin Landseer and afterwards by Mr. H. W. B. Davis, R A , has been razed to the ground, and the extensive grounds are a waste of desolation It is also used by the Manchester and Sheffield railway as a coal depot' Mr Strang has completed a series of illustrations to the "Pilgrim's Progress " and these are now being published by Messrs Nimmo The opening of the Indian Empire Exhibition at West Kensington is now definitely fixed for Saturday, 11th May Sir James Linton has got together a large and interesting collection of Indian relics and historical pictures, and native as workmen of all sorts are to be shortly sent over by the Gaekwar of Baroda, the Maharajahs of Bhnu sugar, Travancore, and Kolhapur, and other Indian potentates who take a deep interest in the scheme Lords Cranbrook and Roberts, Sir Peter Lumsden, Sir W W Hunter, and many other leading authorities on Indian affairs, have recently joined both the honorary committee and the committee of advice It has been suggested that a wholly novel acts motion might be provided in the Maharajahs would send two or three representative soldiers from each of their native restroom to London, as well as the craftsmen, some of whom will soon be on their way
