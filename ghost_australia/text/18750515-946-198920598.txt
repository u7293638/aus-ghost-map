f BARBARA'S ROMANCE. ?'?'?-' Barbara Oremorne turned away from the dingy hotel window, with .a sup pressed sigh.

He caught her hands in his, and held them fast in spite of her struggles. 'What right? Will you hear me tell you?' ?;? .She saw his eyes move now, as once before, looking straight/into her own, but they had lost their old repose, and burned like opals in their, passionate splendor. Barabara's white face crim soned slowly beneath the gaze he bent on her. . '. . ,/ 'I have the right because I love you.

They were both standing close by the window— she made an attempt to secure ' the key, as he held it' swinging from his forefinger. He put his arm out of the window.

Standing opposite her, his face rigid |. and unbending* he went on rapidly. , ' Let me tell you my story. It . has . has never yet passed my lips to mortal being— it is too distressing a theme, for mo to care to dwell upon it — but because . you are listening I shall not dread the pain its recital may call into existence. ' I was borne twenty-nine years ago, in the northern part of Georgia. My mother was .a slave, though lawfully married fo my father, who was an over ? seer from Connecticut. She was a fair, beautiful woman, gentle and ladylike in her manners, and for this reason, perhaps, she was kept constantly as a servant about the person of Mrs St ? . John, her mistress. She brought me up imbued with ideas far above my class. I had aspirations after goodness and greatness winch no slave ought to . have, unless he ?? can stand beneath the goading lash like a hero and a stoic. , My wretched condition galled me. I felt that a man was a free agent, and I longed for my own freedom. When I was fifteen, my mother died, It was said that the hand of violence hastened ? her death, but then. I did hot know it. Now I know that because, of a slight act ... . of. dispbedience:to her master, my mother was whipped publicly,, and the disgrace and sliame killed her. If I. had known it at the time, as God liveth, I would .have sent that man to his account, though my own neck had felt the halter, . in return ! But I did not know it. I was at work on a distant plantation at the time, and returning home, I found my mother dead. I was told that she . had died of ji marsh-fever, which was. then prevailing. My father was already dead, and the. last, tie was riven that . bound me to that land. My resolution, was taken. I made- all my preparations' silently, confiding my intentions ,to no ' one, and one dark night I stole my freedom and ran away. I will not weary you by particulars ; let it suffice to say that I went to Australia. Gold wbb plenty there ; I was an active, enterprising boy. I entered into business, first on a small scale, increasing as my means would allow. I was suc cessful ; I became wealthy, and in conse quence men respected me. There are some natures, you know, whose esteem can only be won by the touch of the ma^ieal golden wand. And of such, at that time, was the community of Australia. if.' But I must hasten . on. One day I received an American letter. My 'retreat had been discovered. It was from Colonel St John, my former master. Its contents astounded me. It proved to me the welcome fact that I was not, that I bad never been, a slave, although the brand of my nominal owner was on my wrist. , Rizpah, a favourite house hold servant of Colonel St John, had died some months before, and on her death bed she made a strange revelation. Mrs St John had never been blessed' ' with but one child, a daughter, . Rizaph- had a daughter also, at about the same time. I suppose it is needless to. say that both children had the same father ; such occurrences are leniently looked' upon among pur southern aristocracy. Rizpah was of an exceedingly jealous naturo, and she conceived the wild plan of changing the infants, and securing to her own child the inheritance-of : the family name and fortune. This she successfully accomplished, and my mother, the legitimate child of 'Colonel St John and his wife, was brought upi slave, ' '. /?;'.' .' :. : ? ? -'. ..'..?': ' .. ? ?
