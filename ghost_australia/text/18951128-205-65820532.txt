Lost Opportunltie. - There is no possible "might have been of life's history so sad as the op portMnity, lost forever, of being kind to somebody who is dead. There is as sorrow that can match the sorrow of a heart which' recognized too late that it might have been more kind and loving to one whom God hath taken. There is no tear among the many which menr tal eyes might shed which can bltde: and corrode like the tears that fall whe remembering harsh words spoken of tender caresses withheld. ItiL soasmal a thing to say a pleasant word instead of a cross one, or togive a smile in plsee of a frow, and yet how strangely reti cent we are in such matters. "Oh, she knows I love her; I can't be bothering to say so all the time l' says the huse baud, and meantime the heart of lie wife craves the word that is neve. spoken, until its echo comes likes ghost to haunt the memory when death has forever removed love's opportunity. It is so little we can really do for onc another in the march of life. We are all under marching orders, and have bprdeps to carry. There is no halt f't nondcay dreams nor twilight rest. It is; step, step, step-right onward through dust and commonplace, with out music or banners or present glory, and yet to each soldier has been gives a canteen full of never- failing water, a cup of which we may proffer with no tear of a diminished store all the way through to the end of the long marcb to the sea. Is our comrade discouragedl Do his feet fail and his hands grow heavy? A cheering word, a loving servire, a friendly suggestion, born of the desire to help and encourage, will revive him like sparkling water in the desert heat. Such things cost nothing, but not all the gold and diamonds yon could pack into your bundle would match them for solace on the long and dusty march that stretches for each one of us between the cradle and the grave.
