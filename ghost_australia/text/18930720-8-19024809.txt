Saved by a Ghost. ' I tell the tal» as it was told to me. There had been a period of distress among the ' farmers. The oats had failed, the hay had been i drowned hy the weather and the flood», the cattle had scarcely anything to eat, and there was ¡tome thing like starvation in the dales. The curate had collected a subscription in the lower country, and was himself raking about the money to the different farms, bnt the distances were so great that he was sometimed ki>pt till quite Ute at night. One evening on his outward journey he xuddenly became aware of a figure moving beside hi;», and in the gloaming he recognised hiB brother who had died some time before. He waB too awe-struck for any wordR, and after keeping by his side for Borne distance over the lonely moor the silent figure disappeared Hp noted down the time and thp vision, but nothing occurred to throw any light upon it. Some years after he had taken the duty at, a coal in another part of the country, and one of the prisoners, being under sentence, desired to ron ko a confession to him. He told a number of crimes, and ended with " I was very near once taking your life, sir. It was in that bad year I heard as how you went carrying money about in those lonesome dales. I hid behind the big boulders on the brown moor, I seen you coming up, and waited till you should be near enough, but that night you were not alone."-Lady Vemer's " In the Dales Sixty Years Sinca."
