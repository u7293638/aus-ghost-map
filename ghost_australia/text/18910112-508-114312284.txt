PORT JACKSON SAILING CLUB. Owing to the unpleasant weather on Saturday afternoon, the Port Jackson Sailing Club postponed their race for the Mark Foy medals until next Satur day afternoon. The entries and handicaps are : Man tura and Craigilee, scratch; Lottie and Idothea, 2min : Atalanta and Esmeralda. 3min : Isadore. 4min : Scylla, Massilia, Our Tom, and Wild Wave, 6min ; Violet, Our May, and Ghost, 7min ; Imogene and Iverna, 10min. The jedging is to be by points, those allotted being four for first boat, three for second, two for third, and one for fourth, and the crew of the boat scoring the most points in the three races secures the medals. The usual money prizes will also be given, and there is great interest centred in the results. The only condition attached to the races is that the boats will receive their handicap at the start, and Mr. Foy has arranged a complete system whereby this method can be carried out successfully. By the way, Mr. Foy's system will be in use at the starting of the races at the National Regatta.
