SOME FAMOUS JULIETS. The first representative of the character of Juliet, in Shakespeare's time, would of course be a smooth faced, soft-voiced boy and the first woman who appeared upon the English stage was also the first actress who sustained the part just spoken of. It was thought necessary to apologise for the innovation in a prologue, which pleaded to the audience for their courtesy and forbearance, in these terms " I once 1 out will be censarme, do it fairly though. 'Tis possible a virtuous woman may Abhor all sorts of looseuotB, and yet play - Day on the stage, where all eyes are upon her Shall v. a count that a critic, France counts an honour?" now this lady who afterwards became the wife of the famous Betterton-acted the Character we cannot learn. The most celebrated of the boy actresses was Kynaston, who " made the loveliest lady, " says old Reply s, that ever I saw 117 my life." And another writer of the same period tells us how ladies of title used to take him into their douche, after the performance was over, and drive with him round the park in his stage dress," and how King Charles had to wait one afternoon for the play to begin while humor was being shaved fur Evadne, in " The Maid's Tragedy Between those times and the days of Garrick there may have been several Juliets who took the town by storm, but there were no critics to analyse their performances, or to extol the fine qualities of their acting, and perhaps we should have heard very little of Miss or Mrs George Anne Bellamy, and of beautiful Mrs Cibber, in their respective in- terpretations of the character, had it not been that they were rivals in it, and were simultaneously enacting it, the one with Barry as Romeo nt Covent- garden, and the other with Garrick as her lover at Drury, lane. The difference between the two Romana was admirably discriminated by a lady of quality at the time, who said that, had she played Juliet to Garrick's Borneo, so impassioned was he that she should have expected him to climb the balcony and so came up to her; but bad Barry been her lover, so seductive was be that she should certainly have jumped down to him " In elegance of person, and in the management of a flexible voice, Miss Bellamy left little to be desired 11s Juliet, but her passion in the stronger scenes was spasmodic, and her acting was deficient in finish and in natural grace. Mrs Cibber, on the other band, was quite as charming in person as her rival, and she exhibited a pathos and a tenderness that moved her audience to tears ; while, as Murphy the dramatist tells us, the expression of her countenance and the irresistible range other voice thrilled to the very soul of late I spectator." the nest famous Juliet was Miss O'Neill who was in the hey day of her renown rather more than seventy years ago Her lace was singularly expressive, and presented that mixture of beauty and passion which is visible in some of the finest of the Greek statues. ' Her voice was distinct, powerful and of considerable compass , her action in pressive and simple She looked the part she had to perform, and filled up the pauses in the words by the varied expression of her countenance or gestures without anything artificial, pointed, or lar fetched She excelled in the silent expression of emotion, and her delivery of the speeches in the scenes where she laments Romeos banishment, and anticipates her awakening in the tomb marked the Que play and undulation of natural sensibility), rising and falling with the gusts of passion and at last worked up into an agony of despair, in which imagination approached the brink of freney On the 5th of October, 1829 Fanny Kemble, who is still living, made her first appearance on the stage of Covent Garden '] Theatre in this arduous character her mother playing Lady Capulet, and her father Mercutio The specific charm of Juliet, as interpreted by Fanny Kemble, was its innocent gracefulness. She was only 13 at the time She inherited the family beauty, and her dark eyes and dark complexion helped to render her the very beau-ideal or the beautiful Veronese Her scene with the nurse was full of delightful simplicity, and she carried her audience away by the intensity of her acting to the scene where Juliet drinks the sleeping potion Campbell the poet, who was present, says -' The face of every spectator showed that he was electrified by the influence of new tried genius, and was collecting emotions in silence as he watched its development to swell its triumph with fresh declamation. I for my own part, the illusion that Bile was that . neurea own Juliet came so speedily upon me as to suspend the power of spee fie criticism " A year before this an English actress named Smithson, who was the leading lady in the company which Macready took to Paris, captivated the public in that city by her exquisite rendering of the character of Juliet Her inspired acting to borrow a phrase from her French critics perhaps this most existent in Europe caused the oper tutors to become almost delirious with excitement, and her benefit night was one of the most brilliant events of the season -charles V presented her with a purse of gold and from the Duchess no 1 cart she received a magnificent vine of Fires china She was called and recalled before the cur turn, and the st he was quite carpeted and the bouquets and wreaths thrown to her 11 the enthusiastic audience Hector Berbo the distinguished' composer, tells us in his memoirs that, after seeing MISS Smithson in Ophelia and Juliet, he fell into J. strangely nervous condition He could not work, he could not rest, sleep was denied him He could do nothing but wander aimlessly about Paris and its environs It is only right to complete the narrative by mentioning that, five years afterwards, when a series of reverses had overtaken the once prosperous actress, the composer prevailed upon her to accept his hand, and they commenced their married life with the magnificent capital of twelve pounds sterling, which he had borrowed from a friend When she died in 1824, Jules Janin, the prince of French critics, declared that Juliet had gone down into the tomb with her But remembering, aside, the Juliet of Helen Faucit, now Ludv 'J Theodore Martin, I cannot subscribe to Jules Janin's dictum 1 or, to my thinking, that great actress was the very embodiment of the exquisite creation Bbe impersonated. In nee, figure, and voice, nature had specially qualified her for it, and, carried away by the passion and Poetry of the character, her heart warming and her imagination kindling with its fervour, she caused you to forget every thing around you, and she made you feel that you were standing in one of the nightingale haunted gardens of a cross, listening to what she herself has called " the noblest groan to Love ever written, so supreme in subtlety of feel ing and expression that Romeo in the garden scene in spell bound into silence, and cannot break the music of those words that flood his heart with happiness " 0, to be seventeen again, to struggle into the pit of Covent Garden Theatre, and secure a seat upon the fourth or fifth row to open the bill, and see such names as those of Helen Faucit, Mrs Glover, Macready, Elton, Anderson, Phelps, Harley, and Vining in the cast, to watch the curtain rise upon scenery painted by Clarkson Stanfield and David Roberts, and to listen, with all a boy's enthusiasm and romantic s ailments, to the luscious music of that dramatic poem, which, BE Mrs Jameson says, | is full of "till soft and delicate images-all lovely forms divinest voices and entrancing melodicB-gleams of summer skies and fairer climes-Italian moonlight., and airs that 1 breathe of the sweet South.' ' In the year 1894 Miss. Stella Coles drew crowds of people to the Princess's Theatre in Oxford street night after night to witness her performance of Juliet, and yet she murdered Shakspeare fearfully, for her portrait of the innocent Italian child was everything it ought not to be. She made her an abomin- able coquette. She introduced all the stage artifices and ghastly grimaces of n I rench ing√©nue" She " looked obtrusively conscious of every part of herself, from the tip of her nose to the lips of her toes " Before taking the sleeping potion she received from the imagined ghost of cobalt with a melodramatic scream loud enough to awaken all the inmates of her father's palace, flying about the room in wild excitement, and then scrambling into bed with more haste than dexterity And set, in spite of her broken English and her bad acting, the public applauded her to the echo Very different was the Juliet of Miss Adelaide Lilian Neilson, the daughter of a Spanish father and an English mother, who made her debut at the Royalty Theatre in that character in July, 1863 She was only fifteen years of age, one year older than Juliet, and excepting that she had a fair northern complexion, which, however, is common enough in Lombardy, she looked the part to perfection, ft came to be her masterpiece. She had studied it with an earnestness born of complete sympathy with its loveliness She put her whole heart into it, and her own in- tative perception of us beauty enabled her to impress that beauty upon her audience Her language appeared to be the spontaneous utterance of the moment, and not something which she had committed to memory And the same with her acting-every gesture and movement seemed to be unpremeditated, and to have been umpired by the incident or the situation in the first two acts the transparent innocence and guileless simplicity of Juliet's nature were exquisitely brought out. She reminded you of a delicate rosebud, with the dew and freshness of the morning still cling- ing to it. And then she suddenly bloomed into the bright consummate flower In the latter acts of the play, indeed, as a critic in the Atheiaunt well observed, "Sheastended to a tragic elevation and fire that seemed less art than inspiration ' But what is the highest art, in reality, if it be not in aspiration '-a sudden influx of light, a flash of genius, an unexpected acquisition of power, and exaltation of feeling, that comes we know not whence, lifts the great artist out of himself for the time being, and enables him to breathe ' u rarer ether, a diviner air " Coming back, however, to the criticism previously quoted, the writer of it proceeds as follows -" To say that the potion scene had a passionate intensity and a concentrated power such as no modern representation on the English stage has exhibited, is to do it no more than justice 'The tenderness and grace of the early scenes were in striking contrast with the gloom and terror of the later " _ | I can imagine Miss Ellen Terry to have been a charming Juliet fifteen or twenty years ago, but now that she is, unhappily, on the wrong side of forty, she substitutes the art of the actress for the spontaneous affection the unstudied innocence, simplicity, and impulsive unreserve of 'Shakspeare's lovely creation You feel that the beautiful I elocution, the attitudes, the gestures, and the "business" of the scene are those of an old stager, with whom every point in premeditated, and every effect carefully pre-arranged 'The art is the best of its kind, but there is not a touch of nature, not a flash of inspiration in the whole performance Of Miss Mary Anderson I can only speak from hearsay , but, according to an impartial critic, her Juliet totally lacks distinction, depth, and subtlety." She is represented as " an American schoolgirl, with a considerable sense of humour, drifting into a not over dignified flirtation with a sentimental young man. The passages of lyric raptures are spoken without the slightest feeling for their 16 rich quality. . 1 be potion scene lucks gradation, and in the scene where she learns that Romeo is banished, she manages for once to strain her voice, and positively rants. Two really fine passage relieve the general mediocrity of the performance, to wit, the coaxing scene with the nurse, and the scene in the 1 man's cell" That she looks the character goes without saying. I am indebted to an American friend for a brief estimate of the Juliet of Mme. Modjeska. He tells me that while that lady's artistic earnestness and intellectual capacity compel respect, her performance of this churn der does not win your admiration. It is throughout nervous and hysterical, ner simplicity is womanly not girlish, and her passion sounds no great depths You feel that you are witnessing the efforts of a highly gifted woman, with a charming p. rare quality and of refined culture that is somewhat rare upon the stage ; but you are not brought into the presence of Juliet It remains to speak of one other Juliet that of Mrs Scott Siddons, who is well remembered in this city If her acting of it was unequal, it was free from slugs near. Her articulation was distinct, and her face and figure were admirably suited to the park She was stronger in the earlier than in the later acts Her play for dialogues with the nurse, her love passages with Romeo, including the whole of the balcony scene, were quite delightful Her vehemence in the potion scene was somewhat strained, and she was a little too violent in the chamber scene, while there was also a tendency to over elaboration in the death scene, but there was so much that was admirable in the two best acts that her audience were predisposed to be lenient in regard to the shortcomings of the others, But, after all, no Juliet upon the stage and film the ideal which each of us forms of the character when reading it in our own studies ; especially in the golden morning of our lives, when the ardent imagination of the boy-lover ! heightens all the attributes with which the dramatist has invested one of the loveliest creations of his marvellous genius.
