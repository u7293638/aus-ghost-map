" '" Bx M BliTHAM ISDWAttUb, Author of " Doclor Jacob,"'"-Kitty," etc lb happened one midwinter,- many years ago, that, in company with other travellers, I was snowed up at Marsullbs I had embaike 1 from Algiers, : leaving tropical weather behind, but a suddfiu .storm came.up in fchelxulfQif •: Lyons; After tossing about uneomfortably for many hours in sight of port,, we were obliged tu put back to sea,:. our passage lusting double the usual tune. .

The midday and six o'clock - table cTldle oflered. ii. variety of dishes;:; cooked in the best French manner; after dinner, ruusic, conversation, and cards made up for the want of letters and newspapers.
