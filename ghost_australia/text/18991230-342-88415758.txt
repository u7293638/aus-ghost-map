[?] W.A, TURF CLUB. NEW YEAR MEETING, By 'Proteus.**' the Western Australian Turf Club mil hoist its flags to-day in honor of the commencement of -.it? New Year meet-, ing. Although the opening day's pro gramme contains six important events, five of them pale into insigiifica i;c when compared with the Derby. '1 hie classic event does not contain such a | good class of horse? as sported silk -last year, and three of the candidate-* suncl ; out prominently as likely to tarnish the ! placed division. The three are. Wai- ' riri, Gipsy Bill, and Wise Step. Wairri , has been doing such wonderful Uriahs on the track that she is the absolute fa vorite, a;nd the stable connections have genuinely supported her for a lot of money, finishing up yesterday with a century on the filly at evens. She is by that wonderful- old horse Malua, and if she has any of- the Melbourne Cup win ner's qualities the distance should not be an inch. too far for her. As a twoyear old -. -she^von Jthe Sapling Stakes, al though it might be mentioned that Lim ber, who ranisecond. was giving away to her 20113. ;T.hird in the Juvenile Han dicap tpsLimber was her next perform- j ancejthen she -ran second to Wise Step ? in ai^d-y.eaViold handicap, concedirg the winner 171b. After that she did al ?rrmst everything that was asked of her' carrying off the Kensington Handicap1 - ??; Karrakatta Handicap, ; Cremorne H: n \- dicap,: and §wan Handicap. What r brilliant ^?o-y^-cld career, to be n-re '. As a three-yc;^P:ld vye have not beeij permitted to sfee much of the filly undeT silk; but her party have been showr snrnething_.o£ a daisy-rutting nature iTi the way of % good trial over the distance and whatrfnore is ?wanted than to kno~v that she is; ah honest trier and that she carv stay; the distance i - Limber ha- a iaij^;tw.o^6ar)f6i:^Agerfo.rmancc list, but tlic^LigM^ not been ;' !doi;B:g;Vsibffi(frehtry' ? well to give her a ;:-cha'n;c'e';wiSi''Wairiri. Gipsy Bill proved aniabsolTiteiailure as a two- year-old in the. Eastein'1 colonies, but he has re trieved' hiif character with another win ter over his-head, and his form at the' Canning Park meeting the other day . ' has ledhisrparty to believe that the Bill of Portland rcolt has a very good chance of lowering -the favorite's colors. Wise Step, like Gipsy Bill, has very little to recommend him as a youngster, with the exception of a dash of form at the Canning Park meeting the otlur day; He is by Russley, the sire of Picture who won an A.J.C. Derby. Of the re mainder of.' the field I will have nothing to say, believing that they have not the ghost of a chance of deposing the can didates I have mentioned.
