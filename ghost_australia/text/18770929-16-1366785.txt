Turf Notes. By VENISON. A NEAT little triangular literary duel came off a short time ago between our exhibition reporter in the horse department, Mr J V Bell, and Mr Pountney, all anent the " understandings of the horse Epigram and the general question of Blair Athol s ability to " go and stay, and the powers of his progeny to boot in the same direction Into this controversy I have no wish to enter except to mention the few ideas it has given rise to as far as I am concerned Mathe malicious and engineers alone can determine as to the shape and angle of bone, which, set in motion by muscle, is best calculated to ensure speed and endurance in a vitalised machine, and as to whether the horse, the ass, the greyhound, the hare, or the deer develop most of those qualities, as per plan and elevation, I will not pretend to determine A great deal would seem to depend upon the habits, of life which pertain to the creature under discussion The grizzly bear is not built for speed, if we regard him from a mechanical point of view, but when in pursuit of a man he can-as the Rocky Mountain hunters will tell you-" hope awful smart The wild boar again, does not give altogether one the idea of a galloping machine, and yet he takes a deal of catching even by that Arab horse of which Captain Upton writes so learnedly If you take the skeleton-" cannon bones, pasterns, ' shoulder blades, and all-of an average Wide Bay blackfellow, and that of an ordinary respectable taxpaying white Queenslander, you will not discover any startling points of difference and yet, you know, if it came to a foot race or a life chase, either way, across country for ten miles, or as many furlongs, or even a couple of hundred yards, I fancy that the ' darkey, somehow, would " carry the money " Again, the wild ass of Ama, the wild horse of the medium warm latitudes of North America, are all very " unmatchable animals, and not less BO IS the cowardly jackal, fox, or " coyote ' of California, who can extend, and laugh at, a kangaroo dog or greyhound, that model of speed as far as shape goes It all seems to depend so much more on the mode of life than on the shape of the skeleton that whether the subject be man, horse, ass, pig, boar, jackal, deer, or what not, all centre verses to which is the shape that gives speed combined with endurance-is, to some extent, in vain We all are agreed, no doubt, that the guinea pig, tortoise, and Bail will never make gallopers , but shape is not everything, as many a stock horse in pursuit of a refractory cow or calf on a drafting camp could tell you, if gifted with speech It is the early hours, the natural, regular and open air life that have much to do with the business Hence all the excellence of the unsophisticated Arab strum A consideration of thereon "intense finish for the Sj wins by Derby suggests to the philosophical mind how that, year by year, "pots' and coal vanities rest on a very frail foundation, which grows frailer and frailer as time proceeds and be a horse never B I good there is somehow or other, always lying in wait for blind customer to make him BtietohhimBolf, and to prevent any thing like monopoly or monotony from being set up or established Speaking of the late Randwick meet as a whole, it his set in debiting seriously as to whether Yattendon or Maribyrnong may be set down as the best shot in Australia, on his ma its, for "generally useful i teingpurposos Whatwao, I wonder, the secret of that remarkable race between fisher man and the d ma of Muribi racing that has made the latter (of whom nothing remarkable was expected at the time) the marvellous success he has since proved as a sire of winn BIS ? Mm ibyiuong does not appear on the whole to have been mated with such grand dames of blue blood as has Yattendon and yet, if one loves the hat of the progeny of each, Maribyrnong with his inferior chances and his (supposed to be) inferior pedigree, his decidedly not come off worst in the competition Laertes, Clifton, Hamlet, Cap a pro, Horatio, Lva, Richmond, Hawkesbury, Imperial, Di ci, und Woodlands, are as good as Neredah, Queen s Hold, DagwoiUi, Reprieve, Chester, Habeni, Ringwood, .tiinhopOjStcrhiig, Valentia, Wi thigh, Black Eagle, and Dilemma Whether you take the heavy artillery of the lighter (Lalla in these competitive lists, whether you take the three miles of the offenders , whether you go for handicap 01 weight for ago, it is all the Burne, and it is difficult for anyone to say where the superiority, if any, of the Sir Hercules Cass and 1 cross is appar cut, when compared with that to which we owe the existence of Maribyrnong In the case where both sexes were put to the same mare, Alpaca, few will deny that Woodlmds, for instance, comes out superior to Ringwood Tew and small were the in the dances for the three mile Randwick Plate selected still were the starters, and a " hold of since (I) greeted the optics of the level B of sport on the final day Is it that we have no three men is left of the old stock, or coming forward of the now ? Or is it that "we" decline to show our yards for a matter of " 1 couple of hundred pounds, when we may, by keeping dall., land £1000 and Bvveops, and oh! more delicious by far, the "Ring money on next New Year a day Who'd be bothered knocking his home H legs to pieces for JÍ.200, when he could knock them in pieces to a much merrier time ' Another HOU of my old favorite Blinkhoolie won a race at Ascot the five year old Chypie, from a mare called Ess Bouquet, carried 7 st 3 lbs and won the Ascot Stakes, two miles, in 3 31 This is a good pure, being COO sovereigns, with a sweep of 25, and sixty subscribers I lie handsome group of silver and ga, worth 1500, and called the Roy 21 Hunt Cup, at Ascot, a handicap of a mile, was won by a son of See Saw, from Honeymoon, and called Cradle , a son of Sncchai meter being second, and one of Toxo photo being third, Whitebait, Hopbloom, md the Ghost being in the nick Glen Arthur, the outsider who ran second for the Derby, and never did any thing before that time, will be remembered by many is the year ling who fetched 1800 prices, which Joe Dawson c, iv 1 for him at the Sheffield lane Bile, and who bids fair now to justify the figure paid for him he won the Prince of Wales Stakes at Ascot, value COLT Hudrton, the English jockey who rode the outsider 1st ChriHtophu, winner of the Grand Prix de Paris, cleared £10,000 by his performance-a good day's work for a Sunday and to " Sunday out in more senses than one The time was 5 21, or two seconds f later than Kisber s wm and the value of the stakes £130 the Tynesiders are great sportsmen, and retain undying memories of Underhand and Caller On and, this year, Hampton, with Wobbm the saddle, managed to catch Anchor asleep on Glendale, and improved the shining hour by binding the Northumberland Plate from that of favorite ; the winner, Lord Clifden H son, c earned 8 st 12 lbs They keep on gambling as usual in England, and whether the Cup be of Manchester, Liverpool, Ascot, or what not, this, that, or the other horse is sure to have more or less of a B d invested, ' as they term it, on him or her, as the case may be " Investment ' had a different meaning a hundred years ago, in the days of Mrs Hannah More and Mrs Lhcabcth Try And speaking of Liverpool, in the Cup of that ilk the public were greatly disappointed when Lord Wilton-whose racers have such suggestively feminine names as are derived from Sandal, Honeymoon, ka - scratched, foolishly, his filly footstep for the Cip merely because of having been beaten by a good horse like Hesper, the victor of Low lander The heavily weighted Petrarch thereupon became top favorite, and, the money being exhausted, he progressed from even money to Blight odds on him, which he fully justified by running a great race against the (0 to) Small, and slight stumble just within a tenth of a "cooey" of the judge's post, upset the hundreds to five that were shouted on Petrarch as he came up the straight, where, Small having been allowed on sufferance- e to reach Petrarch s neck, the stumble allowed him to beat the Leger winner by a head This for Liverpool, and as for Ascot, I mention it once more just to express my regret that Mr That did not re-name Amendment " Ascot," in honor of the illustrious winners of the great prize there whose blood reappears in the Metropolitan hero's veins Amendment, of ri Proposition, is all very well to assist one's memory confused and overburdened by turf nomenclature but old AScot would have been only fairly honored by one of the best colts, and possibly the best colt, Aurora's has yet produced, being so named Public interest at home was, when the mail left, concentrated on the question of who was to win the Goodwood Stakes, a handicap of two miles and a half. Rylstone, who did well at Ascot, was the favorite, while Hampton, with 9st 6lbs, was also well supported This long handicap race has been won several times under heavy weight, viz., by Lucetta, with St 50s in 1832 by Glaucus, with flot 8lbs in 1835 by Gomera, with 9st, in 1867 and by Paganini, with 8st 10lb in 1870 A Bale of young blood stock took place at Newmarket on the 2nd of July, the same being the property of Captain Ray (owner of Gladiateur), of Lord Rosslyn u, and Sir Cooper As I think the sales of all youngsters who fetch over 1000 guineas are worth acting for future reference, I record the following -Bay filly by Adventurer, from a Stockwell mare, 1350 guineas, to Mr Humphreys , a bay filly by Winslow, from Tor- ' mode, by Buccaneer, for 1500 guineas, to Major Barlow , a bay colt by Cecrops out of Light, by Prime Minister, for 1850 turns is, to Mr Black- man, bay filly or Scottish Chief from Virtue, by Stockwell, 1000 guineas, to Mr Peck , a bay colt by Adventurer (sire of Glen Arthur), from Atonement by Oulston, for 1450 guineas, to Lord Hardwicke , St Bruno, a boy colt, by Musket, from Monaca by Beadsman, went near the four figures, realising 920 guineas The following horses in full training, and the property of Mr A Biltazn, have been sold -John Day, i years, by John Davis born Breakwater, for 2650 guineas, to Lord Marcus Beresford, and C Amiens, 5 years, by Beadsman from Bas Bleu (dam of blue Gown), for 1950 guineas, to Mr Fitzroy Heavy betting goes on among the Melbourne Derby and Cup, the changes being rung on First in Chester, Amendment, and Woodlands, "till further orders " There is nothing better to my mind than the two Amendments, and but for the fact of BriBCis and Briseis having come off last year, and its being too much of a coincidence to expect one horse to do the double trick the year following, I I verily believe I should throw away a " corner " on the grandson of Colsterdale
