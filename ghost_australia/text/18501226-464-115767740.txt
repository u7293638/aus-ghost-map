In recording my personal experience of the influence of the doctrines of Catholisism, and the remarks I have been able to make upon their influence on, other Catholics, it may be as well to commence by slating the general character of that sense of relation ship to the invisible world which the Catho lic rplio-inn Timfpssps tn TOnrk in the*, mind with an efficacy peculiarly its own. I must remind the Protestant reader, then, that the Catholic Church claims to possess a power of communicating to her children a certain definite spiritual gift, which she terms faith, by which a pious Catholic is not obly morally certain of the truth of all Catholic doctrines, and contem plates the actual spiritual realities which those doctrines speak of, as realities, and not as mere opinions, figments of the human mind, or logical deductions, having no exis tence apart from the reasonings which prove them. This faith she professes to commu nicate originally at baptism, and to restore, when lost after baptism, by a worthy parti cipation in the sacrament of penance. It is the result of that indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the soul, which accompanies bap tism in the case of all infants whatsoever, and of all adults who receive baptism with the proper dispositions. In infants it begins its work the moment the dormant intelli gence awakes to life and thought ; so that as fast as external teaching communicates to the growing mind the various dogmas of Christianity, so fast does the youthful Chris tian grasp them with the confidence of a living faith, and regard them not merely as the private opinions of its teachers, but as the- word of God, and as positive, existing, and ever- present, though invisible, realities. What, then, ought we naturally to expect to find to be the consequence of a reconci liation to the Catholic Cnurch in the case of a person who, though rightly baptised (probably) in his infancy, and thus made a ~ member of the Catholic Church,* has grown lo manhood in schism, perhaps in mortal sin, and certainly without partaking in those ordinary '.means of grace which Jesus Christ has appointed for keeping alive and maturing this great gift of faith which he received at his baptism 1 In such an individual, even if he has not forfeited his baptismal grace by mortal sin and wilful disobedience to the true Church, yet nevertheless the power of faith will be fearfully weakened, his hold upon religious truths will be feeble and trembling, and he will have become, , if not like a blind man, at least like one whose eyes are dim, or who gropes his way along by the aid of the faint, flickering light of a half-extinguished lamp, instead of walking freely and courageously in the broad blaze of day. Consequently, if the pretensions of the Catholic Church be well founded, and such a person be really re-admitted to the possession of this mysterious and wonder working gift, h,e will necessarily perceive (if he be at all given to watch the phenomena of his own mind) that he has literally ac quired a new faculty, that the unseen world has become to him what it was not before, and that the range of his intellectual vision is not only far wider, but far keener and more sure, than while he continued a mem ber of any Protestant communion. And such I have no scruple in declaring to be the case with myself, and with every person with whom I have conversed- on the subject, and who was capable of instituting the necessary investigation into the process of his own mind. And 1 am speaking, be it observed, not of those instances in which tbe convert has been undeniably a mere devotee of this world's vanities before his conversion, and in which it Would be natural that invisible things should produce a totally new impression upon him, simply from the fact that now he is earnest, while formerly he was heedless of his soul, of eternity, and of God. I am examining the state of those who for years and years before their conver sion have been labouring to the very utmost of their powers, with all apparent sincerity, to save their souls and to do the will of God ; who by constant prayer, meditation, morti fication, and study, have striven to realise the mysteries of the Gospel, so far as they knew of them, and to preserve in their thoughts an unceasing and vivid recollection of the tremendously momentous nature of that world which is unseen, but of whose existence they are convinced by irrefragable demonstrations- of reasoning. Presuming, then, though most humhly, to hope that such was my own case while I was still a member oi the Church of England, I cannot but be conscious that by suomitting to the Church of Rome, and entering her pale, I liave received a fresh and extraordinary ac cession to my powers of believing in the truths of Christianity and Catholicism, and of habitually regarding the objects of faith as living, external, ever-present realities. To a certain extent I believe that this in crease came upon me at once, the moment that I was reconciled to the Catholic Church ; but as the feelings at such a time are natu rally highly excited, it is almost impossible for a person to analyse correctly the processes of his own intelligence, either at the hour itself when the change in his circumstances takes place, or for some lengthened period afterwards, during which the novelty of all that is around and within him produces effects upon the reason and the imagination vvhieh may be easily mistaken for purely spiritual results, which they have no real claim to be. Judging, therefore, by what I have per ceived tobethepmwawefltfresultuponthemind, I venture to say that 1 have found the pro mises of the Catholic Church to be strictly * The Protestant reader will bear in mind that the Roman Church teaches that every infant who is rightly baptised, whether by a Catholic, a member of the Church of England, by a Dissenter of any de nomination, including Socinians, or even by a Jew or Pagan, and whether by a man, a woman, or a child, is chereby regenerated and made a member of the Roman Catholie Church ; and baptism is rightly confe/red when the person baptising pours water upon the person baptised, or immerses him in water, at the same moment be utters the words, ?? I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,' having himself the intention of doing that which Jesus Christ commanded when He instituted the ordinance of baptism. The private pinions of the person who baptises have nothing to so with the efficacy of the baptism, which depends s mply upon his intending to do whit our Lord com manded, whatever that was. fulfilled, and that reception into her bosom does confer upon the intelligence a power both of resting with undoubting certainty upon the declarations of the Church, and of realising the presence and various attributes of the invisible would, to an extent to which I was previously an utter stranger. That which before I found an unconquerable diffi-, culty, I now find to vanish before a well directed effort of the will. Those duties which before presented a repulsive and awful aspect, commend themselves to my inclina tions with a sweetness and attractiveness which enchain the better portion of my whole being, however violently the evil pro pensities of nature at times may rebel. Those Catholic doctrines, such as transub statiation; the invocation of saints, the effi cacy of the intercession of Mary, the reality of purgatory, the value of vicarious suffer ing and of the indulgences granted by the Church, — these and , other such dogmas, of the truth of which I was firmly convinced before I even thought of actually becoming a Catholic, but which I found it impossible to realise, with all the efforts I made, in ac cordance with the convictions of my reason, — all these have naturally become to me as truly a part of the eternal realities of the existing world, as the globe on which we dwell, the stars above our heads, or tne bodies with which we find ourselves clothed. I am not saying whether this is, or is not, enthusiasm, mysticism, self-deception, or any other product of the morbid action of an excited imagination ; I only allege, that after instituting the calmest inquiries into my internal consciousness, and contrasting what were my past with what are my present sen sations, and again, comparing the operations of my mind towards the invisible world with its operations towards the visible, I have come to the experimental conviction, that the pro mise of the Catholic Church, that she will confer a new spiritual faculty upon the soul, is not a delusion, but that we actually are in possession of a mysterious power, — call it instinct, call it power of vision or contact, call it inward consciousness, or what you will, — which enables us to live on from hour to honr, under an habitual impression of the reality of the. being and attribntes of God, of eternity, of heaven, hell, and purgatory, and of the varied objects of the Catholic's faith, and which I am equally convined is not pos sessed by conscientious Protestants, as such, whatever may be their creed, or whatever their struggles to obtain it. Baptised chil dren, who are nominally Protestants, but really Catholics, are of course in possession af this gift; and its results are so marvel lous, that observant Protestants constantly contrast the facility with which their children realise the truths of religion with the diffi culties they themselves experience in piercing through the veil which hides God and eter nity from their gaze. Nor do I presume to allege, that Almighty God may not, in His overflowing mercy, in certain exceptional cases, bestow upon religious separatists, who are in invincible ignorance, such an extraor dinary effusion of .His grace, as may open their eyes, with all the clearness of Catholic faith, to the mysteries into which natural sight cannot pierce. I he Catholic Church expresses no opinion as to individuals who are without her pale, and teaches nothing respecting subjects which are not revealed. But that the mental power of living in an habitual sense of the presence of God, and of realising the truths of revelation, which is possessed by ordinary Protestants,, even the most orthodox and the most devout, is at all to be compared with that which is the treasure of every sincere Catholic, I believe to be a purely gratuitous assumption, which will be denied bv everv Derson who. like mv self, knows both Protestantism and Catho jicism by his own experience and trial. And the more observations I am enabled to make upon the mental conditiou of other Catholics, of all ages, ranks, and degrees of intelligence, the more numerous are the proofs I discover of the truth of what I have stated. Wherever 1 meet with a man or a woman, ah ecclesiastic or a layman, who is even tolerably attentive to his duties as a . Catholic, I perceive the same facilities of be lieving all that tbe Church teaches, and of recognising Christian doctrines, not merely as the statements of well-proved opinions, but as matters of fact. One and all, they plainly shew that to their minds the great mystery of existence is cleared up; the blindness which darkens the eyes of man by nature is in their case cured. The three Persons in the blessed Trinity, the divinity and humanity of Jesus Christ, the heaven in which the Mother of God and His other Saints are now interceding for them, the hell in which the reprobate are punished for ever, the purgatory in which the imperfect souls of those who love God are purified be fore admittance into heaven, the real pre sence of Jesus Christ in His glorified body in the consecrated eucharistic species, the actual communication of pardon to the peni tent in the sacrament of penance, the pos session of miraculous powers by the existing Church of the present day, the benefit con ferred on the departed faithful by the prayers of the living, the reality of that spiritual help which sincere prayer infallibly brings down from God into our souls ; — all these things are clearly to the Catholics whom we daily associate with, not mere doctrines or opinions, but things, which they no more practically forget in action, than they forget that there are twenty-four hours in the day, and that a man must eat and drink in order to live. This, I repeat, is to be observed, not only in our greatest saints, in men and women whose lives are given up to prayer and- meditation, or to serving Christ in the persons of His poor, but in every common place Catholic who has any pretensions to be sincere, and to practise heartily that religion which he professes to believe. They have manifestly received a revelation from God» The heavens have been opened to them, and they are as men who see in the midst of a blinded race. At the same time, let it not be supposed that I mean that the Catholie is not subject as a human being to that difficulty of fix ing the attention upon invisible things, which forms one of the sore trials of our present state. Like the Protestant, at one time he finds it easy to withdraw his thoughts from secular objects, and, with an undivided thoughtfulness, to concentrate the powers of his mind upon the affairs of his soul ; at another, with all the efforts he makes, with all the iron energy of an indomitable will, he experiences an almost absolute helpless ness of thought, when he would meditate, pray, or calmly adore his Almighty Lord. His difference from the Protestant consists in this; that while the latter, when he has fixed is attention on the subject which he de sires, finds his soul still chained down to earth, by the want of some faculty of be lieving without doubt, and of contemplating unseen things, as well as of believing certain doctrinal sacrament's ; the former, even when his attention is most obstinate in refusing to be fixed, yet experiences no difficulty in re cognising the infallible truth of his creed, and in acting towards the objects of his faith with the same facility of energy with which he conducts himself towards what he sees with his bodily eyes. The devout Protestant, will not dispute what I say, when 1 allege that so soon as he can disengage himself from the entanglement of his own inward thoughts, 5;elings, emotions, and convctions, and go directly out of himself, and fix his attention solely upon objective realities, apart from his own ideas, he is conscious of an awful, dreadful, distressing sensation of intellectual help'essness, which chills his fervour, daunts his energies, and throws him back, again and again, upon secular objects, as the only things which are really sure, the only things on which he knows he cannot be mistaken. If he is in any degree a thinking and candid person, and willing to subject the views in which he has been brought up to the test of rigid proof, the consciousness of the miser able dpfifM£nr»Pa nf /mi; nrnnto niUi^K U n~~ rely upon, repeatedly tortures and agitates him, and he feels as if he would give the world only to be convinced on irrefragable grounds that he is not trusting to a delusion of his own brain. And when he is least troubled with this consciousness of the sandy ground on which he is standing, and directs all his efforts to prayer, meditation, and- contempla- tion of divine things, still he feels like one who is shooting arrows into the dark,1 and aims he knows not where. He stands, as it were, upon the edge of a beetling precipice ; before him is the vast,, immeasurable ex panse of ether, but all overspread with a dense and impenetrable gloom; he would fain look and see what is the mighty land scape that he knows lies beneath his feet, who are its inhabitants, to whom he shall call for aid, and where he shall be received when he descends into that boundless region * but in vain he strains his eyes to see, and his ears to catch some clear response to hjs cry ; here and there a light gleams for a few moments, and he thinks all will be manifest —but it is gone, and the darkness seems blacker than before ; sounds— -musical, -wild unearthly— float upwards upon the breeze' and then all is still ; and he remains cold' trembling,, hoping, fearing; and returns ti his own thoughts, to his dry, unsatisfactory knowledge, to reason, to argument, to sell inspection, as the only means that remain for' learning the mysteries that refuse to unfold themselves to his sight. With us all is different. Our difficulty lies in fastening our attention, and in that alone. The cares and the pleasures, tie sorrows and the joys, the excitements and the occupations, of secular life, .distract and' harass us; while physical weakness occa sionally renders all purely mental exertion almost impossible to our enfeebled brain ;sc that it is at times with considerable difficulty we can enchain our minds, and force our thoughts to be obedient to our will, and pray or meditate with a perfect recollected ness and composure of spirit. But whenso ever we can do this, even in the slightest' degree, and if it be only for a few occasional I moments in which we force our thoughts away from the exditemeuts which would en slave them, then do we find all clear and open to our intellectual gaze. We are not I agitated by doubts ; we know that we are I right ; the more we reflect, the more com- I plete is the reasoning on which our religion I is based ; and the more we test it in prac I tice, the more satisfactorily does it commend I itself to our minds, and the more powerful I do we find that faculty of faith which we I have 'received. If the whole visible earth 1 and heavens were in a moment to vanish I from before our eyes, and God and His I Saints and Angels were to appear before us, 1 astounded, awe-struck, and humbled to the I dust as we should be, our souls would in- I stantly recognise the ineffable sight as- the 1 glorious manifestation of what we had ever 1 been beholding by faith ; it would be the i very same world of beauty, majesty, and e holiness, in whose presence we have been' K living, while it was still hidden from our I carnal vision.* ' B
