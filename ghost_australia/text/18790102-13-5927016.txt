BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL ROUTES. THE CITY OF ALLAH. BY J. H. Mahomet's faith has got great hold of India. Thirty SIX millions of the worshipper of Allah and his one prophet are to be found there-a number equal to the whole population of Great Britain They probably rea and apply the title, " defender of the faith, of their new Empress in their own way to way in which the Begonias thought to pas as serving under either king when asked to say which king or die The spread of the Mahomedan faith i Hindoostan is attributable to the many Pe: sian rulers whom large parts of it have had at times to acknowledge They brought rather a faith that taught the equality of a men to a cable ridden people, and press of the one Allah and his only prophet to th believers in many gods and the worshipper of endless idols This Allahabad, to this I am now come, is " the City of Allah which Mahomedans understand as the City of God That name "Allah is, I am told one of about eighty others by which the fo lowers of Mahomet designate the Deity Th religions of this land are of much interest time and my inquiries about Hindooism an Mahomedanism are frequent Folks push have thought that I wished to make choice between the two faiths Mahomedanism seems to be an offshoot or bastard son of the Jewish creed It recognises the Old Test' ment, but substitutes the Koran for the next one, and Mahomet as its Messiah, or as it prophet, it would be more proper to say a no kinship with the Deity is claimed named for him by the Mahomedan creed Allahabad, from its central position i chosen for the seat of government of the North western District A Lieutenant Governor is here resident, and to this place have been removed the Government official formerly at Agra It is to be also the grand junction of the present railway lines and others now constructing A grander junction than that, in the eyes of the Hindoos, I made also at this Allahabad The Gange and Jumna rivers join here and to them another river, to which I shall have to allude that is not visible to my infidel eyes-nor an Buch The city is situated about midway between Calcutta and Bombay, and has railroad con munication with both of them and water trade to Delhi, from which it is distant some four hundred miles While I am speaking of a modes of traffic I must notice a curious or that the Government officials adopt I able to native ones-called peons-who ride about on shoeless mode adopted especially the postmen, and not observable else where in India As I have mentioned the. name of a native servant, I may as we here mention the "Eurasians' who shall up a large number of Government employes They are the half caste of the country, an that is all of "cate that they can we claim the rights of The mixture of wind and native blood. has for ever shut them 01: from connexion with the thoroughbreds, w b are as strict about present ing their strain t blood in its purity as they are in observing the duties of their caste In those matters they are as conservative as gipsies, New haven fishermen, or the Galway Claddag fisher folk On getting to the hotel (Lawrie an Staten s) that I select out of the six the are at choice, I find a portmanteau avail ing me that had been sent on five week before from Calcutta. It presents a sad sight in the interior Everything is smotlierC' with mildew half an inch thick, and of all the colours of Stilton cheese lins stuff is stained all articles of cloth beyond recent, tion My host who sees my dismay, tells in that it is a climatic effect and that I should find my boots in as bad a state if left in the bedroom for a week unworn I might have expected such a state of things a damp, foggy Holland, but hardly in bright and sunny Hindoostan On looking at al the spoilt things, I am consoled by the thought that a few shillings will buy all the clothing wanted in India-all that I shall want, anyhow The Great Aklnr began this Allahabad three hundred years ago. His grandson Shah Jehan finished and christened it All around however, are time begrimed temples and tombs that speak of a Buddhist city having been hereabout long before the Mahomedans came as interlopers and destroyers A stone column of sixty feet in height that is to be here seen is credited with an age of more than two thousand years The inscriptions on it, so far as they can be deciphered, tell us that much Near to it are two red granite statues of large size now overthrown The features of that which represents a man are nearly obliterated but time has been kinder to the female figure, that shows still a pleasant looking face It is of the full eyed pulpy lipped order of beauty that was fashionable before the Grecian nosed, thin lipped style now in favour As fashions travel in cirUeB, thcolden one will again have its day On looking at these remnants of the past that so lie here on the plain, one thinks of the "two or three columns and man a stone, marble and granite, with grass o'ergrown that Byron says will only be left one day of all that is and is to be There is near to Allahabad an agricultural village, or collection of mud hovels, to which I pay a visit These places have neither chimney nor window The fuel is dried buffalo and cow droppings handful of sholl of rice twice a day, washed down with water, is about all these villagers ever have for meals incessant labour and hard fare make the men look clean and haggard, and the women stunted and hard featured Payments equivalent to half a crown, or less, a week is all that these labourers and families have to live upon Nothing can thus be saved, so that when the windows of Heaven are closed and the rains come not, the grim genius of famine appraises its shrivelled hand, the rice crop fails, and the villagers waste away to shadows and so die This has occurred periodically, and most likely will al was) a do so It is pitiable to look upon the ceaseless misery and the labours of the Hindoo place Early marriages are the rule, which help to make the rest of their wretched existence but a struggle with starvation in which their thin figures get thinner, until death kindly removes them to the wood pile by the water side No one who has seen their way of living and dying grieves at their deaths It is well to be out of the mess of such a life of misery) they can hardly find anything worse 'Ibeso wretchedly) paid "ryots, as the cultivators of the soil are called, are ground to death not only by heavy taxation, but also by the money lender, out of whose hands they only escape into the more friendly ones of death. These ryots of India represent the " fellahs ' of Eg) pt in the condition in which they live-if living it can be called By any one with B) sympathetic feelings, such I am troubled with, a visit to the quarters of these inexpressibly wretched people is to be avoided I did not feel in my usual spirits for twenty four hours afterwards, and wished I could have given away to these starving beings that which I now wanted the appetite to eat One of the Governors of India tried to get the population to vary the fashion of their dress-in fact, to dress a little more Like to mostEuropeana, the nakedness of the land, shown in that form, quite shocked his notions of decency, and more likely that of his family No one was in future to approach Government house with shoeless feet, naked legs, and nothing much to notice anywhere in the way of covering Success, however, did not attend his efforts The " one anna suit " that the Hindoo lower class adopt makes Hindoo stan a hard country indeed for tailors and shoemakers An old bed sheet, torn into stripes, makes clothing and turbans for a whole family for a twelvemonth As it is often not washed until it is the colour of the dingy surrounding skin, what there is of covering often passes notice. It is as well, as often as not, that it does so. ThereisnoneofthedignityoftheRedlndian, Maori, or the Caffre about the lower- class Hindoos. They are soft, feline, and bringing in their ways, and make the most persuasive of beggars I do not here speak of the h tribes The little English that they pick is made to go a great way As I come from the railway station one of them keeps along side of the harry and pleads there t advantages of the hotel for which he at as " runner " How he could run so fast as speak meanwhile was noticeable, but speak so effectively as he did was amazing The modulations of voice in which he urge his pleas for going to IIIB house were time and tried to arrest attention, and well the did so Though there were four of us in a! hurry, and we had plenty to observe a talk about, himself and his sayings money liked everything in theatrical language, ' filled the stage All the aids of an orator gestures, attitudes, actions, eyes as hands-were added to the perBuaaiv e tongue and all that On he ran at the rate of a carte mg horse, the thermometer meanwhile stan ing at 88 Our driver, in the interest of . oppoBitionhouse.treatedhim whenthe chan offered, to a clash with the whip, on what he had meantime to keep half an eye When 1 occasionally got a taste of this he turned to account, like to an accomplished river near "ScCjBare'seehowlBulTerforyourgoo I am beaten for your sake for your good on I want you to come to the best hotel' A new there and so meek No mosquitoes, and will be your guide for nothing, and take ye to all the good places 1 His eloquence ove came our lady passenger, and, of course, h husband had to acquiesce and follow li footsteps I was not sorry to see that she zeal as had been shown got that much of r ward When they were gone my remains companion remarked " That fellow you have talked over Satan himself Allahabad was in great force about the time of my visit It was the religious festive season, when the pilgrims come from a parts to this junction of the Jumna, a man that runs for eight hundred miles from a rise in the Himalayas, to the Ganges The join their great waters within sight of the city; The tongue of land where that takes place : now crowded daily with devotees among whom Btalk those holy men, the 1 skids and the ByngecB, as the religious fanatics are name This junction of two rivers to mort' eyes is to Hindoo eyes the junction t three This third, that I cannot discern runs direct from here to heaven. To bath in these visible and invisible waters the Hindoo pilgrim prepares by sitting on the bank of the perceptible river, and then getting a clean shave of both head and body all the hair shaved off falling into the water How great IS faith For each hair that B falls into these waters the Hindoo believes on the promise of his sacred writings and the preaching of his parents, that he will have thousand y ears in paradise No wonder a the completeness of the Shearing To many that no hairremainaadheaivothedevotee ther bathes himself, and comes out for priestly in spection There is something awe-stricken in this strength of faith I look upon one of these shaved believers sure of many thou- Banda or millions of years in heaven with great respect He is happier than I am, and for that I envy him His hairs are now floating away on the invisible river to where they will in time be counted by recording angels and so carried to his credit in the book of remembrance There are always pilgrimages going on somewhere They certainly do great good to railroad receipts At Cairo I witnessed the entry into the city of the pilgrims returning from Mahomet s tomb at Mecca, and saw on Jordan's banks the arrival of the pilgrims of the Greek Church, who come to bathe there at the place where John baptised Jesus I met in France a crowd from London going on a pilgrimage to some place, Lourdes I believe, where a church has been newly erected in a lately used grazing paddock, to commemorate the apparition there of the Virgin to a little shepherdess We are all pilgrims, in fact, and our trouble is to know from whence and whither Travel tends to make one very tolerant Until the day comes when we shall know who and what is right, who shall say that others and their doings are wrong I am shown here, in a vault of the fort that the great Akbar built, a banyan tree that has been growing for fifteen hundred years, which is quite likely of that species of tree As each branch droops to the earth, and there roots itself and grows I do not see why the tree should not live for ever It should be used as the symbol of immortality This being a sacred tree, had been built around when the building was raised It is now shown to me by torchlight for one rupee Around its roots are images of gods and idols, looking as much out of place there as itself does On one side of this vault is an opening bricked around liketothemouthof a sewer My guide interpreted thus-" That leads, theorist says, straight to the sacred city of Benares -a place distant many hundreds of miles from this city of Allah The object of the tunnel I could not learn It is not good to ask many questions on matters of faith A sacred and invisible stream, the Sereswati, is said to run through this tunnel The Palace of the Moguls here is now used as a sort of manner store-full of cannon and cannon balls shells, sappers tools, swords, guns, ropes, and shot belts The wants of horse and foot soldiers and engineers can all be here supplied Akbar was a great warrior, and his ghost, may be, would not choose to see the present use of his palace, its grand halls and seraglio To a sent j mental traveller, however, it looks a shame to turn a palace into a hardware store, and it is nothing better than that now-this palace of imperial Caesar dead and turned to clay " The native show of this city is the poorest looking town I have yet seen Allahabad expects great things as coming-the number of its hotels indicate that it is a sort of Washington city at present in its distances and incomplete appearance, and will, it is expected, be more Washington city like in its characteristics as it progresses I am beginning to fear that I shall have little by which to remember it, when my guide takes me to the gardens of Khusru, once a sultan here and a descendant of Akbar This unfortunate man was the victim of a family quarrel on account of which his father, Jehangir, laid siege to his stronghold, and there kept him as prisoner until he died of his vanquished army many hundreds were, day by day, impaled in a long line, and the imprisoned Khusru was then released for a time, and paraded up and down- made, in fact, to hold a horrible review of his soldiery thus served These gardens are entered through an embattled stone wall by a very grand Saracenic gateway, of fifty five feet high, and of about the like thickness Inside are well kept gardens to be seen, and three fine mausoleums, having lofty marble domes, that date back to 1929 How we blunder into trouble' I am offered at the barracks a seat on one of a string of camels that is going two miles or so out to bring in fodder Without the fore thought of him who doubted his untried ability to fiddle, I rashly accepted the offer It turned out a serious matter, as they will acknowledge who may try first time to ride on a camel It is necessary first to get upon him As he stands too high to be reached, he has to come down to one which he does until his stomach touches the ground He descends in three sections As his legs are very long, nature provides for his pushing his hinder ones outwards from the body, so that they stick out behind like to two tram rails To my notice he is singular among animals in that matter of his hind legs in bringing his body to the ground he first descends to the knees of his front legs Then he comes down on those of his hinder ones, and as they are situated just where the legs join the body, the drop down is a great one The third movement is that in which the front knees double, and the whole body comes to the ground. It is then seen that there is not room under the short body for all the four long legs In the face a camel looks as mild and harmless as a sheep, but he is not to be touched by everybody, and is more Bnappisht than he looks his under lip hangs some. what, thereby showing teeth of an unpleasant yellowish brown He is guided by a queer arrangement. It is a conically Bhapetl pe_, the smaller end of which is pushed a youth one nostril, so that the larger end a left inside barb like To the Burall protruding and a thin rope is attached, which, in the riders hands, is all the guiding power used 'to strangers it looks only likely to be useful on one side but then everything cannot be understood at once, and I never cared about camels twice Steps are provided for in) reaching the saddle, which article I find on getting up to it has crossed pieces of wood rising up to front and back Between these I am to see my. self, and, when I do so, think that these are very necessary Such wooden fencing m would be better, I soon think, if it went all round one The driver now mounts on a sort of crupper at the rear of the back woodwork and pulls at the beasts nose, whereupon trouble begins There are no stirrups nor any grip to be got with ones legs The first upward movement of the camel is to his fore knees throwing one suddenly backward Then comes the movement of his long back lets, and I think I am going to be thrown over the cross trees, and over his head on to mine I believe the driver caught me some where about the waistband, or below it or I must have gone over The third movement, to the feet of the fore CLS, again throws one backwards, but in this backward movement there are the front cross pieces to hold on to which I do with a grip that cramps the fingers The elevation attained on a tall camels back, and this was of the tallest, is beyond all expectation 'The feeling of helplessness also quite matches with it. One has had enough throwing about backwards and for wards, but now comes a rocking, from side to side as the animal rolls along the it but for a vigorous hold of the front wood work would inevitably bring one to the dust The camel does not move his legs like to a horse, but is a survivor of that antediluvian world in which animals moved the same side legs together Such movement is quite a barbarity to the rider, and especially so when the height from the ground and the absence of stirrup support are considered There is plenty of time to consider it up where I was A new form of punishment might be devised for heavy offenders, instead of the lash Judgment might be thus passed, after specifying the term of confinement The sentence of the Court is, further, that thrice during the term of your imprisonment you be placed on a camels back and trotted for half an hour at a time around the prison yard being placed on again each time you shall fall off ' My camel only walked Not for duke- dogs would I have had him trot Had he gone that far the dukedom would have been little use to me If the prisoner so sentenced, as I have supposed, escaped breaking his neck or his arms and legs, and dislocating his collar bone and shoulders, he would still be unable to move his aching limbs for a week afterwards Save with galling pain A hardened criminal might, as he often does stand the lash without quivering, but that camel ride, and its w reaching trot, would shake his bones and nerves would touch the heart of the most obdurate and bring it into his mouth All the trouble of the camels getting up was repeated on his getting down again, only in reverse order I thought that I had fallen through a window, and was going head fore- most into the street; with such a sudden drop did he come to his knees I never felt so glad to get out of any trouble as I did out of that saddle My guide told me that I could only avoid returning in that way by going on foot for the long two miles. I said I would gladly walk twenty. Go back again in that fashion ' Ask the weary bird blow n o'er the deep again to quit its shore' I am wondering next day why the balls of both thumbs are so painful and one s Impera BO stiff. It is the effect of the gripping hold that I took of the cross pieces of that camel's saddle I know now, and not till now, how strong had been the clutch, and how long and unre laxed had been the strain upon the muscles. Camel riding, to be enjoyed, should be commenced early in life, and its first lessons taken under careful superintendence When in Syria, some months later, I found that the dromedary riders faced themselves up In tight corsets, like to a modern belle, when they went on their journey and I know the reason why. Much packing up is wanted for a continuance of the fearful shaking the rider then gets Brain fever has been known to ensue from it, and a loose tooth is removed, without any aid from the forceps, before the ride is ended And yet I have read in books of travel of folks who write of riding on a camel as if it were a stranger course. It is, in fact, as impossible to do it at first effort as it is to swim without previous practice Such people would tell of their adventures in snow shoes, utterly ignores the long practice that would be necessary to a successful use of them It is better to own one's ignorance and toll of one's failures and inability to do at a first trial that which the commonest sense tells us must be learnt by much practice I had thoughts of bathing at the same junction, and dropping a handful of hairs therein, but my host dissuaded me The Hindoos might take offence at it. It was a hard thing to tear oneself away without so investment this Allahabad Grand Junction Eternal Life Insurance, but I left without effecting the floating policy. Perhaps in so doing I saved the choking of a few fishes, and I let it go at that when regretting thus leaving the City of Allah
