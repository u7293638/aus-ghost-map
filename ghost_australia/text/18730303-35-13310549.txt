THE LAND. (From the Sydney Mail, March 1.) OUR private advices from London speak of the WOOL MARKET in the following terms : " The wool market is easy, and prices will no doubt be good at the February sales, and I am in hopes that the French will be in force, as the new Commercial Treaty is likely to prove unworkable." Messrs. Jacomb, in their circular, furnish a tabu- lar statement compiled from the catalogues of the wool offered at the London colonial sales of 1871 72, from which some important facts are obtain- able concerning the wool trade. It shows that while the quantity of wool offered by auction during 1872 was 93,000 bales less than in the preceding year, the money value increased for the smaller quantity more than «£2,000,000-that is to say from ¿15.000,000 to ¿17,000,000, which may be considered the accurate value of the colonial clip : Bales.

The value per bale in 1871, according to the statement referred to, was £20 ; and £26 in 1872 : being a rise of 13 per cent. It seems that these gentlemen and their constituents, the buyers, are alarmed at the combination taking place in these colonies _ amongst the growers. Their gains being in jeopardy, they must combine too-or rather re-combine-for it was to defeat the previous concerted action on their part that made it necessary for the growers to look more sharply after their own interests. A writer in the European Mail says The buyers at the London and Colonial wool sales held in London, alarmed at the sale of wool at Melbourne without any allowance for draft, have exclaimed against " the innovation," and on December 2 they held a meeting at the sale room to give expression to their views upon the subject. There was a large attendance, but I cannot say whether all present were buyers. Anyway, before the chairman opened the proceedings, there was quite a Babel of tongues, for Germans, Frenchmen, and Belgians were all talking together, and with such a considerable amount of muscular action as really to astonish the cool Anglo- Saxon observer. There were a few brokers present, watching the proceedings with an air of unconcern, and here and there were a few brokers' clerks, who had evidently been sent " to report progress." According to Mr. Moore, the chairman, the matter was one for the buyers. It was their rights that were then opened. The growingfraternityattheCapewere quiet enough on the subject, if not in the buyers' favour, and the only parties to be dealt with were a few cantankerous gentlemen " connected with Australia Melbourne and Sydney in E articular,-who had distinguished themselves" by their most profound ignorance of the trade." But supposing these few gentlemen succeeded in abolishing " draft," he put it to the buyers what í they would do, and by way of quickening their decision he gave them his advice. " There is but one course to pursue, namely, not to bid for any wool where the draft is not allowed." So then we are in for a struggle, for this is precisely the course marked out by the growers to sell the bale at the scale weight without addition or subtraction. In estimating the issue we have of > course to consider whose necessity will lead them to give in first whether the buyer can get on longest without the wool, or the grower without the money. Supposing the Australian gentlemen were united in this matter Cape wool would go up, that is certain ; but the London buyers would find it queer work to satisfy their needs and keep their machinery going with 127,790 bales in place of 639,620. Sir. Jowitt, one of the speakers, and a large , buyer, referred the meeting to the memorial protesting against the proposed changes,? and signed last year by 449 buyers, including the leading firms in England and abroad conjured them to maintain the attitude then assumed. It was then stated that the buyers would firmly resist all attempts to abolish draft, and should they now draw back? He said further The meeting, and all the gentlemen who signed that document, were now called upon to show that their signatures were not be treated as so much waste paper, and that they dared the merchants connected with the Australian colonies to carry out their intention. If it was right for the sellers to say they would not soil without draft, it was equally right for the buyers to say they would not buy without draft. (Loud and continued applause.) At one time it was tried to abolish the draft in the tea trade, but the buyers resisted it, and the tea trade continued as heretofore. That he considered was a good precedent for the buyers in the wool trade to act in a similar way. As the time of the meeting was short, and as his own views were tolerably well expressed in the resolution he had to submit to the meeting, he would lose no time in proposing it. He then moved, " That the buyers here present distinctly announce their adherence to the memorial to the importers, dated December 1871, which was signed by 469 firms, including nearly all the English and foreign buyers, whereby they expressed their determination to resist any attempt to abolish draft, on three groundsel. Because it has been a custom over since the foundation of the colonial wool trade. 2. Because draft, or an equivalent for draft is allowed not only on wool, but also on every article of produce sold by public auction. 3. Because, on account of the allowance for draft numberless claims for super-tares and short-weights are foregone which would otherwise be pressed, and if pressed would entail much trouble both on buyers and brokers. Understanding that an attempt may shortly be made by the Australian woolgrowers to abolish this allowance, the buyers here present resolve that they will decline to bid for any wool that may be offered without the customary allowance for draft." Mr. Rhodes, of Bradford, seconded the resolution. In support of it Mr. Joachim said The matter was clear enough to all who would give it a moment's consideration. The buyer, in bidding for wool at a sale, had to bid for a bale in each bale there was a certain quantity of moisture, and. to protect themselves against losses arising from this, it was nothing but right that they should be allowed the draft, which, generally speaking, only amounted to 1 per cent. He was well aware that in Germany they had recently been selling wool without any allowance for draft ; but were the buyers in the largest metropolis in the world going to take their instructions and regulations from foreigners f He thought not, and was of opinion that the buyers who attended the London sales would still retain their 1 per cent., and on no occasion bid for any wool where the draft was not allowed. It gave him great pleasure to support the resolution, and if only the buyers united and stood their ground, he had no hesitation in saying that they would come off victorious. M. Picrrard,addressing the meeting French, said there was no doubt this- question was one of the greatest importance, not only to the English buyers, but also to those who attended from the Continent, and he would urge them in one united body to give in their adherence to the resolution. He hoped that when put to the meeting, it would be unanimously adopted, find that the brokers would support them in their views. Among the Continental buyers there were representatives of the largest leading houses, and as he knew that the English buyers were all influential gentlemen, he little Jfcored but that; united more common body, they would win the day, and continue to receive that allowance for draft which had been granted them since the establishment of the sales. These resolutions were carried with acclama- tion, and we now see clearly what the buyers mean. Their attitude of defiance is, however, better to be understood than their logic. Those know very well who have studied " The good old rule, the simple plan That they should take who have the power , And they should keep who can," how the affair will end unless some compromise be determined upon. " The squatters, who are in England," writes a London correspondent, are much annoyed with the merchants and brokers that they do not abolish the deduction of one pound per cent, for draft, which is an unequal tax, pressing as it does most heavily on the best got up clips, and I understand they are intending to bring some powerful pressure to bear upon the merchants. But," says the same writer, than whom none knows better the ins and outs of the wool trade, "the great evil of the trade is in allowing the brokers to buy as well as sell, even at their own sales, for they are so well paid by the buyers, who can afford to be liberal when they get bargains and knockouts, and are so much under their personal influence, that some eight or ten of the largest buyers dictate all the terms of sale. The brokers, when they buy and sell, are not free agents. The Conference delegates did one good thing before they separated in agreeing to request the Home Government to charge the Is., duty per gallon on COLONIAL WINES of 35 degrees of proof spirit in place of 26 degrees ; since, as it now stands, the duty precludes the importation in England of the most suitable class of Australian wines. If this request should be granted the way will be opened for a considerable business, for already there are signs of a perceptible change of opinion in respect of Australian vintages. Our wines will in time be esteemed the proper sauce for our meats. The prayer of the memorialists will not be to remove the duty in favour of the colonies. While we tax English-made beer that would never do ; but inasmuch as we do not apply the alcoholic test to beers, we ask that this test shall not be applied to our wines. The duty either side as for revenue is not to be complained of. The New South Wales Agricultural Society receives a lesson from the societies of Victoria and Adelaide in the matter of WINE. Jb'or the forthcoming wine show at Melbourne it is decided that the bottle or bottles put in by the exhibitor must represent 50 dozen of the vintage competing. In Adelaide, where the wine trade, has obtained large proportions, each exhibit of bottled wine is required to represent 100 dozen in stock, whilst bulk exhibits were to consist of 500 gallons each. This was the position first taken by our Society, and there is much reason to regret a departure from it. If no stipulation is made as to the quantity in hand the prize may bring out some very choice wines," as the Australasian says, but will be wholly inoperative in developing wine production. The neighbouring societies are clearly therefore with the Sydney wine stewards in this matter, and opposed to the council. Amongst the recent science announcements in the English papers is to be found one of great importance relative to the power of various SUB- STANCES IN PREVENTING PUTREFACTION and the development of "protoplasm" and fungus life. The agents of which Dr. Calvert principally speaks are those known to him in the course of his experimental researches, namely Agents which prevent the development of protoplasmic and fungus life ; these are carbolic and cresylic acids. Agents which prevent the production of fibre life, but do not prevent the appearance of fungus life ; these are chloride of zinc and bi-chloride of mercury. Agents which permit the production of fibre life, but which prevent the appearance of fungus life sulphate of quinine, pepper, turpentine, and prussic acid. Agents, in the fourth place, which do not prevent the appearance of either proto- plastic or fungus life. Of these twenty-five substances, Dr. Calvert gives the following particulars The acids, while not preventing the production of fibre life, have a marked tendency to promote the growth of fungUS life. This is especially noticeable in the case of sulphuric and acetic acids. Alkalies, on the contrary, are not favourable to the production of fungus life, but promote the development of fibres. Tho chlorides of zinc and mercury, while completely preventing the development of animalcules, do not entirely prevent fungus life. He calls special attention to the interesting and unexpected results obtained in the cases of chlorine and bleaching powder, which he ascertained by a distinct series of experiments, must be used in large quantities, in order to prevent the E reduction of vitriol life. He found that in the case of bleaching powder, part of the carbon was converted into carbonic acid, and part of the nitrogen was liberated. If, however, the bleaching powder be not in excess, the animal matter will still readily enter into putrefaction. The assumption on which its employment as a disinfectant has been based namely, that the affinity of the chlorine for hj danger is so great as to destroy the germs, is erroneous. 11 e calls special attention to the tar series, where neither the carbolic nor the desire acids gave any signs of violence or fungus life during the whole eighty days during which the experiments were conducted. The fact that neither sulphate of quinine or pepper prevent the development of fibre life, but entirely prevent the appearance of fungi, together with the remarkable efficacy of the former in intermittent fever, leads him to the supposition that this form of disease is due to the introduction into the system of the fungUS germs. The results he obtained in the case of charcoal showed that it possesses no antiseptic properties, but that it prevents the emanation of putrid poses, owing to its extraordinary porosity, which condenses , the gases, thus bringing them into contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere, which is simultaneously condensed. This is a subject of special importance, and shows how the chemist, when enabled to follow up investigations in certain directions, may assist the farmer, the stockowner, and the vigneron. What are half the maladies under which they suffer but forms of fungus-the blood diseases of cattle, the swamp cancer in horses, the oidium in vines, rust in wheat. All those diseases common to animals being occasioned by the presence of viruses in the blood, and Dr. Calvert's results should be well studied, as they may be by those who will peruse the paper he read before the British Association at Brighton, by all who would like to be taught a little about the medicine chest of nature, and what can be done with some of the remedies it contains. The Mark Lane Express affords but a dreary picture of the situation and prospects of the English farmer. That journal says The state of the weather has become the permanent source of complaint. The floods, instead of abating, have further increased, and most of our great rivers have over- flowed their banks, entirely swamping the low-lying neighbourhoods. Farmers are literally puzzled what to do their horses getting out of health, for want of work, in the stables, the land hopelessly sodden, and the flail or thrash- ing machine next to useless ; while round our coasts there have been numerous and terrible wrecks. But it is almost dangerous to have a strong front when vegetation is so heavily charged with moisture, and all we can hope for is a I continuance of moderate breezes till the land is in working order. There are many fears that the little wheat already planted will turn out a partial failure, the seed rotting in. the soil and this apprehension is felt on the continent of Europe, where the sowing was more successful, as well as here. This state of things must result in a heavy loss to the country, and a proportionate gain to those who are to supply the deficiency which must be expected, if the statement is true that about one-third the usual area is sown with wheat, and the greater part of what was sown in heavy land lies rotting in the ground, its vital principle having given up the ghost. What with failure of the potato crop, pestilence amongst the cattle and sheep, and weather all against him, the British farmer is not just now an enviable person. The Christmas fat shows were nevertheless highly successful, as those will see who read the sketches in another column. The weights of the prize cattle given will awaken some little surprise amongst our own breaden. DR.
