Bicycle Jack ; or, our Political Franzini. Who, who hasn't gazed on that beautiful scene Where Madame Franzini, the Bicycle Queen, Sweeps round the arena at perilous speed And gracefully sits on her mettlesome steed ? Each night to the Queen's go the nobs and elite To see her performing the bicycle feat ; But Madame Franzini is " sent to the pack," Eclipsed by the skill of one Bicycle Jack. Next time you are passing, stop, reader, and call And witness the feats at Macquarie-street Hall ; For Jack's exhibition is better by far Than that of Franzini the bicycle star. She rides among shrubs with botanical names, And bottles emitting bright kerosene flames ; But Jack licks her modest performance to shreds — He gambols among Parliamentary heads. There's Parkes, and he's pale as a ghost with affright, And Dibbs, and a lot more besides out of sight ; There's Lloyd, he looks anxious, perturbed, and distressed, And peace has deserted his sensitive breast. They've little to say— all too deeply they feel ; They speak not — they're watching the spokes of the wheel ; With half of their wonted hilarity gone, They watch the vagaries of Bicycle John. He cuts along gaily, just shaving poor Parkes, Who cries most devoutly, " John, none of your larks !" And then (by the spirit of mischief upbuoyed) He nearly capsizes the fear- stricken Lloyd. Their peace and their comfort have vanished and fled, The hair of friend Dibbs stands erect on his head, And all, in their minds, would much easier be If Jack were engulfed in the depths of the sea. They shake and they tremble, grow dizzy and sick, And don't seem to fancy this bicycle trick. Each glares like a lioness robbed of her cubs ; They certainly seem to be very " rum-shrubs ." Their features are branded with dread and mistrust, Each fears that he'll shortly be rolled in the dust, Upset and knocked over, laid flat on his back, Capsized, and ejected by Bicycle Jack.
