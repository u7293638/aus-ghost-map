A MOVING APPEAL . TO MR. BARRY SULLIVAN. O, GIVE us back our blood-stained ghost, With gashes on his brow, Who look'd so like a tragic swell From RICHARDSON'S fam'd show. He used to rise so deftly through The slowly-mounting trap, And never winced, whene'er it touched The stage with sudden clap. He shook his head, and pointed to A gory wound on top, And nodded like a mandarin, In some tea-dealer's shop. He ne'er disturbed a single guest At MACBETH'S festive board, And to the KING'S insane remarks He answered not a word. He did not eat the pasteboard fruit, Nor drain the wooden cup; He only came to shake his head— He didn't come to sup. And when he disappear'd from view, Was only missed by one, Who said he felt "a man again" Now that mute guest was "gone." A solid and substantial ghost Was that same bleeding chap, And wide-awake, it must be own'd, Since he was "up to trap." A BANQUO, not a banqueter, A guest beyond all guess; Though unconvivial, yet he brought The host into a mess. A spectre unexpected, he With lustre filled the chair, And full of spirits was his mein, And lively was his (h)air.* Why push him from his stool, B. S.? And from the O. P. post? I urge it in a friendly way— Pray don't give up the ghost. * "Shake not thy gory locks," &c.;
