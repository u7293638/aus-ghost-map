THE GERMANS IN NEW GUINEA. (S. M. Herald, 24th December.) THERE can hardly be a doubt now that posi tive action has been taken by Germany in the Pacific. There may be some doubt as to the precise nature of that action. Whether it has been a formal annexation of territory by the authority of the Imperial Government, with a view to the establishment of a per manent, orderly administration, or whether it has been a mere hoisting of the flag in token that interests acquired by German subjects from the natives by any form of purchase will be recognised and defended by the German Power, may not yet be quite clear. As we re marked yesterday, Prince Bismarck has fore shadowed the adoption of the latter policy The statement in the Standard points to the former Time will show what are the exact facts. Late intelligence places it beyond doubt that posi two action of the one sort or the other has been taken A Berlin telegram of Monday last informs us that " the information received hero from Australia reporting tho hoisting of the Gorman flag at New Britain, Now Ireland, the Admiralty Islands, and portions of the north coast of Now Guinea haa been officially confirmed to day ' Under ordinary circum stances the official confirmation of tho infor mation would be equivalent to an ofticial íecog nition and approval of the action taken If official sanction had not been given to it, so much would presumably havo boon said And jet wo find Mr Murray Smith, after com muiiicating with the Under Secretary for the Colonies, telegraphing fiora London to Mr. Service on Sunday last, "The Govern nient is in communication with Ger many, who is reported as pledged against any such steps, at least m New Guinea. Tho newspapers to day state that the German Embassy has received official intelligence from Berlin declaring that tho report 13 quite unfounded ' Was the German Imibassy in London then, ofh cially misled ' The statement of the Standard in London, coupled with what is practicvlly an ofhcial conln mation of at least a part of it 111 Berlin, pointa to tho conclusion that either tho Embassy waa officially misled, 01 that somebody connected with the Embassy misled tho newspapers In cither case an explanation is required But thero is anothei point requiring explanation According to tho Standard, " England has been awaio of the intentions of G01 many since July ' The alternative hero is that tho Standard has been mismfoiracd or that tho colonies have been misled by tho British Government When instructions were sent out to Commodore Erskine to pro claim a Protcctoiato along the coast line of southern New Guinea stopping short at a fixed point, tho British Government did or did not know what tho desiroa or intentions of Germany with regard to Now Guinea vvcie If the British Government did not know, or undci stood, as Mi Murray Smith's tolcgram implies, that Germany was plcdgod against any annexation in Now Guinea the stopping short 111 the pioclanuition of the Protectorate may bo explained ' Suflicicnt for the day 13 the evil theieof, ' Loid Delby would probably say, "and why should we go another mile along the coast now, if wo can put off the «.tension of tho Protectorate to a latci date ' YVliy do a thing at once when there 13 a poasi bility of doing it by halves V But if England did know, or had icason to suspect, that Germany had an oyo upon the northern coast, or a hankering for it, and deliberately avoided tho extension of the line of the Protectoiate to the no1 them coast w ith the view of obviating trouble and complications, it would havo been at least com tcous to the colonies to candidly acknow ledge tho gi ounds for limiting her action But whethoi tho Biitish Government has been aware or unaware of German intentions, the course actually taken has been ono tending directly to lay tho basis for future troubles and complications instead of obviating thom Tho idea of a coastline Ptotectorate leaving absolutely undotoi mined the distance inland over which tho mfluonco of the pioto"ttng authority might from timo to time bo hold to extend, is peculiar, to begin with Rightly applied, it might have been effective for the pin pose m hand without committing the Go vcinmont to responsibilities from which it desired to romain fi ce But to bo rightly ap plied it should havo been applied to tho whole coast lo establish a Piotectorato along tho southern coast hue only, was to leave it open to any other Power-almost as if by tacit invita tion-to deal with the noithein coast line and the whole territory inland. Tho man who wants to protect a paddock against trespass is not content with a fence on only one side The direct consequence of England's defec- tivo action will be that sooner or latci negotia- tions must bo opened with Germany to determino inland boundaries. The chief object of setting up a Protectorate on tho coast only was to avoid the responsibility of administeiing government in the mtorioi But by leaving the ground open for Germany to intervene, England has brought about tho necessity for determining some day where German territory ends, and wheie the territory under British protection begins, and up to that boundary British authority wdl then have to b<> maintained Under present appearances, at any rate, Lord Derby's policy tin catons to defeat its own ends, Tho almost inevitable re- sult of it would seem to be to compel Great Britain to extend tho protectorate from the original terminal point along the noithcrn coast until the German limit is reached, and to follow that up by asserting authority over the territory that lies between If the idea of a coast-line Protectorate should not now be ox changed for that of a territorial Protectorate, England will practically leave tho kernel to Germany, and hold on to a fragment of the Bhell. In this matter Lord Derby has undervalued tho interests of the colonies and overlooked the truo interest of the Empire. He was m a certain scnBO obliged to repudiate the pro- ceedings of Sir Thomas Ai'Ilwiaith, taken without authority in the Queen's name. But by failing to do immediately afterwards with authority what the Queensland Government undertook to do without, he missed the turn of the tide, and involved himself m difficulties which both his inaction and his action havo only tended to increase. It is a mistake to say that the colonies could have protected their interests moro effectually against Ger- many if they had been independent, or if they had established a Federal Council If Germany has not shrunk from committing an runfnendly act towards Great Britain, the begard of an independent Australia would have ccn very I lghtly esteemed. The opinion of the colonies in the matter of New Guinea has been unanimous It could not have been ex- pressed with greater emphasis by a council of fourteen. But it is bad for both the Imperial and the colonial cause when a Secretary of State for the Colonies undervalues their in- terests, fails to sympathise with their legiti- mate desires, shuts his ej es to their future, and treats them in the present with scant con- fidence. If Lord Derby is not open to these charges, the defence that is to clear his reputa- tion must be stronger than anything which now appears, (Melbourne Argus, 33rd December.) The news with regard to the German annexa- tion in the Western Pacific seems now to be believed in London Our cable message from London states that the Standard has announced that the German Government has formally notified the Eui opean Powers that it has taken over half-a dozen of the Pacihc groups ; that the New Britain archipelago has been brought under the flag, and that, in addition, a protec- torate over the northern portion of New Guinea has been proclaimed It is quite evident that there has been some coup in these waters, and the only question is as to its extent With regard to the islands we need not say anything to day, but with regard to New Guinea it can- not be declared too early nor too strongly that Australia has a right to protest with bitterness and with strength against the recognition of any German claim If tho Earl of Derby can- not keep German hands off Papua, then Aus tralla has been duped by the Secretary of State The plain word of the Imperial Government will have been broken When Sir Thomas Mcilwraith first hoisted the flag m New Guinea, and took possession of the unoccupied half of the island, it was because of the uneasiness felt with regard to Germany, and when the Earl of Derby disal- lowed that action, he treated the fear as to Germany as a m j th and a bugbear. Germany, we were told, had no intentions, so far as the Papuan island was concerned, and, moreover, it waa alleged that any settlement upon the coast of New Guinea by any foreign Power would be regarded as an unfriendly act Sir Thomas M'llwraith replied in words which may vv eli be quoted - Not only has Lord Dorby'a despatch failod to allay tho approhonsious of tho Australian peoplo as to tho POBaiblo occupation of New Guinea bj- a foroign Powor, but they havo derived aa Iitllo comfort from his statement in Parliament that the formation of a sottloment on tho coast of th it Island by such a1 Power would bo rogardod by hor Majesty's Government as an unfriendly act» At tho stago at vvhlch the act could bo regarded as an unfriondly ono, it must havo boon already accomplished, b<| that Lord Dorby'a words aro oithor o moro prognostication of regret or a that nor Ma'oaty'sGovornmont would Bubmlt the mattor to tho arbitrament of war. doolaration t But this was no); all. Lord Derby, in the des- patch which haa been quoted so often, specifi- cally pledgod Great Britain to establish a pro- tectorate over the eastern coaat of New Guinea if Australia wonld guarantee a certain sum to- wards oxpenses. That guarantoo was given at once. But no! ono can soy that tho pledge would bo redeemed by creating a protectorate over the southern shores of Eastern New Guinea alone,land by leaving tho northern shores to the foreign Powor which wo were led to believe had no intentions in that quarter. So soon as Lofd Derby learns of any Gormau designs bia pliin duty is to intimate that ho has delayed th* Australian occupation of Now Guinea for a ¡time pending inquiry and ar- rangements, but that tho unannexed portion of the island has been definitely promised to the coloniats, and that, therefore, a foreign settlement ia impossible. Firm language of this character must havo its offect, and, ihdecd, courtesy alone would pro- bably induce Prince Bismarck not to interfere, more especially as Germany ia not interested tothoextont of a penny íiiecointhe island. Nota copra collector has hia hut on tho coast, nor do tho Samoan sclioonors use the harbours. The bCche-de-raer stations are thoso of tho Queens- land fishers, and the resident white men are either Australian pioneers or tho able, zealous, and successful representatives of tho London Missionary Socioty. There is not the ghost of a German claim. The national desire of Aus- tralia to possess tho land is well known, and the promise made to her by England stands recorded in half-a-dozon official documents, and no German whim should be allowed to prevail against both. Otherwise, the situation would bo unjust to both countries. Eastern Now Guinea is composed for the most part of a long peninaulo, little more than 1C3 miles in breadth, and if Germany Ina ono sido and England the other, thoa it ia certain that trouble muat ensuo. Given such a position, and offenders can escapo from the one jurisdiction to the other. A tribe at conllict with the one Power can obtain arms from tho other, and retreat into tho fastnosaes of the neutral country. To reo'ise the position, we havo only to imagino Taranaki in possession of one nation, and tho YY'oikato owned by another. The peaceful government of New Zealand under such circunutanccs would havo been an impossibility. Tno episode of the Stanley schooner shows of itself the adviaablc ncss of not bringing two European nationa into communication with each other in an un civitiaed country-even if there were not the hiBtory of Amorica and of India to study-and it would bo absurd to arnnge for the transfer of the recent unfortunate strife between Ger- man and Australian trolera in the Lachlan Isles to New Guineo. Dangoi seems to be in tho air, and as chair man of tho Convention Cimmittoo Mr Servico will, wo presume, castibout lum to see if joint action is possible, a remind the Earl of Derby of his pledge, aucto insist upon its io dcmption. What Anstnlia ought to do at this jnncturo is to dcniind that good faith should bo kept with us, aid that the annexa tion of Eastern Now Cuinoa should bo "no longei delayed TboSecctary of Stnto should be made to understand that if ho loses New Gtntica ho will stand befire the English people charged with having plajed false to Australia, and with having dono h s utmost to shako the confidence and to abeiato tho affection of those colonies, and no English statesman w ill care about I facing nn lamest accusation of that kind Wo should ipproach the Throne with a piayei for Ins dismissal If proper representations aie nov made, Lord Doiby mayiealise that tho somer a situation that alai ms and in itates m ths raannei ib onded the bcttci.

A) colonists weean conceivo of no bargain which can justify such a base surrender to a forcigi Power of territory that is geographically as nuch an integral part and farcel of the Austnluin continent as Phillip stand is a part of Vittoria YVo havo nothing o say against the Power which has been fortunate enough to find such an admirable uistriincnt of aggrandisement ready to hand as lord Derby. In the great game of grab, Germiny has as much right to take what she can ?et aa any of her neigh- bours. Colonial ecpansion being the new card which tho disnnguiahed Chancellor who shapes the policy of his Imperial Master has decided upon plnyug, such a tempting prize as New Guinea vas not to bo let pass out of mero regird to Australian sus- ceptibilities. Orr indignation will bo concentrated upon tho advisers of the Queen, who not ony to all appearance have not moved a finger t> protect our claims, but, on tho contrary, ha'e stood by and consented to tho act of depredition which baa been com- mitted at our expmse, and in spite of our earnest protests on! entreaties. Wo cannot reproach ourselves nth having left anything undone to gain our end, and to conciliate the goodwill of Lord Derby and his colleagues. Although the moro hr-sccing part of the com- munity were not înposcd upon by his now infamous May dcspitcb, which seemed to his claqueurs in the colon/ to promise everything we wanted, we ncycrtheless never suspected that it was penned with the design of quieting our importunities fir the time being, and staving off tho necessity for action till the negotiations which are now known to have been going on witi Prince Bismarck were finally disposed of. When our correspondent in London warned in that the despatch was a bogus one, and thit the interpretation put upon it by Lord Derby's colonial faulors had been virtually disavowed by him, a great out- cry waa raised on ha behalf, and all Victorian flunkeydom rallied o the defence of his coro- net. How quickly hey havo repented of their misplaced confident ia shown by their eager- ness now to assist ir tearing his reputation to cutters ; but had ¿tey exercised a little more sagacity when the juncture required it, thero can be no doubt thal they would havo done the cause which they pretended to have at heart moro good. Lord Derby found that he had auccccded in blinding the eyes of the party in the colony that he was most anxious to keep quiet, and while his praises were being sung and the best possible intentions attributed to him, ho waa complet- ing the terms of his bargain with Prince Bis- marck, to whom he has sold us. It is a moat humiliating tlnng to say of a statesman with English blood in hu veins, but how else shall his conduct be described' New Guinea was within our grasp. It was part of our patri- mony. Our people were waiting the signal to colomse it ; and without our being consulted, without our having an opportunity of knowing what was going on, we wake up to find that a foreign Power has effected a lodgment upon it, and that the whole territory may at any moment bo lost to us 1 What we Bhall beat do toshoar our resent- ment must be left to oui representatives to deliberate upon.

Germany is evidently bent upon a carcor of peaceful conquest, which is but poorly disguised undci the namo of colonisation.
