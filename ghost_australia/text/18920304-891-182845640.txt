TRAMP ABROAD ASAIH. . Mark Twain is from the point of view of the monarchist an incorrigible writer, who must be haunted bj the ghosts of all the crowned poten tates who have died since first man or woman attempted to reign over his or her fellows, whether succesfully or unsuccessfully f from the time the world was sent whirling through space. In hi* books he has times oat of number shown that be has absolutely no reverence for heredi tary emperors, kings, orprinces, or their feminine j equivalents. He was once a " Tramp Abroad," and now he is a "Tramp Abroad Again." When abroad again—"abroad " to be taken in its American sense as meaning the "Conti nent," and the "Continent" to be taken in its English sense as meaning Europe— he visited Bayreuth. There his republicanism was shocked because at the grand theatre in which Wagner's operas are interpreted as they are nowhere else, the audience, when nothing else was going on, occupied their time in rapturously gazing at the boxes in which sat princes and princesses and now and again monarchs. This roused Mark, and, as has been said, he was shocked, aud he haswritten | some very sarcastic passages about the custom. Then in a digression he crosses to monarchical England. He tells how he was once the guest of some English friends of his in London. One cold day they went out, and dinner had been ready half an hour before they returned, frozen. In explanation they said it had been expected that the Prince of Wales would drive out of Marlborough House gates, but they learnt after waiting some time that the prince changed his mind. Mark Twain asked his host and hostess whether they had not seen the heir apparent before, and they said, "Eifty times." "Well," drawled the humourist—he doesn't say he drawled, but he must have done so—" I would not, under simi lar circumstances, have waited to see even General Grant."
