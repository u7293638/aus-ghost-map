This irili givj solidity to the ring and confidenoe to the b&okers;, who_ if they are oocagiotsslly shorn will ^at their money if they do win. They will wager with 'triad men, who have stood the brunt of many a battle. This will perhaps be so far satisfactory that oven the -totalis&tor; may be forgotten and shelved. But they .are the capitalists in the transaction, tho real Con,£ servatives of Hie racecourse, therefore must be the : 'proper persons to tax.

In addition to the i5100 given by the A.J.C., Tattersall's Club have signified their inten tion of giving .£25 a year if a suitable person, is eocured, and the Sydney Turf Club will, no doubt, supplement it With'a like amount.

The proposed con ference between the committees of the V.B.C. and of the betting rooms has act yet bsen absolutely arranged, -bat is likely soon to take place, as several leading members of each are very decided in their opinions as to the advisability of the plan. It is rumoured that a match at; two miles between First Water and Savanaka is Hot at all unlikely. The. weight to bocarried is Sst 71b. fora stake of ,£10,000. Mr. Pile, the owner of First Water, has made the offer. . - , ; A singular coincideno » occurred lately in America. A jockey named Aiken piloted a horse named Foxhall to victory, in a mile spurt, and two days later met bis' death on a filly named Primrose, when the mare fell,^ and both she and her rider were killed, the race being won by a gentleman of the name of Buchanan. vIt will be remembered that H'Donald, who rode the great Foxhall to victory in the Cesarewitch, was af terwards killed by a fall from, a horse called Bucha nan, in the Liverpool Cup. The fatality attendant on. the names of Foxta.ll and Buchanan in the above' events is, to say the least, very singular. That very unsuccessful .horse Auckland has been showing to the front in New Zealand, . saving won a iSlOO handicap under ''the name of Maori. ' i On Monday, the following horses were disposed ofi at Kirk's bazaar : — Aibyn at 340 guineas, to Mr. £.- O'Brien ; Billy Nutts at 60 guineas, to Mr. Cripps ; and Greyhound to Mr. W. C.
