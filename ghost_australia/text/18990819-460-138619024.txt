TOPICSOFTHEWKK. The Turner Ministry "loafs" on the neighbouring colonies for legislative novel ties. A few years back, when we had for cible men m office, Victoria set the ex ample, and otir neighbours followed. So it was with railway management, public service reform, factory legislation, the de velopment of the dairying industry, Ac. But the Turner Ministry gets its leading measures from the "old do? shop, and, patching them here and there^ presents them to hon. members as something quite new. Its Old Age Aoama MB is * dead copy of the New Zealand aet^ with trifling alterations that scarcely unpro&e; the pat* tern. In brief, paaoiu anodftkl to £18 a year are to be paid to men and women aged 65 and -upwards, who hare lived in Victoria for 25 years.

But i: they have any sense of that Jcind that i: sjiccial to themselves, -thef:eta laa^e it nunite't, and make it £elt, too, without :!ie franchise. The potent authority in poli ties is not Parliament, but public feeling, as ha- been abundantly proved by the vote on federation, which not a aiagie Parlia menr took kindly to till the question had been settled by public feebng.

SJealdn, Sir, Wfctts, and others rat the Towflihall on Mondayf An argument, employed by no lees tin authority than Herbert Spencer, for keeping things as they are is that the suffrage is for the sex that has to fight. Fixing that argument on the ^Legislative Council, Mr. Deakin, with the airy 'lightness that makes his words ever sound pretty, proceeded to ask —''How would some of the -grave and reverend gentlemen who sat in the Upper 'Chamber like to be sent for a cruise on a night attack in one of our -torpedo-boats -out through the Rip? -Or would they be any better than women if asked to sleep on the wet ground at the Easter encamp ment?" It need hardly be said that these satirical questions were re ceived with drawingroom delight. "Put some of the legislators of the Upper House in the field, and he was satisfied that the kilt would not be long enough to hide them. (Laughter.) They would be flying to the petticoat for shelter." {Great laughter.) It is not easy to -tell how much physical courage is to be found in one House or the other, But if moral courage and physi cal courage go together, then the Legisla tive Assembly, which votes for petticoat suffeage off-hand, and may consequently be said to be flying to the petticoat for shelter, comes vary -badly off in comparison with the Legislative Council. From the Premier downwards. tbe ^members of Mr. Bealdn's House are conspicuous for their cleverness in shirking fightable questions. They all like to count heads before they decide on battle. Immediately prior to the meeting of Parliament this session, members were giving out in the street, in the trains, and in other places where public opinion forms itself how they would teach Minis berg a lesson (or threatening the privileges of members. As soon as Ministers heard of this they proceeded to count beads, so as to determine whether they should fight or cavr in, and they took care, as a counter move, to spread the suggestion that Minis terial defeat would lead to immediate dis solution. What became of the moral courage of Mr. Deakin's House then ? The Assembly was speedily reduced-Ministers and supporters alike-to the state which Mr. Knight says is the perpetual condition of the degenerate Moslems in Kashmir. Ministers and supporters were equally afraid to hit each other, and the}' spun out the debate till an acute-minded representa tive {who was himself unwilling to put the gloves on) discovered that by referring the question to tbe standing -orders committee it could be neatly shelved, the privileges of members nominally vindicated, and the prestige of Ministers nominally saved. When Mr. Deakin says that he is sorry that the franch ise-which it is feareo may make womwi manly-has "not had that effect on some of tbe men who already enjoy it," he is calling (attention in a very pointed manner t© the effeminate Chamber of legi« Jation of' Wbieh be is a shining and appro | priate ornament. Tbe A.N.A. seems anable to make up its mind definitely whether to go on with the art union on Anniversary Day or to drop ! it. Each time tbe question comes up in association conference or metropolitan com-1 mittee the decision changes?. At present, the vote is go on. It is difficult to see anything wicked in the annual drawing. Them never was any idea that it was wicked till the committee, in a guilty way, tried to hide the fact that an innocent gamble was taking place. So long as the first prise was in money, the second a cot tage, and the third a trip to Europe, there was bo pretence, and, therefore, no con sciousness of wrong-doing. The Anniver sary Committee needed a large gathering in tfwExhibition-building, and they sought to obtain it' by the same means that all the friendly societies employ, viz., by promis ing every tieket-bnyer that he should have a chance inabig lottery. A shilling sweep, for such a purpose, is as proper per se as any shilling or sixpenny drawing that takes place at the feira that are got up" for St. Patrick's Cathedral or the Catholic Or phanage.

'Norton i claims to be a dergyman's son, and tlidre j is a proverb telling tie What Bitch sons are sometime^ like. No entertainment is to be derived from a study of the details. The delinquencies alleged wefe mostly of a vtiH gar, commonplace kind. Mr. HJeath, ML.

Said Mr. Justice Ooben, in Iris tniormiiig-up, "The evidence seems to be overwhelming, and it may be considered that Mr. Norton has admitted that, previous to Aiine or July, 1898, he was addicted to occasional, if not numerous, outbursts of drunkenness." Whether or not Norton is such a person as he is described to be would be a ques tion of no consequence were he not in the Legislative Assembly and the Sydney City Council, where he takes every opportunity of making himself noticeable. And he con-: ducts a newspaper which devotes itself to proclaiming the virtues of John Norton; and to exposing or liinting at the moral failings of every public man he thinks it safe to fcfcve a fling at. If the trial should result in Sir. Norton's disappearihg at an early date from Parliamentary and tnuni cijral life, the expense the Crown has been put to will not have been wasted. He has up to the present cost the state a good deal in. law expenses-many times the average citizen's share. Provided he ceases to be conspicuous, he may enjoy life in any way be pleases, for it cannot be said that his powers for good or evil are of a kind that make him an object of public concern. AH that is desired is rest and oblivion. The problem to come up for decision during the nest yearor two (unless Mr. Norton volun tarily resigns) is how far men of his stamp suit the taste and fulfil the needs of some kinds of Parliamentary electors in New South Wales, and some kinds of ratepayers jn the city that wanted to be the capital of federated Australia. Much amusement can be extracted, at the distance of 1,000 miles, froin the screaming arguments which the Brisbane anti-bfllite press is putting forward against (she adoption by Queensland of the Federal Constitution Hill. It is too greatly excited to notice how the objections contradict and neutralise each other. Thus it prints the complaint of Mr. Lesina, M.L.A., that the constitution fails to provide for majority rule. The constitution cannot be altered without the consent of a majority of the states as well as a majority of the people. This double provision was inserted in the constitution for the express benefit of colonies like Queensland and South Aus tralia, so that they should be able to hold their own against the two populous colonies. Brisbane anti-billites cry out that the constitution cannot be easily altered. Is not this one of the safeguards of Queensland, which knows what kind of .partnership it is entering into, but would not know what it was committing itself to if the constitution might be varied at any .time by a single majority vote? The "Telegraph," in the same breath in which it says that Queensland has nothing to gain from Australian union, cracks up the benefits Queensland may hope for from what seems meant for a "business'' federation with the Japs and the Chinese. |0t appears to be fonder of the yellow man tJian of its own kith and kin.

Sensible remark's oh the Subject will be found in the "Saturday ^Review." With regird to the greatest .works, Such as the "Iliad," the. "Divine Comedy," "Don Quixote," and ?'Hamlet," the question hardly arises, as they appeal alike to the multitude aiid to the critic, and to che generati6rK,after another. It is with bodies of a louver order that the diffi culty cbmes In. Compare, for instance, the vast vogue of "East Lyn'ne" land TiipperV "Proverbial Philosophy" with the slight recognition given by the public to the poetry and prose of Walter Savage Laridor. As the te\iewer siiys:-"The uriost ardent advocates ol' popularity as tin index of literary merit -will hardly press their Theory to such a length'^. as to account for these facts, the true explanation seems to be something like thig. 'Passing popularity is no test of merit, and this is what we generally lhink of when we use the term. The appreciation of readers in sueefeive generations or centuries counts for a great' deal. Probably more copies Of "The Mys tery of a Hansom Cab" have been sold than of "The Vicar of Wakefield." Gold smith's story, however, has.been read and admired for over a century. Is the "shilling ] shocker" likely to stand such a test? In 3806 the popularity of Mrs. Agnes Maria Bennett was immense (probably as great as that of Marie Corelli to-day), and of her six-volume novel, "Vicissi tudes Abroad, or the Ghost of My Fathc-r," 2,000 copies were sold on the day of issue, although the price was 36/. Jane Austen made little impression on the public of her day, though her merits were recognised by Scott. It would not be easy now to procure a copy of "Vicissitudes Abroad," as it has not been reprinted in re cent times, but three or four excellent edi tions of Miss Austen's novels have been published within as many years, and her re putation continues to grow. As the "Saturday Review" says, "Whilst the num ber of times a book is read gives little in dication of its merit, the number of times which it is re-read is a test of the most valuable kind, and ten men who read a book ten times over form a weightier pub lic than two hundred men who devour it eagerly once, and never feel a temptation to open its pages afterwards." It does not follow that a book which achieves great ephemeral popularity, followed afterwards by everlasting oblivion, has no merit.; Even the platitudes of Tapper and the crude sensational effects of .some of our pre sent-day authors have Something in them that appeals to readers of the time. But they faH flat on later generations, which tak£ no interest in the temporary follies and fashions of their predecessors, and will only give ear to bygone writers who depict the permanent aspects of human nature and the passions that endure.
