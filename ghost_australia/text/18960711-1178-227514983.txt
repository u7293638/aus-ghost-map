GEORGE REID "The Promise" The Fulfilment (With Apologies to Trilby, By An Uncivil Servant.) Oh! don't you remember your promise, George Reid, Your promise of times so bright ? We yelled with delight whon you sneered at George Dibbs, And cheered when you carried the fight. The sky is o'ercast with clouds, George Reid, And the land it is mantled with gloom, And dim is the sight of the foreign-trade press, With its search for the foreign-trade boom. Oh, don't you remember your promise, George Reid, In the height of election renown ? The land would be flowing with honey and milk As soon as protection went down, In the old sand-hill in the Park, George Reid, Where the winds over Tucker Hill blow, We have dug out a grave for the ghost of free-trade, And under the ground it will go! Oh! don't you remember, your, words, George Reid, Your words of the loaf, so cheap, When you told us we all would 'grow jolly , and fat And you fooled us with promises steep ? Our billets have gone to the.deuce, George Reid, In thousands we idle around, And the sun of free-trade but a skeleton shows Where you promised the fat would be found. Oh ! don't you remember the spots, George Reid, The spots on the free-trade sun, And the glory you promised would shine on the land â€” .. And the beautiful yarns you spun ? But you've filled our glass to the brim, George Reid, And we're taking it down in nips, And when it is drained to the dregs, George Reid, Then look out for a total eclipse.
