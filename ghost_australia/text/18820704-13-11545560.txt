TUESDAY, JULY 4, 1882, When the proposed abolition of the tea duty was described in the House as a move in the direction of "a free "breakfast table," Sir JOHN O'SHA- NASSY pointed out that the removal of the tax now levied on live stock would answer the purpose just as well. Why the breakfast table should be freed in preference to any other table has never yet been clearly shown. But, assuming that there is some esoteric advantage to be derived from the operation, we would suggest that when the revenue can dis- pense with some of its tributaries the process of liberation should commence by the free admission of sheep, cattle, pigs, supplying the food requirements of the people, furnish the raw material of many industries. That tho country would derive more benefit from the repeal of the duty on stock than it would from the abrogation of the tea duty, does not admit of a doubt. The same may be said of the excise on beor. Both those imposts are so moderate in amount that they do not in any way affect consump- tion or inconvenience the consumer. It is otherwise with the stock tax. Under existing circumstances, when meat supplies aro scarce owing to the late drought, it does much towards en- hancing prices, and so directly affects consumers. While it renders au impor- tant article of food dearer, it cripples trade and industry. It diminishes the operations of the meat preserver, the fellmonger, the tanner, the currier, the bone, horn, and hoof dealer, the shipper of hides, the maker of glue and other small articles ; and of course lessens employment for butchers, cooks, tin- smiths, carpenters, labourers, carters, lightermen, lumpers, ¿re. What states- man in a position to remit taxation would hesitate for one moment between the beer and tea duties and btich a widely operative impost as that on theep and cattle 1 Tho whole différence between scientific finance and " the rule "of thumb" might be exemplified by the choice made between these articles. By relieving stock from the burden now imposed upon it, consumers would be benefited, and some important springs of national industry would be set free ; whereas, repeal of the tea and beer duties would neither advantage the public at large, nor give tho slightest stimulus to production, manufacture, interchange, or trade of any sort. In addition to the general leasons which render the abolition of the stock tax desirable, there are certain special grounds at present for advocating its removal. The loss of sheep and cattle in this colony during the dry season we have just gone through, has been very great. The Bendigo Advertiser, in dealing with this question, makes the following statements : "The .... live Block of our northern plaina having been swept away by the drought and its consequences, those farmers and selectors who have still the means of replacing them Bhould be afforded the only possible opportunity they can have of doing so. . . . Deny them this and their pros- pects as graziers will be utterly destroyed. . . . We ore receiving little or no fat cattlo or aheep from the liiverine diatricte. Owners thereaway object to deal with us in conse- quence of the obnoxiouB toll demanded at the Murray crossings ; and it is an undeniable fact that they have preferred to talco their stock hundreds of miles further than they are from the Victorian markets to markets in their own colony, rather than Bubmit to thia hostile impost. Many of them have Bent, and are still Bending, their stock away to new runa in the far north in Queensland ; and if this order of things continues-and it will continue as long as the Victorian stock tax endures-we shall not only be deprived of the great advantages to be ob- tained by the whole population of the colony by large drafta of fat stock being sent here, but it will ultimately become utterly im- possible to re-stock our northern plains. And through the great demand on the resources of the Western districts and Gipps Land, we shall by and by be placed in such a position that we shall be only too glad to intercept the vessels homeward bound with cargoes of frozen meat from Queensland and New South Wales." The prices ruling at Flomington-yards for some weeks past have shown how the scarcity of fat stock ia beginning to make itself felt. During January, cattle were sold at from £3 10s. to £8 5s., whereas last week the lowest class brought £i 10s, whilst prime pens realised from £12 to £14, and some extra weights as much as £1G. Merino wethers in January brought from 5s. to 9s. Gd,, whereas last week they sold at from 9s. to 15s. Of course some of the difference is to bo accounted for by the extra growth of wnol, but when full allowance has been made for this, it will be seen that a great advance has been established. If this has been done in the green tree, what will be done in the dry 1 The abundant rains with which we have recently been blessed have clothed the country with verdure, but at present there is no nutriment in the herbage. It will be some time before the general warmth of spring can give that succulence to the grasses which repairs waste, and goes to build up tissue. Between now and the end of the year, we may suffer what to us, who are accustomed to a plentiful supply of animal food, will te something like a meat famine. Is it wise at BUCH a time to maintain a tax which increases the cost of a necessary of life? It must be re- membered that bread is exceptionaUy dear just now, as well as meat. It is not only the actual amount, which the stock tax adds to the price of such carcase that has to be taken into con- sideration. The impoBt is regarded as a great grievance by the graziers of Kiverina, and its effect is to render many of them unwilling todo any business with Melbourne .that they can possibly take elsewhere. Few people have any idea of the strength of this feeling, or of the effects it produces. We do not supposa that the squatters of New South Wales are indifferent to profits, but a glance at the prices which fat stock bring in Mel- bourne and Sydney respectively, Bhows that high rates will not always com- mand supplies. Wo have before us a list of the prices realised for sheep and cattle at Homebush on Juno S, and they compare with Flemington values on the 7tb, as follows : Sydney, June-.

There need bo no hesitation in abolish- ing the stock tax, on the ground of the protection it oilers to Victorian farmers, The fact is that by discouraging meat preservers, the duty has, on tho whole, dono them more harm than good. Wo object to the sacrifice of any sourco of revenue during the current year, but if, contrary to all sound and safo financial policy, somo impost must bo taken off, by all means lot tho stock tax go. If statesmanship could have a voice in the matter, no other decision would be pos- sible-for it is a case of sound judgment against a mero claptrap cry. Tho Tai iff Commission is now ap proaclung the most important part of its labours, as it is about to take ovi dence from agriculturists in tho agncul tura! districts The local societies will, it is to bo hoped, bo ready to press their claim for relief \\\ e have been told in Pirliament that if a straw obstructed the farmers it ought to be removed from their path, and i great many straws can bo pointed out Nothing can be moro suggestive of the owl though indirect effect of trammels than such letters as those from tba secretary of the Gisborne shire, Btiting that but for the duty of 2 J per cent on iron girders, bridges of that description would generally cost less to tho shireä than bridges constructed of timber, and that, consequently, the duty íetards the development of the ountry districts, and is an impediment to farmcis brm¿ mg their produce to niaiket This experience in checking develop ment is repeated in a thousand in stances The farmer, for instance, should not forget the evidence how cheap hats ha\e been driven out of sale, and the conditions of 1 fe thus made harsher for him in this as in other respects Perhaps, however, what is most calculated to afiect the fannel s imagina- tion is the injustice practised in taxing and rendering deaior his toola of trade, and evidence on this point has been re centl) taken by the commissioners In our comments upon the testimony of the agncuituial implement makers, we must not be supposed to advocate any injustice to vested interests created by law The rights so established must bo respected, no doubt, but at least wo may inquire into the success of the ex périment of taxing tools of trade from the farmei s standpoint, and, if there is good reason for discontent, we may ui go that the experiment may be limited as far as possible in future, that no further growth of the duties bo per mitted, and that tho more obnoxious of the imposts be gradually lightened and íemoved J lie original contention was tint tho resu11, of taxing agricultural implements wou J be that the tools of trade would be ( leapened for the farmei But this plea would seem to be tacitly abandoned It is practically admitted-as we shall proceed to show-that the colonial implement maker raises his pnce3 to the full extent of the duty levied, but the agriculturist is now invited to regard his involuntary contribution to the local maker as an insurance payment to pre vent, first, monopoly, and then illegi tímate trading on the pirt of the im porter Mr JOHN BLNCLL says - 11 The importers may be depended upon " in doing that for themselves, but in " the absence of any local efforts to " supply the other colonists' daily re " quirement", many articles would cither " be scarce or not to be had at all, so " that under any circumstances the ltn " porters would be masters of the " situation, and charge what they liked " to ask for their goods " And he is followed by his compeers But it is a poor thing when resort has to be made to a bogy of this kind-to a scare fit rather for children than for men Wo should deny that the farmei would ever fail to patronise the local maker who can supply his local wants, but even if so, there is a number of articles which are still imported into this colony unchecked by local pro duction, without such results onsuing as the implement makers predict. Tea is a case in point So far aa wo are aware, not a pound of this aiticle is grown in Australia, and yet we hear of no wholesale robbery on the part of the traders It is not found necessary to levy a protective duty i e , such a duty as would lead to local production -m order to save the con sumer from perpetual conspiracies Bice is in very much the same position, so is timber, so is iron No doubt speculation is always possible, but experience and logicboth tell us that the best check upon undue speculation is freedom of intercourse The worst rings known to mercantde history aro those of America, whore manufacturers, having first secured the market by means of high duties, proceed next to combine for the purposes of plunder Specific testimony was given by Mi. M'LEAN as to the manner in which tho duties force up pnces hero Ploughs are 50 per cent dearer hero than in England, and a reduction of duties, Mr M'LEAN says, would bring down prices at once Passing over the testimony of the importers, however, we come to the evidence of the protected manu facturers Mr H LENNON, who was chosen to ropresent the trade, defends the duties because they keep out the manufactures of countries which "have a special advantage over " us, possessing facilities of cheap labour " with the raw materials, coal and iron, "at their door" And Mr LENNON insists that tho Victorian farmer shall not have the benefit of these " special "advantages," but shall forego them, and shall have his tools made under comparatively disadvantageous cucum stances The farmer's wheat must go to. the free trade country, but his tools must not como from there. Mr. BONCLE is in entire accord witliMr. LENNON His statement is, "At pro « sent the protective duty raises the " price of an inferior article to the same .' as that of the superior one which I » make " That is to say, he sells his goods at the same price as the English article is sold at, that price being, owing to tho duty, either 10 or 20 or 23 per cent above the natural free market level Mr BUNCLH adds, " Certain " lands of chaff cutters are not imported » now " This remark prompted Mr M'INTYKE to put the question, " Then " why cannot you do without the duty " on them if the English manufactuiers «. do not come into competition with "youl' And tho reply was, "The " purchaser would then got the imported " machine at 30s cheaper, and would " buy it in preference ' In other words, the price of all these cha'Luttors is now raised by 30s over their natural value The fat mer pajs this much more than to o need, and the state does not obtain 3 one penny in the way of revenue Mr JAMLS IlurciiiNS, of the firm of Messrs T Eoi ^so\ and Co ,letsf ill occasionally similar admissions Hie price of local threshing machines is, ho sajs, £270 each, " about tho same aa is charged " for imported machines, ' so that hero again there is an increase, and not a reduction, of pneo consequent upon tho taxes Mr HUTCHINS says that the Mossrb llvisSOMi sell threshing ma clunes in bond at £233 The farmers were told that the result of the duties would be that tho local maker would sellbelow the importer « price But in this instance puces arc rushed up to the extent of £35 e ich machine , and tina according to Mr HUICIII\S'I own showing It is to be noted that all tho firms whoso names we lu\e mentioned nore at w ork hei e 1 ¡ foi e protective duties were thou0ht of 1 hoy have ¿rown, just as agriculture his grown We must evj less our belief th it they as well as othei trades would have flourished equally v,eil without the duties aa they have with them, because just as the\ cripple the farmor now, so aro they crippled m turn by the other subsidised industiie" If all lud been free, all uould have progressed Uns raaj be a. matter of opinion, but dealing with the question from a farmer s standDOiut, it is a f ict that the a0ncultuiibt has not received the promised benefit Lils tools of trade have been rendered dearer and not cheaper lho local implement maker and the importer were competing twentj years ago, and they aie compet mg now, and the only difference, so far as the farmer is concerned, is, that ho has to pay 30s v. hero he need only pay £1 London fixes the price of his

In the Equity Court yesterday, before Mr nBttce Molesworth, evidence was taken in a Buit of Kennedy v, Jcllett. The plaintiff waa MIBS Emily Mary Kennedy, the daughter of one James Kennedy, a farmer, at Wahgun yab, who deeirea to have a decree that she ia entitled to claim a mortgage for £800 over land near Wahgunyah, which she allégea waa given to her to secure payment of a aam of £800 which ehe had lent to her father Her father bad Bince become insolvent, and the defendants who were trustees of his estate, denied that the; wero obliged to consent to the claim After the evidence had been con eluded, the case waa adjourned for a fort night In the ault of Bréese v Lindsay, the plaintiff sued the defendant to enforce per formance of an agreement by the defendant to Bell to him some honsea in Munster terrace, Hotham The plaintiff alleges that he purchased the property for £530 from Mr Barratt, auctioneer, as agent for the defen- dant The defendant denies that he had authorised Mr Barratt to sell the property. The evidence was not concluded when the Court adjourned till this morning The author of the story about Russian designs on Melbourne, Henry Bryant, alias "Count" Henri de Beaumont, was tried at the Kilmore General Sessione yesterday on a charge of obtaining goods by means of false pretences. On the 3rd ult, the prisoner pur- chased, at Kilmore, from Mr L Peri, a jew- ellery hawker, a watch, chain, and diamond ring for £13 10s., which he paid for partly by a cheque for £10 15s., purporting to be signed by D. Syme and Co., of the Age office. The prisoner represented himself as a partner of Mr. David Syme in a mining speculation at Reedy Creek, and on the faith of that representation the cheque was accepted. A second presentment against the prisoner was for having on the 3rd ult forged and uttered a cheque for £5 10s. to Mrs Berg, of Broad- ford. This cheque also purported to be signed by D. Syme and Co. The prisoner, who conducted his own defence, emphati- cally denied that he had represented himself as Mr, Syme's partner, or that he forged the cheques, although he admitted he had passed valueless cheques. He was found guilty on both charges, and sentenced by his Honour Judge Skinner to three years' imprisonment for the first charge and two years' on the second, the sentences to be cumulative. A nolle proseguí was entered by Mr. J. T T. Smith, the Crown prosecutor, in two other charges of forgery and uttering. A good deal of interest waa taken in the case, the court being densely crowded all the time the trial lasted. A scene occurred yesterday in the Court of General Sessions during the trial of Wil Iiam Wells, Joseph Keily, and Richard Wynne, who were charged with having in- flicted eerious bodily barm on Elizabeth Denny, at Collingwood, on the 20th May Mr Puives, who defended two of the pn Boners, was engaged in crosa examining the prosecutrix in relation to the nature of the injuries ehe bad received She protested against being compelled to describe her in- juries in open court, and one of the jury, whose Bympathy waa evidently aroused on bo half of the proBecutnx, exolaimed, " The jury protest againat the insolent way in which Mr, Punes is cross examining the witness Wo consider his conduct moBt unmanly " Mr. Turves said that it waa a moat unuBnol thing for him to be attacked from the jury box. He waa instructed that every word the proaeou trix had said was untrue He was eimply discharging hu duty to bis clients, and he would not be deterred by the remarks of ignorant jurymen. This observation elicited another indignant rejoinder from the jury, after which the matter waa allowed to drop.
