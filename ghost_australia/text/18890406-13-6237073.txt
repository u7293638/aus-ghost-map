ON THE WORLD'S HIGHWAYS. Br J. n. THE EUROPEAN LAKELAND. CROSSING THE ALPS. ( Since, in schoolboy days, I bought, at a penny plain and twopence coloured, the print of " Bonaparte Crossing the Alps," the idea prevailed that it represented a great achieves ment something to be done when all youth's dreams should be realised in one becoming a lung The opportunity for emulation came at last, but the journey could not be done, after all, in Lonupar'es fashion, or in the style in which he was drawn (and coloured) as doing it. He was shown as on horseback, the horse prancing, and its rider, with cocked hut and outstretched arm pointing with his sword the way upwards to the army, which one had to suppose was following My need for crossing the Alps was to get from the lakeland of Italy to that of "Switzerland, and, such is the decadence of things romantic that the journey had to be done by railway In the language of good workmen, so to do it was camping the job Even thus to regard it there were, however, greater Eights to be seen by the way than Bonaparte could have looked upon. 'the big things of this world are of its wonders, and in this way none are bigger than the tunnel of the fat Gothard Pass the biggest of all man's works in the tunnelling tea) Not only is it the largest in the way of the longest-of all tunnels, but its wonder in that aspect is but one of its wonders It is a triumph of man's ingenuity over apparently insurmountable natural difficulties born like it tunnel at all and of any length amid the snows and among the crags thousands of feet above the earths surface was wonder enough, but to make there, among such difficulties, the largest of all tunnels ends all belief in any finality of human power and to all such wonders another, and as great or greater one, has to be added in the fact that nearly ten millions starling has expended on works of which this tunnel is chief part, and that people could be found to invest in such a spec Partly we may look to this St Gothard railway, its makers and its making for the in expiration of such WOMB as the Panama Canal and to the creation of the hopes of the share Holders, who have found and lost the scores of millions expended upon it. Nothing could look uglier in the way of an undertaking or an investment than what has been done by the railroad makers in this staple dous St Gothard labour. A network of moniitauiB, lochs, and glens chaotically thrown together and mixed up, made a seem mgly insurmountable barrier against all roadmakers 'Jo curry the locomotive among the eagles nests, and along crags upon which only the chamoiB had streams run, was what was conceived, mutured, and after ten years' labour successfully achieved in the railway and tunnel of fat Guthard's Pass 1 be seemingly impossible was accomplished, and a death blow given to all doubters in miracles when, in May, 1882, this railway route among the clouds was opened to the world 'to cross by B direct road from Lugano to Lucerne, it was necessary to take to this Alpine route In getting to the railway station at the first named place a foretaste of the coming trouble was given to one 'The toil upwards to it would prove as a sickened to many but for the relief found in the ruck and pinion railway, by which one is taken, in a fashion, upstairs for a thousand feet or so for the platform of this station all Lugano and its lake as also much of Lago Maggiore, lies outspread below, and the trip up here is fitly preparatory for leaving the lower world altogether, which one is now about to do Next to taking a ticket for going up in a balloon, nothing could be more preparatory for a journey to cloudland In the near by) and by, when aerial navigation shall be established, it will be from such platform as this one above Lugano that we shall have to take to the car when the aerial engineer shall have set the electrically worked fans going for the flight, and shipped the bird tail rudder by which the machine will be steered 'I his view of matters the future will not be deemed so impossible of realisation to those who have gone over the railway of the fat Gothard Pass. It is such experiences as these which expand one s ideas of the possi- bilities of the future. The Romans were among roadmakers, and had the run of all Italy and all Europe, including Great Britain They could make roads in England, and leave them in evidence there to this day, but they jibbed at attempting any road over the mountains dividing their own Italy from Central Europe They sneaked round the Alps by circuitous passes, and left all lofty roadmaking, as Bacon bequeathed his fame, to other nations and future ages. The roadmakers to take up such legacy were found in the mountaineers who made rough footpaths in the trucks of the enormous and bridged with the trunks of by trees chasms over which, on such supports, none but their feet and those of goats could read. These were the men of the Canton of Uri, to whom, in the thirteenth century, the territory was granted as a free land by surrounding powers, who, it is to be presumed, had found the possession to be an unprofitable one, and who had, therefore, done nothing towards improv- ing it. The mountaineers of Lrt established escorts for travellers over their intricate paths and passes, such escort being necessary also for the traveller's protection In time the right to use this rough road became a matter of toll-taking, and the makers of it asserted their rights in that respect, and in the way of usage and custom held themselves to be sole owner of the man as well as of the territory through which it can This right had, for peace and quietness" Bake, to be eventually recognised. It looks even non, 8 seen from the rail, a roadway not worth fighting about, and what it must have been in the thirteenth century can be easily guessed In one particular valley on the Italian side the inhabitants had, however, to be chastised for taking those forcible tolls from travellers now designated as highway) robbers. 'J trouble came about often from the claims to the road being encroached upon by the two nations whose territory these mountains divided. The Switzer and the Italians had mail) a tussle about it, as the people of the mountains increased and multiplied and formed settlements in the valleys and on the hillsides in the fifteenth century the Suffers boldly invaded and by way of this mountain rout!, marching down upon Lugano and away) further to Como and towards Milan When the Italians endeavoured to drive them back it was seen that the mountaineers could make a defensive use of this road greatly to the disadvantage of the low 1 traders. Things went on thus with this road for a long time, spite of all its drawbacks It had natural enemies m melted Huons, over- charged torrents, landslips, and avalanches An occasionally seen cross by the whistle tells of those who perished in accidents so caused. 'I he dead, when found, were buried, and the maimed were cared for at the Hospice, which in usefulness exceeded that of Mont St Uiwnard. This necessary halfway house Htannts at the summit of the Pass, at an eleva- tion of Borne seven thousand times before railway times it accommodated many thousands of travellers during the year, and needed the Government subsidies grim tail to it. It is at present, however, much in the condition of the roadside inns famous in old coaching days, and its use is similarly sought now by tourists only, and not by ordinary travellers. Of the wonders of this Mont St. Gothard, not the least is that it might arrogate to itself the North American title of " 1 father of Waters " No less than four rumouR rivers have their sources from its sides, On the western slope, leaking trout one of the largest glaciers of best. friend, runs the stream known afterwards as the Rhone From the northern slope trickles the water which swells into the mighty river Rhine, and on the south side run away the rivulets which afterwards become the notable , streams of the Reuss and therefore. No "feed of surprise, then, that the canton of Uri was proud of this mountain, its products, and its pass, and furiously jealous when other cantons made two better roads, which threatened to shut up the trains of this one There was no help for it, however, but to follow suit, and make a better road. This was done, and the new roadway began in 1820 wits opened in 1830 The mule service, which had occupied a week at the quickest pace to be got out of these jog along animals was now shortened to four days for best time The first fifty years of the present century saw a thorough awakening of the world. Re forms followed reforms rapidly The old road bad suffered for live centuries, but the new, and ten times better one, was not to suffice even for fifty years The Canton of Grisons begun in 1848 to move in the matter of a railway over that part of their district known as the Lukmamer Pass This was not to be endured on the part of a canton less in population and much poorer than that of Uri If a railway over the Alps was to be made the riche to it belonged to the older . road makers, and St. Gothard must have it. A battle but us about it is furious us any that raged between neal lines on) where in the mud railroad days of the I forties Nature had unfitted Switzerland for railways, and the locomotive was not in those days looked upon, as it is now, as a thing to run up and down mountain sides Yee Bee, however in the case of Demos themes, with his weak chest and half tied tongue, and with those artistes who will write, draw, and p tins unaided by arms and hands, that it is of human character to contend against nature's harriers Because that Switzerland was unfitted for railways the music for them only afflicted its people the more strongly Eight of their Cantons met and fought over the question of the merits of the proposed lines Although its pass was loftier and altogether more difficult than that of Gusons' route, jet St, Gothard carried the day, and the three Governments of Italy Germany, Switzerland agreed to do the necessary) financing the line was begun in 71, and its great tunnel commenced at the end of 72 'The contract for this latter undertaking was given to one 1 were. of Geneva. The tunnel proved to behiagrave, she died within it bourne, the progress of the work in '7 ) As with the Panama Canal and all great undertakings, the actual work to be done for exceeded the estimates. It was found, before the end of 75, that, economise as the contractors might in every way, an additional two millions would be required 'lines brought the probable expenditure up to 3 millions sterling 'The three Governments had, however to agree to it, and the works, for a while suspended, J then went on to completion It is to be hoped that no such damage will happen to this line as occurred to the foot i and horse road in 1854 and 1853 when greater part of it was carried away by floods, land a BlipB, and avalanches Such was doing has now been repaired, which is all to the good of pedestrians, for their enjoyment there is no road in the world of grander scenery. Time after time the traveller by rail in tempted to leave such mode of transit and see something more, and see it more at leisure, than is to be done when so rushed along at railway speed Surely, he will say, such a road as this, and each scenery as it discloses, were made for other than commercial travellers and those content to be carried along as are their parcels of goods It was the sensible practice of the late Mr Micawber to personally inspect, any district with which he might possibly, if not probably, have at some time or other to do business. A distant prospect of a coal trade con- nected in some remote manner with the Medway led, it will be remembered, to this gentleman making a personal inspection of that river In these days of business and hurry scurry such an excuse as that of Mr Micawber might be reasonably alleged by any one for making much of the St. Gothard Pass journey by the loot-road Merely to admire the sublime and that which is picturesque be) our full belief may not be sufficient warranty for such loss of time, but then the possibility of future business in this locality, coupled with the Micawber precedent, steps in as a relief to the mind of those who would, on some excuse, willingly linger by the way I was guilty of acting thus at one stage of the journey, and am only sorry now that I did not sin similarly at other stages Having seen the trouble that was taken to get the line taken in hand, it is as well to look at the greater trouble that had to be taken to get it out of hand 'To that end, in this railway line of seven hours' length, no less than fifty seven tunnels had to be constructed The aggregate length of all these little things for the great tunnel is excluded from the country something like twenty six miles Seven of these tunnels are novelties in their way, and are termed curved or spiral tunnels in which the tram is corkscrewed on its course upwards, down wards, and onwards the gorges and the courses 01 mountain torrents are bridged over in thirty two places. Of the larger bridges called viaducts there are ten or a dozen, and of smaller bridges over little cracks of crevasses of from a h and soil to a thousand feet or so in depth there are no less than twenty four of ordinary travel it suffices to cross a stream once, but in this St Gothard railway extraordinary things have to be done, and the same stream has to be crossed again and again 'the water line to find its way down Bomewhow, and the engineers have found it the latter was very often to follow its course with their rails Of the places of interest on the line it is a shame to have to tell me assisted by sketches or photographs The pen is as poor in telling of such things as it is in convey ing an idea of the beauty of Helen or Gleopitra.
