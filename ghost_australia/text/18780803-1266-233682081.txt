RIVER LEVEN (From, our own Correspondent.) Frosty weather is again in the ascendant, having vanquished the wet that prevailed last week in considerable power. There is one lesson that may be learnt from the severity of the "season, and that is, -the same precautions must be taken to preserve perishable materials as are adopted in the old country and elsewhere. Potatoes have been frost-bitten this year when supposed to be securely housed. I have not met with a similar instance during 25 years of coast experience. Mr Frampton, sen., met with a disagreeable accident a few days ago. Whilst inspecting some post and rail timber on a wet and slippery morning he managed to slide off a log with sufficient force to fracture his left leg a little below the knee. Fortunately assistance was at hand to convey bim home, when he was attended by E B. E. Walker, Esq., who soon got the limb into a comfortable position. Sir Frainpton is progressing satisfactorily. Mr Bennett has completed his contract for building the new wharf. As far as I am able to judge the work has been done in a creditable manner. The increased shipping accommodation'will be a great convenience, as we often have five or Bix vessels in together. A rpal ghost has been seen at the Leven oscillating between the churchyard and the new chapel. Much bair has assumed the vertical in consequence, and in some cases the said hair has not recovered its normal position yet. I would just say a word to those whom it may concern, namely, that lead in conjunction with gunpowder is a very powerful solvent indeed, of mysteries of the supernatural type, and perhaps might demonstrate that there are more profitable employments than personating the dead. A wink is as good, etc., etc. July 30.
