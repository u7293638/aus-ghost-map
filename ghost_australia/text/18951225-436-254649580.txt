NURSERY HINTS! Among nursery bints given in a contemporary are the following:—Gas should never be used in the nursery—the best light is that of oil lamps. These should be hong well out of reach of tbe child, so that there is no danger of tbeir being upset, In the night nursery use candles and night lights If your nursery walls are hung with paintings or engravings be careful they are of good quality, for bad paintinga ruin a child's taste and make him take a diBlike to drawing. We alt know that first impressions are the most vivid and the most lasting. A child should never be allowed to be frightened, for it may lead to fits or the child miy grow up timid and wavering. Nurses should never tell kira a tale of gobiios or ghosts or the little fellow will wake in the nights, having dretmt he has seen a ghost or some ot j*ct that the silly nurse has been describing to him the day previously. Should a child have such dreams he muBt have some kind person in the room who will soothe him, fondle bim, and take bitn into her arms, and let him feel that he has someone to rest upon and to protect him. He should never be scolded for being frightened.
