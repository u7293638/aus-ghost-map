J; 1 was recently standing at the gangway of i well-known steamer, idly watchirigher unloading. Tlie mate in commaiid^oF the men was of the very roughest typfe. He -was exceedingly ignoble. Se was a-gigantic fello-w. - He .had no authority.dver the sailors, or deck-hands, as they Ere technically called; except the physical terror he inspired. He cursed God and the men. He roared and thundered. He seemeii 1 quite for a knock-down at any; moment-. I asked about him. and was toid of the shocking brutality that be had often exhibited, .-which had several times caused his arrest. When; ! inquired why 5a reputable company kept- such a man in their' employ, I was'told-?' that there wasno other force except brute force, which could get the work out of a gang of the kind that nowadays follo'v tlie water." If the sea or the rivers and lakes were tiieonivpiaees "where thiserrorprevails my papermightiperhaps.hetterhavebeensentto tlie Soman s fWa?(?, that dear old paper, which may Heaven bless; Tlie ideaas quite common, however.-in theminds of-a certain type of overseers set to watch workingmen; that force of control is in -p. savage manner , and haistt tone ; m a face that never smiles on the toilers, nor notices a blister with compassion. Howmany Eeem to ?thirik it really necessary to curse the bended back of the workman! All this is a slander on human nature. I 'appeal to tlie thousands of miners' wives and daughters wlio may read these lines, if the roughfeaturea lius'band and father has not a tender spot in his heart bv which your love leads him. and which the brutaf overseer can never reach. I appeal to gangs of giants who, aoout the lumberman's camp-: fire these winter nights, may read what I now write, if there is not an <Xxssioaa man who is kinp among them bv ius kindness more than 6y any Appointment of the" corporation which put him m charge of them. Here and there you. liavean&t; him, and worked under him. He nevec-called a man- even a,fook He was too true to be brutal, too noble to be disobeyed^1 too just to be suspected, too brave to ask you to face a danger from which he himself Shrunk. A man who could tell a good story occasionally without the loss, of digmty when the laugh came in; whom yon "have seen in tears at some poor fellow's cottage, when accident had made the children orphans. -Thisman'B voice -was pitched low, nut it was mightier than tlie rokr of the blasphemer. Ko man can govern others, whodoes not govern himself. Tliereis many a kingly man who does not need to strike a blow with the hand, because the bio w he strikes is in the eye's glance. A. good mans suipnse, contempt or indignation shines in his eyes, i: Of all men, there are none "who are so amenable to the sway of character in an officeras the men ofthetea. s The sailor is al^vaj-s a poet He is quick to 1^1, where iandimen. slowly reason. :> Beas a ; dreamer. He ie inuch alone, and busy wfidi roices m a A w p o the soul. He has heann^bymemory or by hope. He is, like the philokrohet -a great grown child.
