I sat- up in bed shuddering. Merciful powers. 1 it was up' dream I The long drawn wail of mortal agony still rang upon the air. It came from the, adjoin ing room— that of my cousin Torn. ?;A'cold;s.w.eat pouring out all over me, I blindly crept Into my dressing-room and struck a light. Yes, it was no dreani. - The deadly kriss, lying bare and bloodstained on the Uttle table con victed me. As I snatched it up again, to gaze aghast at- Its gory edge, the mufiied groan once more struck upon my ears. Still retaining the weapon in my grasp, I darted out into the corridor. I .'saw the flicker of half-a-dozen candles, as, roused by the outcries, the inmates of the house hurried, panic stricken, to the spot. With the ap pearance of the lights, Tom raised him self upon his elbow, stretched his arm towards me as if in denunciation, and then foil back— dead ! I have a dim vision of paled, awed faces around me, looking at. me half compassionately, half-loathingly ; I saw the fearful gash in Tom's breast, from whlch'the blood still trickled ; above all, like a soar in my memory, I recall- the red-tinged kriss around which my' fingers tightened convulsively. When the police came I gazed at them blankly, unable to realise the import of their queries. I replied to them, at hazard, incoherently— ' His life !' I murmured, dlsjointedly. ' I- was- in it dream. 'Somnambulism 1 I don't understand. A crime— who says It was a crime V The police inspector shook his head pityingly, and turned to speak-to young Radson. ' Yes, yes,' said the lieutenant, with evident reluctance. ' It sounds like a confession. He'll go quietly, I've no doubt. I'll accompany you, too.' So they led me, dazed and Impassive, away. In a vague kind of fashion I knew that I was being taken to prison, and I managed somewhat to rally my scattered faculties. 'There was no. use in concealing .the unconscious 'part I had played in this grim tragedy, and I unburdened my mind frankly. '' ' It's a terrible business,' said Radson; when I had finished. ' No, I don't blame you exactly. In that half-sleeping, half waking state, you were hardly respon sible for your actions. But it's a terrible — terrible business !' ? „? He ueed not have told me that, for when I was left alone the vivid recog nition of my guilt was more than I could bear. The many instances in which I was indebted to iny cousin came to Up braid me with the baseness of my in gratitude in ever countenancing an 111 wish towards him. And in what way would his death benefit me now ? I could never be rich with Ills': wealth, nor .possessed of his lands ; -Dorothy, too, would execrate my name, and hold my memory in deserved abhorence. Nothing remained for me but the ghastly farce of trial and conviction ; beyond loomed the gaunt, forbidding gallows. '. '-111- ??'?. ; / '-' .- ' ?? : ?

By the way, we were all at fault with regard to Tom and Mr. Can nan's daughter. I had a long talk with the old man, and, from what he said, I conjecture that Tom was endeavouring to smooth the path for you. Aware that her father would probably discounte nance any engagement between you and his child, because of your unsatisfac tory position financially, Tom— the mag nanimous fellow— even hinted at settling a substantial annuity upon you, on con dition that Mr. Cannau withdrew all obstacles. That expedient will now no longer be needed ; equally, of course, Miss Canuan knew nothing of these pending negotiations.' 'And she ?' I murmured. 'Have you seen or heard anything of her ?'
