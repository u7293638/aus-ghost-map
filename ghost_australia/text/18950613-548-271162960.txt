THE LAPSES’ COLUMN The Old Path. The same old path ! Lon" years have flown Since last I trod its way; I scarcely thought—such change I’ve known— To find its marks to day. But still its lovely course I trace, Unchanged, by fence and rill. Through meadow, wood, and briery place, And o'er the verdant hill. And in tho valley, for ahead, • The evening shadows hold The house to which my footsteps led In twilight hours of old. Who treads the path r—who dwells there now? I neither know nor care; I only know no tender brow And voice awn it mo there. And that to walk that quiet trail Would give mo such deep pain As all my soul could not avail To drive from me again. Ala?! I know not where thou art, Wlrifc time has done with thee— ’Xia hut the ghost of my young heart Which haunts this placo and me. But I would give my life’s best pride, Could this old path once more Bnt lead me, dearest, to thy side, And to the love oi yore! Join: 1J, Ji:\vktt,
