Ie was out in full view, hend nll toil up, and stood so etill for n anomeon that I doubted if he was alive. There was a light brceeo blowing toward us, and nas ooan as our aninalsl got the scent, it required the niorts of every ns.tivo to prevent them from breaking oway. rly guns were being cleaned and oiled, and my two whito companions were looking after tlicirlhoslr." No one had the Irnst idea that the lion meant mischief, and we woro pro. onntly duofounded to roe hint Fpllil? r 0neo0s t'.le clrnl; nl comno walking into camp. V o measured his leap, and found it to b tiw n:y eight feet. Ine made it without an effort. I was to thei right of him, nnd thoe rotro of tile oulml was hin ol jeetive point. The lion advanced at a walk, uttering no nound, and thie ehout, sForculnn, and owhcops of the men, backed by the bellowingl of thlo cattle, nod the nouots of the horseo, had no itfoat on him. WVo had a new milclh cow tied to lth wllhel of ono of tlIe waggona, and tlh lion advanced to within thirty feet of her, and then made a spring whn;h lauded hibl fairly upon her back. lho fell in a heani, and he seirocd her by tho neck, gave her two or three ahekoo which broke the grass rope around her head, and he then got his right shouhldonndor her, ohid started off. .Tho cow no,?ept h-tk-nlrs li'e hundred jounde, but ho carried her with perfoot cae, her hind feet dragging on thOe ground, At the creek hoe mas an jump of eleven feet, neconding a aloping bank without ahalt, and soon dicappeared in the broken ground with his prey. 11o was gone beforo we hald a gun ready. Indeed, we wereo lucy not to have lost half our animals. I was no greenhorn in the animal businece at this date, but this was the first time I had over witnesFceduch cheek in a lion. Iend I bwon told that lie had such courato and coolncen, I should have laughed the otatemont to As soon an order hod been rcstered the tlreeo o us mounted our hordon, and, pro. Ceded by lien or sin natives and their dogs, croesed tlhe creol and took up the trail. After going about hall a mile we discovered the lion Eitting besido thIe conr?o in a little hollow. 110 wS eittling up like a dog, hend turned towards ie, hut as soonl an ho uonw us divide he ran off with his tail down, evidently thoroughly alarmed, and suoh was hislpee l that we soon lost him. iWe could count on his returning to the body during Ihe night, nod the nativco wero throroforo oet to work to dig a pit nod conceal it. They regarded the lion as being as cunning nas ho was wise, and the pit was not dug near the body, but thirty feet away from it, and in the direotion in which it was believedho would drag the body.

So long ason I lay quiet ho would reason that I was dead. nld Rivo his attention to the nntiveo.

No animal wont near the coullon tmh I0trt or the rccond, but on.the third wo c.ptured ta flo half.growl mole, o;nd Lgot him calged without Irouble. Uuriouely enough, to had oft.rel the uil not violence, being overcome by the itllotton, and when we found hinm the two eccmcd to be on tlhe bhot of tcrme, About four months later, on the Orange 10i01r, I had n close call for sly life, with no, eria at hand to aid onn by dlstracting the attention of th lionll. 1 had only one wihitl man wlith l ero, and he was ill of fcvor. We had dug 0t pit on a path Ifcqtlcntcd by lioen cornitg down to drillk, but wera mIlulh annoyed by othlr aninale falling into it. On the liral night we caught two Ihycnan on thoe rconda panther ; on lthe third n wild hog. Thece would h ave b en 1ri::.a ihad we not been after lionls and lions alone. On the fourth night I uelatiord u coupl! of natives in a Ite nner the path to frighten d i all gamlo but liuns. They 0were huntere, and k, new the walk of t tlion Ioroo that ol any othlr beast.

Wlhrn filst dirc.verc1d, the lion ovtnos lhead, but he got the rccr,t of Itheo morn in te tree, and etoplptd hort to growl and trifl, while the liotces, whoi wat, perhaps, very thirsty, advanced slowly and wcnt down into tlhe pit. iho pit was two milho frot our entop, and wo heard nothing of the row whiO l took place When the IHon discovered the trick plnaed on his mnate. Ilo tore around for a !poll like mrd, and then lay down at the foot of the treo nd besieged the raeo. As soon nl it woe daylight I leftcnarp on horn!. baok to ride over and aca hnot luck. I tode straight for theo plac, and, whel within forty rods, called to Ithe on. They an. swercd at once, and though I could rot make out what they Eaid, I koow that they wero exclted over soonclhilg. 1 was riding nround a clump of treen on to Rn opolen epce, when m?y horro nttddettly started. Next instant 1 wao on the ground, and a lion standing over meo, and I could hear the horso tnarinto away through the scrub ,hke mad, The lion had pulled me down, nearly tarilng the back out of my coat, vest, and ohirl, but not drotingl blood withll hi clawo. As in tihe prIvioua 5co0, I wne not ft ightcned, becouse it had oecurrrd eo soid. dontly that 1 had not lime to lo se y nervoe. I was on the lb ft ailde, barehanded, anld the lilot stood for a tmoment with hi IIighlt paw on toy shoulder, loolhit, nater the hoite. 'J'The natives aow thll flelilg borse, knew very well what had happened to nle, and at once desoondoe the tree anrd nado for lcamp. I did not blesa them any, and porlnaps that very acti/n eaved my ille. I had tiae to collect noy thoughts in that einllol minute, and as I4l1d routed one lion by banking like 0 dol, I decidedl to follow the Fame plnt in Ibis ctnr, Biut, as I onid t ttio beginaning, lons ardo a unlike an men.
