Throughout the performance Mr. Buchanan was frequently applauded. In the course of one of the finest passages he was disturbed from. his propriety by a squalling child, an interruption which he presented with that readiness which invariably characterises his country- men, and which commanded the sympathies of his audience. We regret that time and space will not permit us to enter into a longer analysis of Mr. Buchanan's beautiful study a study which comprised so many excellent and startling novelties. We trust, however, our readers will attend and judge, for themselves.' - Mr. Warner, of course made a feature of the Ghost, and shared with Mr. Buchanan the honors of the evening. Polonius was well played by Mr. Milne, who gave the admirable rules and instructions which the old courtier gives to his son for his conduct in life, in excellent style. Min Glyndon's Ophelia was a chaste and lady-like performance.
