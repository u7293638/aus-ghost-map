A QILOST INCIDENT2. "Talking of ghlosts," said 'the man. in corduroy, "I had an experience once that nearly 'turned my hair grey. I arrived late at night 'in a little valley town out 1west, where the tonly hotel 'as one of 'those amateur ggimerack places with worsted mottoes on the walls and plants in the windows. T-he landlord himself lighted ome to my croom and saw that I was made -comfortable. I was dead tired and sleepy, and dropped off 'the moment my th'ead toul'hed the clean, lace-rbordered ,pillows. I was awakened some time towards morning from a sound sleep very sudtdenly by a strange grating noise, and by the dinm light I saw a man rise through the floor rof the room. At first I thought he had come to murder mne, but the longer 'I looked the more certain .I became that hoe was no mortal man. I lay shak ing until daylight, ,With' my head buried in the beddlothes." "And then?" "Then I saw my own clothes, neatly surmounted by any hat, disposed on the frame of a dumb waiter where I bad placed them when retiri'ng. The landlord had hauled them down, brushed them carefully, and sent them up again, Igiving me a fright t.hat nearly turned my brain."
