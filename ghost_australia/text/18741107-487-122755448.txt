COMBATIVE GHOSTS, It seems, says the' J'all Mall Gazette,' that » widow named Mrs. Green, living at Spring field, Kentucky, has for some time past been [watered by the attentions of a ghost, who, with singular bad taste, commenced this syutem j[ annoyance on'y three mouths after the death if her husband. It is, however, only fair on the gnout to say that he appears to' be really deeply smitten with Mrs. Green and to suffer uucli mental anguish, for, besides emitting singular mid disagreeable sounds all night,- he rumbles about the house all day, making a noise like that of a horse rolling on the floor or pawing violently on the carpet. He has several times appeared to the bereaved lady and her friends, aud appears to be a nicdium sizud ghoit, wearing slippers, aud half hidden iu a white iiniizy cloud. On the 30th of June, however, the conduct of this enamoured ghost led to a most mysterious and ' crowning de velopment '—namely, the ghost of Mr. Green, who, justly incensed at the attentions paid by his mother ghost to his widow, suddenly made his appearance -Mrs. Green was at the timo in the cellar, when she saw the lute Mr. Green, or, to speak more correctly, half of the deceased gentleman,' for only his lower limbs mid feet were visible (easily recognizable by the particular cut of his trousers)'; and a cold hand was laid on her shoulder. *rIn the name of goodness, Dick,' exclaimed' Mrs. Green, ' what do you want V Thuu addressed, Mr. Green's ghost became Very communicative, expressing his intention at once and decidedly to put a stop to the other ghost's proceedings. He also sent messages on business matters to his friends aud vanished, repeating the word 'friend' three times. Since then Mrs. Green has heard such frightful knockings aud groauiugs that there can be little doubt that Mr. Green's ghost is constantly punching the uther ghost's head.
