r^y4^«: ULSTER FOtE-LORE. TtCI QBKSSV BTC alTD T&B; SVIL ETS. Tub eollsctor of folk-lore in UUter finds many tupentllloas brought from Scotland by the settlers, as w*U at Itgeads and fancies peonllar to tha Iriah popnlalitm. The latter consist prlaelpallT of fairy t«l«s and ghost ?torle', mtay- of them very poellwl and gme*fal ; and tHs fonas* cblaBy of »npers*l tlona r*K»rdlng good and bad luok, and talcs of witchcraft, wh!eh are more weird than peoUcaL Baf*n the two rac*s have mingled Ia tbe eooras ot tfcrte eentarlss, *o their folk-lore has lost tonwlhlag of its dlatlnet ohiiracter iatles, though preferring them, in the main. Thus the Pr»»byt«rian will somatlmea tall of hU adventure with the fairies, and . the Bnman Oathollo will auore you that tha batter hu been tplrlted out of his ehura bf a ?? witch-wife.' Most old and mlddle-sgtd people of the cottier das* In UUter have strong idew on tha tubjtct ot luck. To enter a homo where charninjc is in progress without waibicg your hand*, taking the charm-»Uff la them, and ' giving the ehurn a brash,' is thought tbe aems of Ignorance ; and en leaving tha hoata it I* d* rlgusur that yon shoald say, ' Ood bleaa yoar churn, ao' gie you the good of yoar tnlik »n' batter.' If a neigh bour cocao* fa to borrow a eosl or turf, and negleets this formula, he lays hlmaelf open to the wont tuapidoas, and the people ot tha bout* will ba mre to throw a pinch ol ?alt Into the churn as soon at his baek is torasj. ? To receive alms without blessing both giver and gift is considered very wrong. The present writer was in her kitchen lately when-: a beggar was helped by the servants, and she was surprised to eeo the cook rnn after tho woman and bring her back. The cook explained the proceeding thus. 'She took wo'er meal on' praties, ma'am, an' aho didna bid Ood bless we'er bouse an' place. She'll ju;t bless the house an' place before I let hoc go.' A certain old pedlar, a kind of Eiio Ochittxee, welcomed alike in cabin aud farmhouse for his story-telling powers, was g*ven a'littte jugful ot 8«eft milk one day, with whiott he was leaving the house much pleated. Two children ran to tho door a« he croraed the room, and startled him eo that he let tho jug fall. Hi* joy was turned into lamentation, and ho angrily complained that the children had ' blinked' his milk. He thinks it lucky to meet a hone and cirl when he is tetliog out upon a journay. and will 'wait, leaning his piek ?gaioit a dlteb, for an hoarttctil oas appears in tight, fie earns all the tobsceo he smokes by enrlog elfihot animal*, and his skill is widely believed in. The Down and Antrim peasant* oa their way to fair or market will tarn baek if they meet a red-balred woman. The people ol Tyrone and Armagh think it qaite as un luoky if tho fir*i person th»y eneouater ehoald happen to be a barefooted woman. Otbtrt are uneaiy if anybody runs aerois Ibeir pith, or lakes a short eat ; and others ?gain ar* miserable if a neighboar shoald make any remark about Ihes&imal; they have parohaied, without prauing and wiabint, Ibe osner lock ol it. Old people aay that tbe proper thing to do on meeliog a floe horts or oow i» to lay your ha ad open it, saying, ' Dtu, bat thoa's the party bone or eow ! Q 3d gie joa luck wi' Ia soms eoonki** no well-minded ptrsoni will make any rsmatk whatever about acy neighbour in his or her pretece* without adding, ' Ood blets yon.'
