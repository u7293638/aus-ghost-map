THE FLEMINGTOff HOUNDS. TO THE EDITOE OF THE AUSTBALASIAX., Sir,-On Saturday last the above pack met at the kennels, but owing to some of oar members misinterpreting the telegram from Warrnambool, an impression was abroad that the whole pack would be away, and that consequently there would be no hunting. Nevertheless there was a good few at the meet-a dozen pinks or more, and from 40 to 50 horsemen. In due course we wended our way to Maid stone, and were soon at work. The line taken lay parallel to the Mount Alexander Tail way for about three miles, crossing the Mel ton-road, where we had to negotiate stone walls, with now and then a post and toiler. Wheeling to the left we crossed the line near the ninth gate, through which the majority of the field passed, and headed for a mile or two m the direction of Mount Derrimut; then, turning again to the left, we re-crossed the Melton road, and after a brilliant and fast run finished near the Rising Sun, within a mile of where we threw off. The country was very heavy, and tried severely the pluck of the riders and the cleverness and condition of the horses, as there was plenty of fencing throughout. There were several falls, but no one was hurt. The distance covered must have been at least 15 miles. About 20 went Btraight throughout. Yours, &c.;, SAM'S GHOST.
