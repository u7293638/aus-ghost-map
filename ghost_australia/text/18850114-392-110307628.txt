Bermagul. fFrom oio' Correspondent.J Mucn dissatisfaction is folt here at the state ol our water supply, which is mainly derived from a small lagoon, covered with vegetation and unfenced, and in wbic.li cattlo and horses may be seen wallowing at all times. It is disgusting to thiuk that wo have no ohoice but to use this water, still at the same time there is no doubt that we could vastly improve it by fencing in tho lagoon ; but. bb usual, what is "everybody's business is no body's business," so it is left undone. I am informed by one of our most influen tial and reliable citizens that the money derived from the issue of licenses for cutting timber on the Bermagui common, and from other sources, should be spent in tho improvement of the common, surely then there is enough iu hand to fence in tho lagoon. La6t summer the water was totally dried up, and people had to dig holes in the mud to reach it, and when obtained it was nearly undrinkable. In my last, week's article you made mo , spell propitious "propetiouB," and Muruna " Murruna": perhaps you had been recently reading the " Staudard," which is enough to turn one's brain sufficiently to make slips in one's orthography. Another cricket match, married v. single, is arrangod to take place here on tho 2GLh .instant. We arc much grieved to hear of the death of Mr. Thomas Appleby, junior, formerly a resident of this place. He was much liked and respected by all who knew him, and we tender our earnest sympathy to his sorrowing relations and friends. [As to tho errors in spelling, we hope our correspondent's wrath will beappeased when we tell him (hoping he will uot in form the Police) that two fresh graves have been dug behind the office: ono for the compositor who maltreated our cor respondent's msmscript; the other for the proof-reader who faied to detect the error'. The graves are ton feet in doptb, and wo guarantee the ghosts cannot rise. -Ed. B.G.I
