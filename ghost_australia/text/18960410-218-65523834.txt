For the relief of these people the Indian Govern ment has instituted relief works on which 130,000 men are employed. The discovery last year in Java by Eugdne Dubois of the craniumn, molar tooth and the thigh bone of a humanlike being in a bed of early pleistocene deposits has aroused the keenest cgntroversy and iiterest in scientific circles. Anatomists are divided in their opinions whether the 'cranium arid other ,remains belong to a man or an ape. 'TIo' iapp e'and interior capacity of the cranium show it to be halt way between the gorilla and the European. The teeth are larger than those of man, and the cusps are decidedly simian. These : bigger, teeth' 'imply a. bigger iand ; much heavier jaw than that of man, and it is therefore concluded that with its small cranium and largo jaws the fossil missing link must have had a snoutly appearance, and speech most have been much modified, the sibilants disappearing altogether. The thigh bone certainly belonged to some being which walked erect, so that if it is granted that these fossil remains belong to the same individual there can be little doubt that the existence in the early pleistocene of a being half way between the European and the anthropoid ape has been brought to light.
