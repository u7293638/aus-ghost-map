ST. GEORGE'S HALL. HAMLET. "Hamlet" was announced for representa- tion at St George's Hall last evening. The house was fairly attended, the gallery and pit seats being crowded. We have often seen "Hamlet " played by actors and by amateurs â€”but we do not think that we have ever seen it, as a whole, burlesqued so villainously. Not only did Mr. Bennee display an utter incapacity to conceive the character he attempted, but he was so imperfect in the text that he even omitted a whole line in the soliloquy beginning "Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I," which every schoolboy can repeat correctly. The first duty of one who pretends to be an actor is to learn his part and until Mr. Bennee can condescend to undertake that task we had rather not be troubled to criticise his efforts. To fail in repeating the language of the author is in any case an offence not to be pardonod in an actor without very grave excuse, but for a gentleman who assumes the position of a star to "gag" Hamlet is simply an imperti- nence. Miss Raynor took the part of Ophelia, and did not succeed in removing the un- favourable impression which her cold and lifeless declamatiom of Pauline left upon us on Saturday night. Mr. John Dunn was cast for Polonius, Mr. Gladstone played Horatio, Mr. Ireland the King, and Mr. Appleton Laertes. Mr. Ireland's performance of the King is familiar to Melbourne playgoers, but the unfortunate surroundings caused him to read the part with less vigour than is his wont. Miss Bryer made a respectable Queen. Mr. Gre- ville was entertaining as the First Gravedigger, and Miss Forde looked very pretty as the page Osric. Mr. Warde may be congratulated upon his Ghost, as being the only part which can be pronounced thoroughly satisfactory. The tragedy was productive of much merri- ment, and the audience testified their approval of the efforts of the porformers by frequent applause.
