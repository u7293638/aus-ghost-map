LEAVES FROM MY NOTEBOOK. By 0. M. S. A DRIVE OUT THE APPIAN WAY. A pleasant party and a fine afternoon contributed to the enjoyment of what proved to be one of the most delightful excursions made during our sojourn in the. Roman capital A drive of a few minutes brought us to the boundary line that separates the City of the stars from the City of the Popes the living from the dead A plunge from broad daylight into the most profound dark ness could scarcely have been a more sudden transition than the passage from the noisy), bustling activities of city life to this deep solemn silence and utter desolation A moment ago we were driving hurriedly) along the guy promenades of the Corso, where Home holds her eainiMtl-now we are moving slowly amid the dim shadows of the silent past to our life is the palace of the Caesars an undue tinguishable mass of shapeless!, ruins, timid whose vaulted chambers and bro! en melts the oil now boots deeming it in night Jin poet of our party exclaims impassively nsw survey the scene Hello! 1 the uni end n Court Its time the uiiOilv 2 Rs and that there is a responsive echo from the romantic seasoning as the "trade calls, bet, who ( homes in sy mpatheheallj - ' Theielsuiov ct And in iu. in the mined battlement Y or which the pi ice of the Present hour Must viel I its 1 out and wait till ages are its do yer As if in mockery of the conqueror of the ancient Britons an English villa now occur pies the crest of the Palatine, whilst all around capital and column, portico and colonnade, he heaped together in confused masses from the base to the summit of the mount, clothe 1 in n) and crowned with laurel melancholy monuments of the mournful nine-inch) Driving near the site of the Circus Maxi must we are soon rattling along the antique pavement of Alie Appian MtiJ, which has been aptly styled the i egina naming Coal menaced by Appius Claudius A U C 142, it on finally extended from Home to Capua, and subsequently to Brundisiuni At present it his on!) been excavated its funds Village The ancient pin am not consisting of hex agonal blocks of stock and basaltic line though went into deep ruts, like those of temper, by the wheels of multitudinous vehicles-is still in it good state of present tion the greater part of the distance On either side it is still ed with lateral cause ways for foot passengers and at status in tennis with circular stone seats for west) pedestrians the cost of this queen of roads must have been enormous for not only were the engineering difficulties to be overcome of a formidable character, but its construction is as solid as tin tipHnstuig hills Of this twenty centum, are silent w ten cases But what a change these twenty centres have wrought !

Situated on the eastern slope of the Argentine, they occupy an area of more than a mile in circumference. As a rule it is scarcely less imposing Hum the Coliseum. "Wandering amid its interminable labyrinths, now pausing to examine the rare mosaic pavements, now taking a survey of its long array of massive wreaths from the summit of some stately inch and then calling to mind the luxuriousness of a Honran built, with its thermal mid struggles, its pomades and perfumes, you. form a concep- tion of Roman splendour and luxury which noothorruirr, perhaps, is calculated to produce. Historians relate that these baths contained 1,000 marble seats for the convenience of bathers. To adorn them the obelisk that now stands in the piazza of St. Peter's was transported from Egypt, while some of the finest statues, mosaics, and gems of the Italian museums were found timid its ruins. About three miles from the ancient Porta Ciipenu, on the Appian Way, is the chapel of St. Sebastian, famous for its numerous relics, and as the entrance, to the celebrated cata- combs of St. Callistus. These we did not fail to visit. Having been introduced by a Trappist monk into a dimly lighted hall, a ghostly Padre presented each of us with a was taper of saintly aspect, and then proceeded quietly to conduct us into the mazes of this subterranean necropolis. Never did Theseus stand more in need of the clew of Ariadne than we of the services of our goodly guide the catacombs consist of what appears to be an interminable series of w Hiding galleries and mcgann chambers, in some instances spacious and united, on either side of which mc the inches for the deal, with here and there a small chapel or oratorio In the dim light of your flickering temper you may see the ruin of a fresco of mural painting, 01 possibly decipher some of the inscriptions, which consist, for the most part, of a cross, the monogram of Christ, of the letters D M -Deo Maximo Despite ullin) philosophy) I found myself peering furtively) over my) shoulder into the darkness and mystery, half hoping, half fearing to catch a glimpse of the "Sptctn of tin Cutta combs -tin old pagan phantom that, according to a dun tradition, has been wandering in this labyrinth of sepulchral gloom for more than fifteen centuries In alluding to the ancient legend, the ghostly guide informs you that this man demon originally penetrated into the catacombs in order to seek out and betray the blessed saints, and that he now seeks to entice and abduct new victims from the upper world to share his misery in tins subterranean baby until at death 'duties and ministers of grace defenders exclaims the signorina and there was an m audible ' Amen from the test of the party But we hither man of demon, "ghost or goblin, we saw it not Hw iib formerly supposed that the catacombs were ancient stone quill nts but more recent researches prove that they have been excavated for the most part, for the put posts etc in istian bunal Steele alludes to them in isolation for Milo us in Induit place or thing is and there can be but little stone t that subsequently the call) (transmits resorted thither during times of persecution not only for the purpose of merriment but also for divine worship in striking contrast to the catacombs, stands the state Ij mausoleum of Uculiu Metella lins celebrated monument in the form of a massive circular tower is a pt win t lient'andmatl on the AppiunM it Though it has withstood the rates of the barbarities and the plundering of popes the site and sack of the eternal city for nearly twenty centuries, it still bids fair to command the I admiration of twenty) centuries yet to come
