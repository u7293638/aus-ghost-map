Through the forest ways where tho things graze, the dappled, the fawn, the gray ; Wheru the tall ' Kameol' it sunset steal like ghosts to tho silent vley, Where the lions drink at tho reedy brink of tho slowly shallowing pun, Tho dissolbnoin shows out the doom that has given the earth to man. Slow and alow tho wagons go by thickot and thorn and pool, But their thin path traced on the homeless wasto is the road of ihe coming rule ; And in dread of I hat track the wild slinks back, and thu thief and the beast give place To the farm and field and the yearly yield of men of the wisorrace.
