Another beautiful day was favorable for the continuation of tbe match between Stoddart's English Eleven and the Victorias team, but the last test match seems to have closed public interest in the game for season, and thc attendance was no betteT than on the opening day, tbe takings being only £68 8s 6d. For the greater part of tbe afternoon, however, those present were cheered by the proBpect of an easy victory for the Victorian eleven, though towards the clOBe of thc dav this agreeable con tincrencv liPramn rnthpr n,nr» rAmnt» On thc previous day tbc Englishmen had all been disposed of for 131* and the Vic torians had made 100 for the loss of five wickets. Tbe not-out men, C. M'Leod (19) and Perryman (5), to-day made an excellent stand, adding upwards of 60 to the total before being separated, but the remainder of the team batted disappointingly, and the innings closed for 260. The Englishmen, being in a minority of 138, commenced their second innings very unfortunately, Ward playing the ball on to hi6 wicket before scoring. Brown and Brockwell made an effective partnership, putting on 65 Tuns whilst together, both batting steadily. A collapse then set in, and tbe three next wickets fell for a total of 33, a one innings' victory for the Vic torians beiog a possibility. Thc wickcts bad fallen thus — One for 1, two for 52* three for 78, four for 79, five for 02, and six for 148. .Ford, however, now came to Lhc rcscue, and despite the constant changes of bowling, which were all to no purpose, played a ster ling innings for 60, and was well supported by Briggs, who played on thc defensive whilst Ford did tbc hiiting. Thc pair remained at tbe wickets till the stumps were drawn having brought tbe total to 188 for thc loss of 6ix wickets. Ford's contribution was invaluable to his 6idc, and was about the best innings be has played in Australia. Nothing in the match, however, excited quite 60 much enthusiasm as JohnB' wicket keeping, as he never missed the ghost of a chance. There will be no play on Saturday owing to the complimentary race meeting to Lord Hopetoun, but it will be resumed on Mon day. The following are thc scores : — Victoria. First Innings. H.
