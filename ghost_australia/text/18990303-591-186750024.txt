From the pleasure grounds immediately surrounding the house sloped away the shrubberies, once shamefully neglected, but nowthatDuncanhadcomeonthescene, extra gardeners were employed to keep ihera in perfect order. The tennis-courts, flower-beds and hot-houses were Mrs. Grey's especial delight, and visitors to *' L'ir.ibroil" who knew them in their former days of neglect were loud in their V™' F-r 1 *"*miles <>f ,hsm aro„, n<nv Kl " woods, stocked with j came, nave splen did shootimr, and Dun- j can, who f was v an e ardent upholder of this '• <?«' was an ardent «ph->lder of Jlus , class of sport, revelled in the delights of tramping thn.ugh turnip fields after the part tidies, or standing at a hot corner bringi:.-j; "rocketers" to eavth. In the beginning of October the Greys had taken up their residence, where Maicolm bad followed them shortly after- wards. The ronp-de-grace which Lottie t fondly imagined she had given Muriel in w regard to her love for Malcolm had a sign ally failed. o Immediately on receipt of Muriel's note he had hurried to Havre and explained matters, telling her that Lottie's story , was a vile calumny merely to extort ! money. In her innocence and love for Maicolm, she was ready to believe it, and took hiui for none other than a devoted and much*to-be-pitied man. How to conciliate, or rather get rid of Lottie, was a task which proved no easy one for Malcolm on hearing that she had firmly declined to leave. His temptations of large sums of money were merely ridiculed by her. " As if I am to be bought out and cast^ adrift by your bribery. No, won cher, you will live to repent your work and will see some day that» woman can strike, and hard too." This was the last time he had ever listened to her. His temper rose to an ungovernable height, whence, hurling at her all the epithets his tongue could find, ho gave her a cheque sufficient to cover immediate wants and left her for ever. As she slowly raised the paper lying before her, she smiled that smile of j triumph which so often was seen on her j lips. . j " As if he can escape me," she said to i herself. " I will let him marry ; Oh , yes! we women do not spoil sport, and , then my turn comes." I Lottie soon after returned to Paris, where she had taken apartments for the j winter. She made no secret of her j whereabouts, though she did not care to j be so much en evidence since her desertion f by Malcolm. When she 8aw, one day, that the marriage was to take place early in November, a slight flush tinged her j cheeks as she laid aside the paper. | Silence was her only chance no wof making j her successful in the end, and this she ! knew well how to preserve. _ Like a snake in the grass she lay hid, i awaiting her opportunity to dart. ! Malcolm's davs were one Ions dream of j • bliss. He loved Muriel with all his soul, j 1 and was her slave entirely, granting j everything that was in his power, to make her life if anything still happier. 1 How often I recall the day of that j horrid woman's visit," she said to Malcolm ; as thev wandered through the gardens one ; morning. "My love, why trouble yourself about ' these silly ideas when all is over ? True, ' it was a fiendish story to invent, but where is the man who is safe from the tongues of slanderers? That woman is one of the most notorious of her kind in London or Paris, and has many times before practised the same game."' Oh, Malcolm darling, I am so thankful to think that she left me when she did. The i iuc remembrance iriuciuumnwof that 1 ~ revolver bein — P oi » tcd at wU1 never fade from sometimes awake with a -start and imagine she is looking down at me with those cruel eyes. How they shone ! I shall never forget them." " My poor Muriel, it was indeed a terrible ordeal to go through. Do you know, too, that the woman was actually i in the gardens watching us that morning 1 Yes, that was how she found out, j I and than directly my back was turned she seized the opportunity of telling her lies, and thought to obtain money from 1 you." } "As it was," said Muriel, "she took those lovely sapphires you gave me." No matter, better she should have those than have injured a hair of your bead; besides, what are bushels of sapphires beside my sweet Muriel." Herp lie bent down and softly touched her forehead with his lips. " Ah ! will this great happiness always go on, go on for ever ? Dearest Malcolm, t wish fop no other heaven than this. For you always to be with ipei and when death takes one, for the other to be taken too." ' Come, Muriel darling, do not grow sad over our love, remember we have y, our duties in life to perform though we are tq bp ipan and wife. We cannot quite shut ourselves up froip the world, °F what would it say of us suppose ft would call us selfish," .aid Mu U S S "burirveiTkVe"\eTfish at firsts afld it sperus only natural." The pheasant shooting had now begun iq pes} earnest, each morning tt party of beaters were senj; before {lip guijs tp search the woods for game. Malcolm was a good shot, and for this reason was I • , ' ; • j i { [ always given a busy corner in the drive, where, as the bronze-winged birds sailed above his head with a loud whir-r-r-r, he seldogf {ailed in bringing them to his feet-' * "" " Muriel would often accompany the' shooters in thick boots and short gown, when her match through turnip fields or ; even dirough ploughed ones would prove' h^r Jto be as energetic as the rest. ff ltike shpoting for its surroundings '-^.^Ji^iiaify'l^r.'lliA pake <qf tflliog,* she said, m they sat at luncheon one day.

( " But tliat wasn't your" caoe, Muriel,' said her father, "you had a liur.dred people who were ready to make life pleasant for you, and one, I aui thankful t< say, has succeeded." Duncan here raised his glass with s know : ug wink at Malcolm. "Oh! I am not talking about myself; you are so persounl, papa." She blushed a little and looked ft way. Those were happy days in the Eastern County as Muriel wandered through the golden-colored woods, which would soon be hard and chill with the frosts and enows cf winter. Scarce a month remained fpuu the time when she would Malcolms wife thomrh «o snort a spnee, an unuiuueu ^ougm « ou.o steal inti mto her heart hear, as ,he lay awake in ^ ^ ^ hours ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ voni}t. f. t,lu r}ns ^ t ^ , ; ^ anything would comc to ci Seck d.e.r : umt> n. j Muri.'l had belioved every word of ; Eric's letter whieh had been receive.!

" I knew notions at the time. I was a mere child. I ivver kne^v wiiat real love „ w^ imul 1 uu-t Malcolm. She could not feel ful for what Mrs. Fordyce had done, a d yet, within herself, there was a secrei j.-img of selfh,:d removed congratulation in having from her path tlsat one person wlio debarred her from marrying Malcolm. What Eric's thoughts were on the matter she hardly liked to think about. She knew what a large and unselliah heart he had, and how dreadful a blow her marriage with another would cause him. " But I do not love him, and life would never be happy for him. or for me either. I cannot write to tell him I am engaged. But he will know that soon enough. It is, indeed, a hard tiling to he situated as I am, and no one can advise me." These were some of the thoughts fiat would keep l;er for hours tos>ing on her pillows. Slie thought thr.t when once the marriage was or, r nothing emil.l matter then. Kric in;gl;t coino to England if he liked, but all talk about her previous love for him would be a mere waste of time. Mutiel srill felt that there was one thorn in her bed of roses which niiirht at auy time make its presence felt—that thorn was Eric. Oftentimes Muriel would complain to Malcolm about leaving her, perhaps on wet days, to sit over the f:re whilst the shooters were after the partridges. " It's all very well for you men goins off early in the morninv; uud leaving us women at home. But you have no idea how bored we get with one another's society."' Mrs. Grey had asked several young ladies with their mothers to make up the j number at dinner of an evening, but Muriel, beyond making herself just ordinarily agreeable, never cared to be Ions: in thfir company. Tn fact, when Malcolm was away from lier the world appeared as a blank. " Well, let us drive to day, Muriel,"'he said one morning, (indin- her in a discontented frame of mind, and accordingly it was agreed upon. \ erv niai'v times afterwards he wou.d order the plncton with its tliorou^iibred chestnuts, which spanked alon«_; the quiet higaways with n>> more :tua;;;'it <if tlie weight of the carri;;i, r e beh'.nd tliem than h::d ir been a eiiild's. " I'll keep 110 rubhi-h in my stables," Duncan would say, on showing ilis equine coHec'ion to a friend, which was very true. \- And his horses, whether for pnd.lle or harness, were perfect ..-f tiieir kind, :ui = I Duncan . loved them as if th.y were own children. 3Iy cunseiein-e, how they're pulling.

"Have we much business in tho bnstling city to-day?" exclaimed Mileohn, satirising the place which loomed ahead. Dullington bore out its name to tlie letter. Its grass- growu streets, wide and long enough for armies to be 111 relied through them without breaking line, wore I the same appearance every day of tiie j week, except Saturday, on which day market was held. Its shops had tlie same things iu the windows month after mouth, despite the rapid changes of fashion, which, in thi> nineteenth century we are so accustomed to. '"Well, of a'! •';•* holes! 1 ' exclaimed Malcolm, d'awii , . his horses, with a scrooping noia • t the curb, this is about the dullest that I've ever been in." You have alwaj-s some disparaging remark to make about places or people." said Muriel, preparing to alight. ** Ii's tlie same everywhere except iu your beloved London. Now there is plenty of historical association, even in this hole as you call it," Whilst 1 am choosing a carpet suppose Museum which Queen Elizabeth is said to have used on a visit here." " Hang Elizabeth, what do I care about the woman or the tea- service." Malcolm almost bawled this last remark out, so that several of the passers-by looked up. The sight of the trap, horses, and occupants, was a general object of admiration as it bowled along through the quiet streets, making them echo again yifeh its planning pole-chains »iid clattep of hoofs. " " How nice we look in the shop windows," said Muriel. "Well, don't be all day admiring your self.
