A SPECTRE HAND- The ghosts which are Eaid to frequent tbe precincts of Hampton Court Pabce are more or less known by reputation, but their rambliogd have been promiscuous and uncertain. Qreat interest in their movements has, however, been newly aroused by tbe strange experieuce undergone by an artist who, during the past week, has been visiting certain rooms of the palace for the purpose of sketching tbe old Flemish tapestry on tbe walls. Whilst engaged in -the Guard Watching Chamber in broad daylight—for the room is closed' to the public at 6 o'clock—this gentleman, Mr Haynes, of Surbiton, positively asserts that a spectre hand, white and delicate and ricbly jewelled, has persistently intruded between bim and the tapestry. At^fkdt be imagined tbe disturbbg element must be one of the many hands so beautifully inscribed on the tapestry, but tbe limb, be says, moved slowly from one stage to another, and pointed,downwards. Mr Haynes was much agitated, and told several fricuds of this curious visitation. They, not unnaturally perhaps, advised bim to dismiss tbe subject from bis mind and return to the chamber and bis work. But the hand reappeared before his startled cye9; and on tbe last appearance of the phantom the artist made a hurried sketch of the outstretched hand, the rough outline of- which depicts a brilliant marquise ring on tbe forefinger. Tbe effect of these continued visits of tbe supernatural on Mr Haynes is very visible ; he is unnerved, and he has suspended his sketching. These are the plain facts, but there is, it would seem, a weird and historic connection between this hand and tbe hand of the Queen Catherine Howard, one of the wives of King Henry VIII.
