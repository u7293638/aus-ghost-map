TBHE CHURCHES. At several of the local churches special services were held and special collections made. In connection with others, the time fixed was not convenient, and so their "Hospital Sunday" is to be observed on some more opportune occasionl. There were good congre gations at both the services at the central Congregational Church. The pastor (the Rev. Joseph Walker) occupied the pulpit, and preached on the subject of "Jesnu doing good," his text being "How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him" (Acts z., 38). Doing good, he said, was a phrase with a very wide meaning, and healing was only a phase of doing good. The great parlt of the earthly life of Jesus was spent in healing all manner of diseases. Attention was then drawn to how this part of the Saviour's earthly ministry was reproduced in our modern hospitals. Jesus lived the life of a poor man, and spent his life in going about doing good; His work was in perfect harmony with the will of God. Jesus Christ's deep personal sympathy with those whom He wished to benefit was alluded to, and the congregation were exhorted to live under the law of the will of God and to strive to catch the Saviour's spirit. Mr. Walker's subject at night was tle " Feeding of the Thousands," based on John vi., 12 and 13. The collections for the day amounted to over £31, of which £17 goes to the Hospital. At the North Ipswich Congregational Church appropriate sermons were preached--in the morning by the Rev. W. V. Young and at night by Mr. G. H. Shillito. The surplus collections are to be transmitted to the Hospital authorities. The rector of St. Paul's Anglican Church (the Rev. Canon Bartlett) delivered impressive sermons bearing on the subject of "Charity," and half the offertory, which was of & eatiis factory nature, will go to the funds of the Hospital.
