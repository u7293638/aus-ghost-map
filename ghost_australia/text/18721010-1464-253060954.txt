WILL O' THE WISP. OR, THE CHARTERS TOWERS RUSH. (vide cartoon.) Floundering on through the thick of the mire, Foolishly chasing the ghost of a fire, Headlong to ruin they scrambled and rolled, Stumbling on Famine while seeking for gold ! Deaf to all warnings from Public and Press. Rushed they right into the grip of Distress. This is their story — a pitiful one ; Too mournful for satire : too painful for fun. Readers take warning ! That destitute crew Our artist has drawn to present to your view, Stupider far than mere children who lisp, Sacrificed homes for a " will o' the wisp ! " Obstinate-headed, and, eke, to the last Blind to the records which shadow the past — Records of " rushes " whose issue all know Was ghostly Starvation — the worst of all woe.
