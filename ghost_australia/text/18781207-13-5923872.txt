SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1878. The speech read by His Excellency the Governor at the prorogation of Parliament was not more remarkable for strict accuracy of statement than such deliverances usually are. His Excellency is made to acknowledge the " patient assiduity and attention to " the labours of legislation which have been exhibited by hon. members. As close observers of what has taken place during the session just brought to a close, we must confess that we have failed to perceive that unwearied industry and close application to affairs with which hon. members are credited. The Legislative Council has certainly given patient heed to the various matters brought under its notice, but the Assembly, in our opinion, has been more addicted to the multiplica- tion of words without wisdom than to the transaction of practical business. Important measures, we are told, have been passed, which " will add to the " general prosperity of the country and we are furthermore assured that, " under the blessing of Divine Pro " vidence, the producing and manu " facturing interests of this country " continue prosperous, notwithstanding " the prolonged commercial depression " which has prevailed here as well as in " Europe, in America, and in the neigh " homing colonies of Australia." In passing, we may remark that we think it is a pity to drag in " Divine Provi " dence " in this way, to give a sort of sanctimonious flavour to very doubtful statements. The Divine blessing no doubt attends all honest endeavours, and sooner or later crowns all righteous toil with an abundant return. But the action of this country in its corporate capacity during the last year has been neither honest nor righteous, and even if it were true that the community is prospering, it would be the merest after tation to connect its welfare with the favour of Heaven. What the measures are which will add to the general prosperity of the country we must confess our inability to understand. In fact, before even guessing at those which the Premier had in his mind when penning this sentence, we may fairly ask, where is the general prosperity that is to be added to It is a matter of common notoriety that never was everything connected with the material well-being of the people at large in such a state of almost hopeless prostration as at the present moment. Mercantile business is for the nonce practically dead. So far from " the producing and manufacturing interests being in a flourishing condition, they are suffering severely from distrust, and consequent stagnation brought about by the revolutionary proceedings of the Government. Property is quite unsaleable, except at startling reduc- tions, and credit, in connexion with enterprise, is almost destroyed. The present condition of things is bad enough, but the future prospect is far worse. The existing state of suspense and uncertainty must continue for at least nine months and when affairs are in the condition we see them now, they have a fatal tendency to go from bad to worse And it must be remembered that so long as the Berry Government remains in office, we can see no end to our downward progress. If the embassy should be successful-of which there is not the slightest prospect we should lose all those securities for property, without which a revival is impossible ; while, if it should fail,, we are promised revolution and civil war. To talk about " adding" to our " prosperity" at the present juncture is surely the very perfection of contemptuous irony. ". so far as we know, the only measure passed during the last session which by a stretch of fancy could be thought likely to give the country temporary relief from the financial and commercial evils with which the present Government has afflicted it, is that authorising a loan of «£5,000,000, No doubt this sum, if it could be procured, would give a temporary fillip to many in arrests which are at present languishing, but certainly it would not " add to the " general prosperity" for long, unless we made a radical change in our method of procedure But granting, for the sake of argument, that this solitary measure is a beneficial one, Ministers cannot fairly congratulate the country on it, for since it has become law, they have been doing their best to render it useless The Parliament of Victoria may pass as many loan bills as it pleases, but then utility must depend on the w Willingness of English capitalists to lend us money This most assuredly they will not do so long as Iii. Ev clliiJiCy's advisers think proper to go "stumping" the country, big thing out threatenings and slaughter, menacing popular, talking hightly of revolutions, doing their best to intensify class antipathies and proclaiming, as distinctly as words can indicate intention, a delusion tion to sacrifice any thing and everything to the retention of office He paid graphs in the speech about the prosperity of the country an average specimens of libel d" mendacity, and are just what we might have expected to find in a Ministerial composition We think, however, it would have been well if His E. claim,., the mouthpiece of the Queen, had declined to give them currency The news from England with respect to Asiatic and his is somewhat unsatisfactory, but later events have been of such a nature as to dispel some of the anxieties which clouded the public mind at home two months ago, and the de- case of a victory which has been just gained at Peiwai, hythe divisionundei General KouutT"., is calculated to strengthen the hands of the Imperial Government, and to cool down the ardour with which Russia has been espousing the cause of Afghanistan It may also cause some modification in the tone of those journals, which, in the prosecution of purely party arms, have been un- patriotically aiding and abetting the tortuous and unscrupulous foreign policy of a power which combines Asiatic craft, duplicity, and mendacity, with an outward pretence of that candour, fair dealing, and sincerity, which are supposed to be the characteristics of the more civilised rulers. and statesmen of Western Europe According to the Daily News, the present Viceroy of India was sent out there two years ago with express in structions to provoke a rupture with Shere Ali "Why Lord Iattoin omitted to do so when Russia had her hands full in Turkey, and while Plevna was holding out so gallantly against the enemy, and why that nobleman should have waited until the arrival of a particularly inopportune period for the fulfilment of his orders, is not ex plained Possibly the inventive genius of the Daily News may suggest that, like Suleiman Pasha, he was bought over with that gold which Russia refuses to pay to her troops, but Reserves for the purchase of her enemies, finding that it is easier to buy them than to fight them It seems that on the very day the Treaty of Berlin was signed, a telegram was sent from St. Petersburg to Tashkent, directing the despatch of an embassy to Cabul, with the express object of exciting a breach between Afghanistan and England A late telegram advises us that the Russian Chancellor has denied that any such a mission had been formally accredited to the Ameer, and has also asserted that it was a mere act of courtesy on the part of General Kearney, who occupies a position of supreme command in Central Asia Precisely the same diplomatic equivocations and pi evaluations were resorted to when the Sultan of Turkey complained that General TciirrAAiEn, one of the Czar's most trusty servants, was organising an army in Servia, to which some thousands of Russian soldiers hastened, these happening, singularly enough, to have received so long a furlough as to enable them to take up again under 1 foreign potentate, against a power which was then on friendly terms with Russia The Imperial Chancery repudiated General loiiuiNUEir at that time, as a matter of course, and it explained the conduct of the deserters from its own army by refering to the warmth and strength of then Slavonic sympathies They were not obey ing the orders of the War Office at St Petersburg nothing of the kind They were men who had voluntarily set forth to assist in the emancipation of oppressed nationalities from the yoke of the once terrible Mahoum. But directly Servia, in spite of her Russian contingent, was doubled up by Turkey, General TciiEitivAiLirs master interposed, and peremptorily refused the victor permission to take advantage of his triumph on the field of battle Equally disingenuous is the conduct of Russia with regard to the embassy to Cabul , for it appears that this unofficial and unaccredited " act of " courtesy " comprehends the presentation to the Ameer of several batteries of steel field pieces, together with rifles and arms of the newest design, while it is also reported that the Ameer has 60,000 breech leaders in his possession, which are certainly not of local manufacture So demonstratively affectionate, indeed, has been General Kauffman in this spontaneous manifestation of his respect to Shere Ali, that the St Petersburg Gazette represents the latter as having written a letter to the general, in which he declared, "Our 'hope is in you, and in you alone " Meanwhile one of our latest telegrams states that the Czar has been making a speech at Moscow, the seat and centre of the war party in Russia, in which he expressed a hope that a definitive treaty of peace would shortly be concluded, which, but for later news, would look decidedly warlike when taken in connexion with the fact that Russia is pressing Turkey for payment of an impossible indemnity, and that the troops in possession of Adrianople and other important strategical positions are not to be withdrawn until the British fleet has left the sea of Marmora This seems a rather improbable contingency, in view of the bitter experience which the English Government has had of the Punic faith of Russia That power appears to have been employing allherdiplomatic wales to inveigle Turkey into an offensive and defensive alliance with her and an article which appears in the soles of the 17th of October kit is one of the most amusingly Transparent exhibitions of cajolery and binney we ever remember to have met with that paper has eli covered that the "atrocities' which produced such a painful excitement in Europe were only a passing phase " menon, produced by special circum- " stances ' At bottom the Turk a really good fellow, who has been very much misunderstood " The Osmauh " far from being a savage, is good natured " and laborious if not clover ' Not only so, but he is ready to do in the w order, for the Golds proceeds to observe -' It 13 " impossible to deny that our own ' troops returning home speak a great " did me 10 of the prosperity they found " in 1 inkey than of the barbarity of the " Turks Consequently, Mr GladSTONe s " big and baggage prescription finds no five in 111 St Petersburg just now on the contrary, the new phrase is, Let us kiss and be friends, and the unspoken thought of the Czar is, " In that cv cut 1 can make use of the Gain, h of the faithful to " stir up the Mohammed m population " of India against then English 11113 ' ters 1 uljiuLjing from recent tde giants, and the clinics at 6 nativity nople, the relations between the British Government and the Sublime Porte are becoming closer tlnnbcfoie, and are likely to be such as will " ensure greater influence and the right " of intervention on the part of Great Britain in the affairs of Turkey Ti in time to time flashes of light are thrown upon the proceedings in connexion with the recent and notorious "West Melbourne election! Glimpses are obtained of what was going on behind the scenes, and how an scrupulously the Government worked in the departments as well as in the election booth the suspicions aroused and expressed at the time obtain con formation the legal proceedings in the case of Mr D Wai Lulu showed what manner of men were put 111 the polling booths, and now, by means of the evidence taken by the select committee of the Legislative Council with regard to the issue of free railway passes, we have something of a view how Mr Woods was simultaneously operating in the Railway department The evidence taken by the committee was, so to speak, dragged out of the officers of the department These gentlemen spoke on the subjects of the West Melbourne election with marked reluctance, and perhaps they are not to be blamed for their reticence in the matter A civil servant who is required to tell the truth, and he whole truth, and who is under Mr Woods, is to be pitied rather than reproached, when he judiciously says as little as possible Ino civil servant can forget that when Mr AN 00DS was examined before a select committee as a public officer, he did not tell the whole truth, and, moreover, the punishment of the officers who exposed his lapse from virtue, is still fresh in memory But quite sufficient was elicited to establish the claim of the Minister of Piaihvajs to first place for unscrupulousness among the unscrupulous AA. c feel a reluctance to mention the names of the officers who gave evidence, lest even then guarded admissions should cause insult or injury to be inflicted upon them, but some of the facts elicited 111 examination may be stated in the first place, we learn that free passes have never been " sought after not looked for save and 1 except in relation to the two West Mel " bourne elections There have been fierce contests before in this district, but until the appearance of Mr 'W 00D1 and Sir BiixA^i 0 Lochlea on the scene, the free pass necessity did not arise It burst on the department all at once. The idea flashed on the wire- pullers and election workers, that absent employs ought to have passes to enable them to come to town, and they proceeded to operate upon it. Of course, if the arrangement had been done Jun the name of the railway officer to whom the pass was issued could have been stated on the face of the document, together with the place he was to travel from, and it is declared 111 evidence to be the rule of the department to insert these 1 articulara 111 all cases But Mr Woods rose superior to rule 0n this occasion Free passes were issued at pleasure and in blank passes enabling anybody to travel over the lines whether he was a railway servant or otherwise The passes, to use an expression given in evidence, were as "transferable as " coins The customary checks were altogether disregarded, because, as we may infer they stood in the way Mr Woods took one batch of these blank passes, and no doubt he made good use of them We are not altogether without knowledge of his basis of distribution, for among the documents obtained by the committee is a telegram from the faithful Ali I Hunt, " Send pass Elector Kilmore to Mel " bourne and return, first the case, no doubt, is typical The zealous Ministenalist discovers a real living O'Loghlen voter at Kilmore He does not waste words to say whether the man is a railway servant 01 not, and the Minister does not stop to inquire Here is a vote to be seemed and, as the return shows, the pass is despatched off hand the same day in the same way Major Smith applies for many blank passes and gets them So does that useful, if not eminent, Ministerialist, M Brophy, M L A But the bulk of the documents are disposed of in a still more suspicious and unsatisfactory way they are absolutely handed twenty six at one time, and others on various occa Bions-to Mr James Dallas, of the Dudley street rolling mills It was in the yard of the Dudley street rolling mills that Sir Bryan 0 Logullv made his opening speech Mr Dull and not that he was a committee man in the first election, and that " he took an " active part in the second election, and it is notorious on which committee his name appeared, and on which side he was active If we describe him as a thoroughgoing O'Loghlen partisan, we do him little, if any, injustice, and this was the man who was supplied with free blank passes when ever he chose to ask for them And when the committee inquired about the Dallas passes, and wished to see the documents themselves, to ascertain if there were any traces of their use upon them, they received the reply -"Sent to the paper mills' The remark of one member of the committee, who seemed able to estimate the trans action was, "The sooner they went there the better " Our optimists, and those who decline to believe that departmental corruption is possible in Victoria, may be invited to consider these facts There was no occasion to issue more passes in connexion with the recent West Melbourne election than there was in connexion with previous electoral events It was monstrous to issue passes in blank But if such passes were to be honestly used, common decency forbade that they should be placed in the handset Mr jAiitaDvLLVs no one will suppose for a moment that any member of the committee of Mr J G Eran ers, or any man who was taking an active part in the election in the interests of the Opposition candidate, could go to the Railway department and could apply for passes in blank Yet Mr Brophy could, Major fvMnii could, Mr Hunt could, and above all, so could Mr J uses D ixl yes When incidents such as these can be proved from the official records, we may imagine what favouritism and white intimidation remain in the background It would seem that, given a bold bad Minister, said anything can be done in such a district as the Railway division The electors know that they me at his mercy, that he can reward them 01 nun them, and the wholesale issue of passes to his friends and sup j orders would in itself be an indication to them of the lengths to which he would be prepared to go Corruption and tor loving walk hand in hand in such cases What with the open canvass made by Mr Woods, what with these passes in Maul, and what with the polling booth practices, more than sufficient ex idence Ins leaked out to establish a case of undue influence at West Melbourne, but, of course, even if the facts had become known in time, in appeal to our present electoral the burial would have been useless It is something, however, to know the ii nth, and to be aware that though Ministers boast of the result of the West Melbourne contest, and though the Governor mentions it in his despatches in terms of congratulation, yet all parties to the transaction ought really to hang their heads in shame And we may also congratulate ourselves upon the circumstance that there is still in existence a second House, which can drag into the daylight some of the secrets vinchapartymajority elsewlioiearemost anxious should not be disclosed Here, as in other instances, we have patent proofs that it would be an ill day for Victoria if ever the second Chamber should cease to be a power in the land Our cable messages to day contain in telligence of an important success on the part of the British forces in Afghanistan The column marching from Kohat under Major General Roberts has obtained complete possession of the I'eivvar Pass and its fortifica- lions after an engagement in which the enemy. suffered enormous loss while the casualties amongst the attacking force were exceedingly trifling amounting to scarcely 100 killed and wounded he result of this encounter is encouraging, for it shows that the Afghans, even their own strongholds, are no match for the troops which the Indian Government is able to JirtiiL, against them The policy of the British Government has been endorsed by Parliament the address in reply to the Queen a speech Imuiij, been carried in both Houses Major General 1 Sleigh Roberts V C C B The officer who commands the Kohat column advancing into Afghanistan, and who has recently gained the victory at Paivvar, is a colonel in the Royal Artillery (late Bengal) and quartermaster general on the staff of the Bengal army, and while filling that position ci joy is the local rank of major general The gallant officer saw much active service during the Indian mutiny and received the Victoria Cross for personal bray cry The Session was closed j ester lay with very little ceremony So much of Parliament yard had been fenced in by the contractors that only one narrow approach to the Council Chamber was left open and there was barely room for the guard of honour and about 200 spectators The local Artillery Corps under the command of Captain Stubbs as usual, constituted the guard The number of ladies present in the Council Chamber on the floor and in the goUcrica was but moderate not more than 12 members of the House in addition to the President, were in attendance It was expected that the Governor would appear immediately after 12 but an unusual delay occurred Presently however the cause was explained by the receipt of a message from the Assembly, ask mg the Council to assent to a formal amendment required in the Land Act Amendment Bill and suggested through His Excellency the Governor 'The arrival of the Governor therefore, had to be held back until the formal assent of the two Houses to the correction had been obtained 'The first gun announcing the departure of His Excellency from the Treasury was heard at 17 minutes past 12 The escort on this occasion consisted of mounted police Lady Bowen, attended by her four daughters took her place on the right back bench shortly afterwards The only member of the consular tod) present was the consul general for the United States, Mr Spencer, to whom the ceremony of prorogation as conducted in this colony was entirely new The guard of honour presented arms on the arrival of the Governor at the entrance to Parliament house and His Excellency appeared in the Council chamber at 22 minutes past 12 The Speaker and members of the Assembly were summoned to the bar, and the Royal assent was given to the last two measures of the session-the Land Bill and the Appropriation Bill Then followed the speech, and Parliament was prorogued to the 14th January next The speech delivered by the Governor yesterday was necessarily of brief proportions, for it was the epitome of an almost fruitless Session Only three measures were referred to the Loan Act, the Amended Land Act, and the Amending Customs Act Address mg the members of the Assembly only, His I excellency said "My advisers will take steps to carry into effect your expressed washes for

farewell 10 Minutes conversation Mr Bent utilised the time by requesting the Chief Secretary to take the case of Mr Doran, the Inglewood railway contractor, into consideration during the recess and Mr

morning with stealing Is , the property of the company Owing to the short cash returns from the fare box of one of the omnibuses on the railroad line, of which the prisoner was the driver, Stirling was suspected of having tampered with the fire box of the vehicle, and on Friday night in order to detect the supposed thief a plan was hit upon which proved successful At about a quarter past 11 o'clock Detective Dow den and a f nena got into the omnibus driven by Stirling, and placed in the fair box two sixpenny pieces which had been previously marked When the vehicle was put up for the night at the stables, the prisoner was searched, and one of the marked coins was found in his possession, the other being in the change box The manner in which the driver had abstracted the coins from the fare boxvvossome what ingenious A piece of steel bent at one end in the shape of a book was inserted into the box, and by means of a small groove at the end of the hook the coins were in some man ner slid on to the bent end of the steel, and thus extracted from the box The trick was explained to the Bench by Detective Berrill, and the prisoner was remanded until Wednesday next Between the hours of 1 and 0 yesterday morning the Sir John Franklin Hotel, Victoria parade, was broken into by thieves, who carried away a number of bottles of spirits, a quantity of tobacco, and a small sum of money which was in the till in the bar The burglars effected an entrance by climbing on the verandah and getting through a window During the early hours of yesterday morning the Grace Darling Hotel, in Smith street, was also broken into, when wearing apparel to the amount of £3 15s was stolen out of the hall The thieves appear to have gone into the bar, and after having helped themselves to the liquors, robbed the till, which contained about one pounds worth of silver, and also carried away a quantity of cigars The burglars effected an entrance by forcing open the kitchen window An intelligent looking lad, named Henry Earl, was brought before the City Bench yesterday on remand as a neglected child The lad, who is an orphan, is entitled to a legacy of £500 on his coming of age, and upon the death of his mother some months ago, he was placed under the guardianship of Mr. William Wright, grocer, of Queensberry street, Carlton It seems, however, that the lad was given to running away from his home, and on a recent occasion he was found wandering on the beach at Brighton He was eventually handed over to the care of Mrs Mackay, the wife of a respectable artisan residing at Windsor, who exhibited a motherly care for the young orphan, and from whom he received the advantages of a comfortable home The lads stepsister, who is a well known actress, appeared in court, and expressed her willingness that he should be taken care of by Mr Wright, the lawful guardian of the boy Mr Wright informed the Bench that arrangements had been made to send the lad to Ballarat, where he would be placed under the control of a relative of his mother As the lads stepsister offered no objection to this course, the youngster was discharged by the Bench and left the Court with Mr Wright and his stepsister The lad did not appear to be a neglected child in a strict sense of the term, as before he left the precincts of the court he was claimed by no less than four different persons, who seemed very anxious to take charge of the orphan Young Earl sobbed bitterly and begged to be allowed to go home with Mrs Mackay, but after a slight altercation between Mr Mackay and Ina foster parent, the lad was taken away by Mr W right and his stepsister A notorious offender named James Corn gan was brought before the City Bench yesterday on a charge of stabbing Constable Brennan with a knife At about 1 o'clock on the morning of the 30th of last month Brennan had occasion to interfere in a disturbance which took place at the corner of A'Beckett and Stewart streets between above ral loose characters of both sexes, the prisoner being amongst the number Constable Brennan dispersed the mob, and proceeded in the direction of Swanston street in order to resume duty, but was followed by Corrigan, who seemed determined to be revenged upon the constable Corrigan came up with the constable at the corner of A Beckett-street, and upon Brennan advising him to go home, the follow suddenly rushed at him, and stabbed him with a knife in three places in a most brutal manner The constable at once closed with the ruffian, and with the assistance of a night watchman named M m Daly, Corrigan was handcuffed and taken to the day with the Constable Brennan was conveyed to the Melbourne Hospital, where he was attended to by Mr Charles Scott, one of the resident medical officers who found that he had received a severe wound on the breast, and two other wounds of a more or less serious nature under the shoulder blade and in the ribs He was subsequently removed to the hospital at the Richmond police depot, and under careful treatment had sufficiently recovered yesterday to enable him to appear in court against his assailant The Bench, after hearing the evidence, committed the prisoner for trial at the Central Criminal Court on the 16th mat The dead body of a male child, apparently about three months old, was found yesterday morning lying on the roadside leading from Hotham to
