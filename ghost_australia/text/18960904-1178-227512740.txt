Water -making freely In roof of. the drive. Stopes of usual size showing fair gold." A development which Is likely to be of some Importance has occurred at Ghost Gully G.M. Co., Steel's Creek (Vic.) A body of decomposed blue slate was met In the crosscut at a depth of 100ft.; It runs north and south, underlying to the west. Mr. Dowdoll, the manager, has had a parcel tested, with the result that it Is estimated to contain loz. gold and 19dwt. silver to the ton. Twelve feet of this have been gone through without touching the hanging wall. The Laura correspondent of the South Australian "Advertiser" writes: — "I am informed that a man who has been pro specting In the Flinders Range has dis covered a gold-hearing reef, but Is keep ing the locus In quo secret. This goes to confirm the often expressed opinion that there Is plenty of gold 111 South Australia if It is only properly looked for." Alluvial wash is still being raised all along the line at Carlisle. It is es timated there are 1000 loads at grass. The reefs continue to look promising, especially the prospectors', which Is improving as greater depth is reached. A Cumnock correspondent, in writing to a Molong paper, says; — It may be Interesting to know that Mr. Thomas II. Brogden, one of the present share holders and prospectors of the Goumbla mine, was the discoverer of tho Parkes goldlield in 1871, and although he has repeatedly applied for tho Government reward he has never yet received It. I hear he has again, applied, through Dr. Ross, M.L.A., for some recognition of his past hard labours, and in all justice he should receive it. Better late than never.. A telegram recoivod by the Victorian Minos Department from Bairnsdale states that a crushing of stono taken from the Royal Mint Mine at the Bemin River had yielded about 4oz. to tho ton.
