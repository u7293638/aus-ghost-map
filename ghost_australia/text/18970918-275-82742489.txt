SOARED TEE GHOST. During a confirmation tour in tho diocese of Potorborough, Dr. Creighton, tho present Bishop of London, put up one evening in an old manor house, and slept in a room supposed to be haunted. Next morning at breakfast the Bishop was asked whether he had seen the ghost. 'Yes,' he replied, with great solemnity; 'but I have laid the spirit, It will never trouble you again.' On being further interrogated as to what lie had done, the bishop saidâ€” ? . ' The ghost instantly vanished when I. asked for a subscription owards the restoration of Peter borough Cathedral.' On a fino day it ia rockoned that the cyclists of the world cover tho grand total of 100,000,000 miles, or 4,000 times round tho world.
