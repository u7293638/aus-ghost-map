SIR E. BRADDON AT RIANA. The Right Hon Sir Edward Braddon addressed the electors of West Devon at Riana on Wednesday evening at the school-house, which was filled to over- flowing. The chair was well occupied by Mr Hynes. The candidate first proceeded to explain certain statements made by Dr McCall at his meeting the evening before, which were communicated to Sir Edward on his arrival. Dr McCall's efforts to connect Sir Edward with the Miles scandal, the New Norfolk Asylum, the doctor's " poor man" support and the Collett land, sales were dealt with by Sir Edward in a clear, forcible manner, the refuting of the little indictments creating ghosts of laughter and applause. Sir Edward evidently enjoyed the keen attention of the young fellows present, which seemed to inspire him and bring out some of his old platform fire. A unanimous vote of confidence was carried, the chairman pointedly asking for the hands of those who were for, and then for those who were against. "God Save the Queen," with three cheers " for the boys in South Africa," concluded the meeting.
