THE IBSEN GIRL. Oil, gather round, ye critics, whilst I sing a simple lay, I'll tell a gruesome story of the mournful latter day— Th6 old, old tale of how a man with but few wits to spare . Can found a school, and play the fool, and capture women fair. Hush, hush, husht Hen comes the Ibsen edrl! So shut your eyes and close your ears, or else your brain will whirl. Hush, hush, hush 1 She's got her hair in curl, That Amazon of modern days, the awful Ibsen girl! She'll prate about her mission and the glories she descries In tragedies which taught her first husband to de pise; She'll talk without a single blush of things she ought to Doe Sim was a child; but now she's wild to prove her iibartvl liberty! Hush, hush, hush! &c.; She has a soul which always yearns its message to declare— A gospel of short petticoats and frizzy towzled hair; She raves of "ghosts" and "Rosmersholm" and "lady from the Sea," For 'tis a sin to baulk her individuality. Hush, bush, hush! &c.; She gabbles about "Gabler" and the joys of suicide, And points out with emotion how the headstrong "Hedda"died; Slio claims to be a " Nora," too, if only she may floor A husband's right, and say good-night, and bang the outer door! HnBh, hush, hush! d'c. She casts away all prejudice about the true and good; "Rebecca" is the fairest pearl of perfect woman hood. Oh, listen while "the Master" speaks. Like fifty thousand chimes, He says, "I am the only ilrain-atist of recent times!" Hush, hush, hush! &c.; —St. James'# Oa-sette.
