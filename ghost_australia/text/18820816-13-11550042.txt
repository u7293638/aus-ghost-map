WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1832. The attendance at the banquet given to Sir ÜLNrY F utia a yesterday even ing was fully representativo of liol bourne as a commercial city And the assemblage may be taken as a pract cal demonstration that the community has no sympathy whatever with the per sistent attempts made here, m season and out of season, to disparage a states man whom the people of the sister colony elect to honour This is as it should be It would not be in accordance with the fitness of things that there should exist a trace of animosity in Victoria towards the accepted leader of a km dred people The presence of Mr BEErY was, it is to be presumed, an indication that the politicians of the Radical party do not sj mpathise w ith the action of the radie ti press, but aro keen enough to see that to disparage the chief chosen by manhood suilnge elsewhere, because he is a freetrader, is to insult manhood sufFngo itaelf For our part, we are sure that in giving a hearty and even enthusiastic welcome to a public man who has woithilj maintained the piestige and the honour of the colonies in LngUnd and abroad, the citizens did much to show that Melbourne has claims to be const dered not only the chief city of Vic tona, but also the metropolis of Austra lia Suth is the place we would c1 um for her And it is only to bo won by rising, as the citizens did yesterday, above local and psisonal jealousies, md displaying a metropolitan spirit The Mayor touched the proper note when he said that what the people of Victoria lemember about Sir IILMI\ PARKES and what they íespect lura for, is, that he has not only spoken, but he has written, and ho has not only written, but he has acted, in favour of the union of the colonies " Federation " and " intercolonial free " trade " were words to conjure cheers with j esterday evening, and in so far as the assemblage was of a íepreseiitativo character, this display of feeling must be regarded as a hopeful sign of the times If the will exists to bring about a union, sooner or later the way imi3t be found SirITiNr\ PVPKII, by virtue of his long e\penence, is keen to detect the prevailing sentiment of his audience, md w ith his accustomed tact ho rightly attributed the warmth of his reception not only to the geneious feeling of Vic toi ian colonists, but also to a strong and growing desire for intercolonial friendship and union Tho whole of this portion of his speech may be studied with advantage, for it is health) in tone as well as eloquent in matter Theie is no ^ ictorian, he says, who more earnestly desires the prosperity of Victoria than does the Premier of New South Wales New South Wales can gain nothing by any mischance to us Our advance must be hers As he truly sajs, tho man who believes otherwise is a wilful child The large affairs of men are not so managed All this, of couise, can be read backwards, and can be taken as a rebuke to those politicians who have displayed the perverseness which the lion gentle man ridicules, and have sought to build up the one colony by injuring the other who have, for instance, sought to pre vent Sydney buying wattle bark from us, and have endeavoured to stop the access of lliverma cattle to the Mel bourne market Sir HENTY PvriCLS saj s that he cares not a straw for a policy that consists of imposing taxes on "jews'harps and buttons " Soonei or later tho laws of nature and of humanity must sweep such puny offorts away An immediate union, as he declares, may not be possible, but wo must all heartily endorse his dictum that it is madness and wickedness to preach doctrines of opposition and of antagonism between colonies which are manifestly intended by nature to be one, and which are peopled by men and women of the same race and the same nation and who speak the same tongue It was not to be expected that the guest of the evening would enter into dptailp regarding his experiences abroad If he has a tale to unfold he reserves it, as a matter of course, for the colony of which he is the political head He tells us that he never failed to assert the loyalty of Australia to the British Crown The connexion between the Empireand the colonies will, ho believes, pndure through unending years, but Australia should learn not to lean upon England for aid She should, for in stance, defend herself, and not be a charge upon the overburdened British taxpayer Sir HENKY PARKES also tells us that ho always declared that the quarrels between Victoria and New South Wales are so trivial tha* there is nothing to prevent their federal union at an early date He has returned strongly impressed with the conviction that Australia has a magnificent future before her, a^ that she can afford to trust in heiaelf She has no need, he says, " to manufacturo manufactures " Sho can afford to wolcome imtni gration Indeed, as he points out if the doctrino that the prosperity of a colony is to bo judged by the smallness of its population and the largeness of ita resources, then the pre mier position of the Australian group would bolong to Western Australia with its 30,000 inhabitants and its enormous territory What Australia necc's, he aflirms, is union, and hia cou viction is stronger th in over tint it 13 for the two great south eastern colonies Victoria and New South Wales, to take the first step, their Governments an proaclnng each other, not as has been too often the case, in a jealous, grudging spnit-the one dcirous of taking some small sharp advantage of the other-but rather m a spirit of emulation m generous advance The speech will no doubt be widely read, and it Bhould do its share towards advancing the desired end It is pleasant to find that travel has hardened Sir HFNRY PARM S in his determination to constitute himself a champion of an Australia which shall be both federal and freo Wo m ty hope that he will not weary in well dom ' that he will not omit to translate senti mont into action, and that ho will find a people on both sides of the Murray ready to open their hearts to receive his precepts._ Last Wednesday evening Mr Wiuxov moved in the Assembly -" That a 1 Belect committee bo appointed to m " quire into and repoit upon tho " existing defects in the hw, and in tho " management of the public service, aud " the means by which those defects eau " bo best remedied ' Civil service reform is one of thoso practical questions to which Victorian Ministries and Parliaments display decided anti pith) Twelve years ago a lloj al Com mission was issued to do tho very work which Mi WriviN would now confide to a select committee Numerous witnesses were examined by that Com mission, and every encouragement waa given to those who had information to afford, or desired an opportunity of expressing their Mews A full report, based upon the evidence, was diawn up, and printed in duo course flie voluminous treatise was distributed is usual with a liberal hand, and then it was straightway forgotten J ho inquiry must have cost thousands of pounds m the shape of clerical work, shorthand notes, paper, printing, ile , to say nothing of the time and labour expended hy the commissioners But not ouo of the sue gestions formulated at BO great a coit has been carried into effect So far as the public is concerned, its money nn¿ht just as well have been thrown into tho sea Government after Government h is promised to t ike tLe matter m hand, and nearly every vice retal pre sessional speech dunng the list ten years has admitted the necessity for action But all interest in the matter has begun and ended in words, and we question whether any Ministry has ever gone the length of considering the principles on which reorganisation should be effected Having regard to these tacts, wo cannot say that we look on Mr WRIVON'S proposal with favour Any inquiry now set on foot would 111 evitably go over a great deal of tho ground which was covered by the former investigation We do not want more knowledge so much as energy to act oa what is already m our possession It may be, as Mr WRIXOY says, that tho Boyal Commission of 1870 did not give its attention to the question of appoint- ments to the public service or to the e\ ils of political patronage, but any Ministry desiring to deal with the sub ject 111 a comprehensive way would find all requisite information in the reports of the British Civil Service commis sioners, and similar documents issued by foreign Governments If the mero fact of taking tua vote evidence would secure rcpect fortbe suggestions founded on it, we could understand that some good puipo=e would bo served by an Hide pendent investigation , but as we know that evidence and repoits alike go to lumber bookshelves and depreciate the value of waste paper, we cannot sea how the desired reform is to be pro moted by «armning more witresse? And while a commission would not bo at all likely to discover anything that is not now at the service of Ministers, it would inevitably furnish excuse for further delay While tho inquiry w13 going on, the mere fact of its being in progress would bo a sufficient answer to ill those restless spirits who thuil tint a matter of gi eat practical importance «hould be dealt with in something less than a century After it had finished a new point of departure would remain, from which continued neglect would be dated At present Parliament has succeeded in "notdoing "it ' duung a period of twelve j ears, and it is possible that aftei a few mmo have passed away, the growing number may cause members to suspect that it is almost time to think about doing some thing But if we once commonce a new era dating from a fresh report, we should have to go through anothei decade or two of absolute indifférence before any faint prickings of the legislative con science would be excited While we do not think that Mr WRIXON's proposed method of proce dure is that most likely to lead to prac- tical íesults, we consider that the couti tiy at large is under an obligation to him for having drawn attention to tbo matter. We are in hopes that haung once put his hand to the plough, there will be no looking back, until in some way or other he Ima brought civil service reform to a definite issue Nothing could well be more unsatis factory than the present position of affairs Nine tenths of those in the em ploj ment of the state are outside the pro visions of the existing act There are some 17,546 persons drawing pay from the public treasury, and out of these only 1,703 are classified under the statute The 18,813 employes who only rank as supernumeraries are completely at the mercy of Ministers They are appointed without examination, and hold office solely by favour Their pay, their increments, their promotion, their retiring allowances, are absolutely ana solely dependent on the whims of weir patrons or the gentlemen who succeed them in the management ot tue several departments. Mr. BLRRY says that while it is true that only about one tenth of the public ser vants are under the Civil Servi Act, practically nearly all share tue benefits which result from its provisions. " Nearly all 1" It is evident, then, th there are exceptions Assuming, f the sake of argument, that the c centions have nothing to do wi favouritism or revenge, it is evident th the feeling of

Several other amendments were made on the clause, which, aa ultimately paBsed, will be found in another column Whon the committee got to clause 23, which empowers the local bodies to purchase the tramwayB after the expiry of 21 yeara, Mr Walsh, one of the members of the committee, Biiggeated that, aB only six members were preaent, the clauses Bhould bo postponed. Mr. Purvea, for the local bodies, suggested that evidence might bo called to show that the period named waB too long Mr Webb characterised this as a breach of faith, on the ground that the pro- moters and the representatives of the local bodies had agreed to the clause as it stood. After Borne discussion the clause was post- poned, and the committee adjourned until to morrow. The Police Commission sat yesterday fore noon, when there were present Messrs Longmore (chairman), Hall, Finoham, Ander- son, and Dixon. No witnesses were examined, but the greater portion of the sitting was devoted to a considération of the corres- pondence which had passed between the commission and the Chief Secretary in re- ference to the inquiry into the charges against Superintendent Winch. Other accusations against that officer have been lodged with the commission, and they decided to await the decision of the board which had been appointed to deal with the Rowe case before they took any action in the matter.
