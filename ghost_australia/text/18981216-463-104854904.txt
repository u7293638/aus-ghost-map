POETRY. DESERTED. This is the homestead—the still lagoon Kisses the foot of the garden fence, Shimmering under a silver moon In a midnight silence, cold and tense; Vines ran wild on the old verandah, Holding their arms to us standing by. Garden paths where we used to wander, Carry the bush grass rank and high. Here and there has a blossom stayed Out of the wreck of the passing years; But these will wither, for flowers must fade Whose only water is salt sea tears. There are ghosts in the garden wildernesses, And gliding wraiths at the water side, Murmur of voices and rustle of dresses-- Shadow life that has never died. The stock yard is empty and dim and drear; Here and there is a gap in the rails, But I can see as we stand a-near, Moving steeds where the daylight fails— I see as I stand at the slip rails dreaming Many riders that mount and meet, Sun on the saddles gleaming, gleaming, Red dust wrapping the horses' feet. The world is silent under the stars, And yet there comes to my ear alone The tiny clink of the snaffle bars As the eager heads are upward thrown, And the sound of the muffled hoof beat after Strikes like a hammer on heart and brain; And the faint, far echo of drifting laughter Wakens the strength of a sleeping pain. Come, come away from the lonely home, Softly, softly as mourners tread; The world is wide—there is space to roam Without awaking the sleeping dead. Till the last of the scattered flowers shall wither, The last of the stock yard rails decay, Till the old walls crumble and fall together, The ghost will move in the moonlight grey. —W. H. OGILVIE.
