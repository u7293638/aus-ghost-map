CHAPTER VIL " Come here a minute; I want to speak to yon, Dorothy," said Ted, peremptorily, poit . ting his hand upon Dorothy's arm. •« Gome here, round the garden." It wai the d&y; after be Had offended her, and the girl h&d; been very cool and distant to him as they played tennis all the afternoon, until at last, the game being ended, hp end denly took matters into his own hands in this way. " What do you want to fifty—anything par ticular?" asked the girl, with a swift look around. Hia answer was not audible to anyone hat himself, bat Dorothy yielded to the hand on her arm. and went slowly by his side. | Some twenty minutes later, perhaps, and with no thought of spying, Michael Berlhon, i with a pips between his lips, sauntered on in I s contrary direction to th™ one they had taken and came saddenly npon th6 two stand ing close together beneath atree in the shrub bery, -talking so earnestly that they- did not perceive his approach. Dorothy held something in her hand at whioh Bhe gazed admiringly, and Hiohael'a far-sighted eyes saw that it was a handsome gold locket set vith gleaming atones* with eomethingdarkinside like a picture. " Oh, Ted, it is lovely 1" the girl cried, rapturously, as she clasped it and slipped it. into her pocket, And the likeness is splen did, too flattering of yoa—that isthe only thing," with her low, gay langh. "I don't think,4hav'*etarpe<I Ted with conviction. - " You are very conceited. 'However,-thank yon very much. Now Ireally think ycudo mean—'. " I mean every word I, eaj on. this sofa j^et,' Dorothy," said Ted, with a euddenear* neeteets his brother had neyerjbeard in his oatelesa voice before. " My dear little girl, beljeve me, if ever a man ioved awoman deeply, ttruly— ; But then Michael's shadow fell across them < '• Xr-': j and both started and looked ap. Dorothy; oolGreajTedlanghedeMily. " ^ "r "Haveyon $otanybaecy»there, old man <" he aeked, drawing out his pipe-end turning to his brother. But Dorothjr, with one hand In her pocket in a pretty, childishway, gavea qnick glance into Berthon's face—unaccountably it had grown grave and stern—turned and flitted away from them without a word. Left to'themselves the brothers Btrolled smoking ronnd the garden. Though he strove to think nothing of it the picture he had seen haunted Berthon—the handBome . man with his earneet expression bending over the lair, listening girl. Ted was not given to earnest ness about nothing. .Yet if a &eaning; there [Were to the eoene he ha£ beheld, Barthon eonld take his oath that Harry Shad well and his wile were ignorant of it; and surely Dorothy was too ingenuous, too b weetly trans parent, to be suspected of hiding a love secret from her parents. It could not mean that, Michael told himself over and over again as he noted Dorothy's off-hand, easy manner to his brother, and his careless disregard of her at times, yet, until its meaning were proved that picture beneath the trees haunted his peace of mind. The summer went on, and at laBt a monster pienie took place in the woods by the river, at some little distance from the Beeches. The world and his wife were there, crowding op the sunlit stream is boats, ohatting and flirting and making merry with much noise, if not thorough enjoyment'-. . " What is the matter, Mr. Berthon $ You look as if you had seen a ghost," Dorothy's laughing voice asked, as the boats were un lading their gay freight tinder the welcome shade of the trees. . ' " Worse," lie replied " Dorothy, tell me if that lady is married or not" Dorothy followed the. direction of his eyes toward a tall, dark, and decidedly dashing lady, whose dress was the youngest thing about her, and_ehe herself, perhaps, the most striking form visible in the crowd. " No, she isn't; she is a Miss Claridge,! think," she replied. "I knew it," groaned Berthon. " Dorothy, if you see her making a set at me, come to my side, there is • dear." He had just time to utter the woids when Theo Claridge espied his tall form and ap proaohedhim. . ] "Oh, you delightful, wicked.Mr. Berthon, never to let us have an idea that you were not baking in India yet 1 Dorothy never told me; but then Dorothy has been a perfect fiend of a friend of late; she has never an swered my last six letters. What do yon think of that 7" "Ladies' friendships are al way evanescent, are they not ?" the tall, bronzed man who had faced Stigers in their jungle without a muscle moving, but who felt all his courage deserting him now, responded weakly. '' Mine are not, I remember every woman friend that I ever had, and every man friend, too. tl have not forgotten those charming weeks we spent together at The Beeches," lowering her voiceVentimentally and raising her eyes in a manner that increased his ter ror. " Six or eight—how many years ago?" ." Sixteen. We are getting old, Miss Cla rioge," he responded, promptly, '* You barbarian, to hint at such a thing. A man is never older than he likes, you know, and a woman is never older than she looks. How old do you think I look now?" she smilea, bringing the full array of her charms before him suddenly. ^ "" I never guessed a woman's age correctly in my life." " Ah, non-committal, I see," shaking & Soger of ^ her long glove afe him archly. " Never mind, come and sit here by me yes, there is plenty of room,- really—and let us talk over those sweet old days. So you never got captivated in India all those years?" Never; I am quite impregnable," he an swered, modestly. "Ah, don't you boast anything so un masculine you are just on the point of sur render, I Ehould say, from that secure de meanor. Very likely to-day may seal your fate," said Miss Claridge with a loud laugh. *' I hope not !'* he answered with an un feigned shudder. '• Mr. Berthon, will you come and help me' spread this table cloth V" asked fcindly Doro thy, coming op. j '* Forward Jitlle chit," pronounced Miss Claridge, but half sot/o voce. I will come.tc-o, 11 may as well be nselul as ornamental," she I added aloud, rising to her feet and tripping by Michael's side. Theo Claridge, as time went oil, had be come discontented with her name. Twice | during Berthon's stay abroad she had been | engaged to change it. but each time,-through I some little thing—probably the very sharp I temper for which she grew more and more famed as she grew older—the engagement had fallen through and left her Miss Claridge, Etill, When she saw Michael Berthon, hand some, stately and fascinating as of . yore, she suddenly lelt assured that she bad loved hint deeply in those bygone days, and that hers was a .heart that could never forget. «. '* Wfiy has he remained single all these yeai-B ?" she asked herself. «■ Sorely he, too, cared more than either of us knew in those yonng and foolish-dayb." The only drawback was that Miss Claridge waB only in that neighborhood for the day. She had come down from London with Bome friends for this picnic, and no hint that she could think of would make her former friend, Mrs. Shadweil, give her an in vitation. " Since Theo haB become so loud and fast, the less isee of her the better." Dorothy said to her husband. ■ With the unceremonious ease which was her -way Miss Claridge said,— '• I engage you, Mr. Berthon, to show me the beauties of these woods after luncheon. I expect you know them all thorotfghly; how. many dozens-of picnics have you flirted at here, I wonderl" with an arch glance andkil ling smile. " They are so altered since my time," said the man hastily. " I really know nothing about them, Miss Claridge." » Oh, that is still more charming, then, we will explore them together," replied the lady, helping herself to lobster salad. ' _ 1 have promised to be at fliisB Shadweil soomtnand this afternoon," he f aid hurriedly. " *fa,en 8,30 mast come with us. How toe chUd has grown;« returned Theo, con descendingly. "Nioe looking, do you think her ?

' Then luck favored him ; as he reached his -friend, a tree hid him from Miss Claridge's bold, black eyes, and Dorothy Shadweil was standing by her father's side. "Do jrou want me, Mr. Berthon!" asked, brightly. " I thought you lookedap. pealing fiveminutes ago over Miss Claridge'e head." ; ' i% Have a eare iHiirt yoa are doing with that woman, or you will Seliook$d to a cer tainty,"saidShadweiL " She is a most in veterate huntress, now her chances ait small, you know, and you are an Eligible party; you ^ should never lose remembrance of that. mv^ deatiaiow."
