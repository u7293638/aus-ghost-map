A BAPTISMAL CEREMONY. About half-past eight on Sunday evening | last two | seamen belonging to the ship 0 Duncow, named Pierce and Findlay, were | inducted a la John the Baptist as members a of the Baptist denomination in,the presence 8 of some fifty persons. The Jordan of this a occasion was not a fresh water stream, bnt a the briny jocean fronting Mr James LiUing r tou’s ladies' baths at the Sont’a Beach, Wil ^ liamstown. Preliminaries commenced by g the singing of an apnropriatq hymn, during . which the converts dispensed for tho nonce ' with their own clothing and arrayed them 6 selves in Jwhite. The Bev. John Downing ■i then proceeded down the stops, followed by r the snorter convert. As tho tide was low ] t the ceremonists had to proceed some little i . distance out in order to obtain sufficient j* depth of water to ensnre complete immersion. k The rev. j gentleman thon baptised each in y turn in the name of tho Father, Son and j Holy Ghost, while those assembled sang “ Just as ;I am without one plea.” The pro ceedings j closed with some explanatory 8 remarks by Mr Downing relative to what had n taken place. He stated that according to J the Baptist faith it was necessary for these . men to make the public profession of their 1 convictions, which they had just done. The 0 unscasonabieness of the hour arose from the n fact that owing to the profane profession of n the men! (seamen) no other time Could be found to suit their convenience. He then exhortedlothers to follow the example shown them anil thuB prove their love lor Jesus ! Christ. The benediction having been pro s noonced the assemblage dispersed.
