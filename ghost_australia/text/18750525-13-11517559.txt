TUESDAY, MAY 25, 1875. Tho Becond Bcssion of the eighth Victorian Parliament will be oponed to- day by Hia Excollency Sir W. F. Stawell, the officer administering the Government. There has seldom been a time when the mooting of Parliament has boen moro anxiously anticipated than at present. Truo, many of the questions which requiro settlomont, and which aro sure to find a place in tho Viceregal deliverance, havo formed pro- minent topics of discuBB.on and the chief matter for Governors' speechss at the opening of Bucceaaivo Parliaments for years past. Thoro is, however, this difl-renco between tho present and all preceding similar occasions. By bitter experience and -by long continued depression, the conviction has been forced upon the community that the time has come when, without furthor parley or delay, some relief must in one way or another be obtained from the repressive legislation which for so long has been paralysing the people's ener- gies, and when thoso questions which are bo intimately connected with the progress of the colony must be dealt with. Instead of the ornamental in legislation, wo must have the material and the utilitarian, and if the Viceregal speech which today will be delivered does not clearly indicate that the Go- vernment means work and not play, a feeling of deep disappointment will bo experienced by tho whole com- munity. It is not difficult to point out those measures which it may fairly be expected will be promised in tho political mani- festo which His Excellency as the mouthpiece of his advisers will today enunciate. At a time when the Educa- tion Act is being attacked, and an agi- tation for the destruction of ono of its leading principles has been initiated, some reference to its operation will doubtless be made, and Parliament will expect to be informed as to the progress which has been effected in the erection of new schools, and the course the Ministry intend to adopt in order to meet the wants of thoso districts which have not yet been supplied with buildings adequate to the requirements of their respective populations. The Boyal commissions which have been appointed during the recess, for the purposes of inquiring into the working of the law relating to friendly societies, the constitution aud utility of our volunteer force, and to insure the due representation of Victoria at the Cen- tennial Exhibition to be held at Phila- delphia next year, will also require at least a brief notice. Then, in connexion with what may be termed our foreign relations, and remembering the speech of Mr. Casey at Echuca, it may be reason- ably anticipated that the Government will be able to inform bon. members that some attempt has been made towards Becuring the free interchange between the several Australian colonies of the products and manufactures of each. Indeed, we believe that negotia- tions on this subject aro now ponding with Tasmania. It has been rumoured that the Ministry intend again to re-introduce the Norwegian nostrum for the reform of our Constitution. We believe it is most unlikely that they will commit themselves to any proceeding which would at once be so insane, and bo fatal to their existence as a Government. At the same time, there is no doubt that some alteration in the relations of the two branches of the Legisla laturo to each other, and also in the representation of the people in Parliament, is urgently needed, aud these two cognate questions will probably occupy a prominent position in Ilia Ex- cellency's remarks. The question of taxation isone which the present Ministry, like all others, would, if it could, gladly leave untouched. It ia at all times a difficult matter to deal with, and just now it is perhaps besot with moro em- barrassing considerations than at any former period of the colony's history. Notwithstanding this, however, the in- cidence of the taxation of the colony is the question of tho session, and upon the manner in which it is dealt with, the existence of the Ministry, the pro- gress of the country, and the prosperity of the people will all depend. If the speeches delivered by various members of the Ministry during the recess moan anything, we shall be told to day that a number of tho customs duties which press heavily on the industry of the people will bo remitted, and that the necessary revenue will be raised in some other manner-iu fact, that a very material step in the direction of a return to sound fiscal principles will be proposed for the acceptance of Parliament. That an amending Land Bill will bo amongst the new measures promised may be considered certain. We suppose Mr. Casey will adhere to his pet project of increasing the maximum area of selection to GIO acres, but in face of the experience he has now had of the working of the Land Acts of 1805 and 18G9, ho will bo scarcely so infatuated as again to in- troduce the samo measure as the one last rejected by the Legislative Council, or ono similar to it. There must be a decided change in the manner of deal- ing with the Crown landa of the colony. The questions of state forests and timbor reserves will also demand considera- tion. A new railway bill will, as a matter of course, form part of the programme of the session ; but until the measure itself is introduced, very little will bo known of the intentions of the Ministry as to the details of the proposed exten- sions. The position of the Civil Ser- vice is and has for a long timo boon of a very unsatisfactory character, and wo believo that a bill amending the present act, and malring provision for tho estab- lishment of superannuation, life assur- ance, and fidelity funda will bo found in the list. Of course, the public aro already awaro that tho Ministry havo promised to present to Parliament again a bill dealing with tho vexed question of mining on private property, and the present depressed state of our mining industry renders it moro than evor necessary that this question should be speedily settled. Amongst tho other measures already promised by the Government may bo mentioned one for the establishment of a harbour trust, for the con- stitution of a marino board, for the amendment of the Wines, Beor, and Spirits Salo Statuto, for the amendment of the Police Ofi'oncea Statute, with the view of dealing more effectually with tho larrikin nuisance and tho dealers in marino stores, other measures relating to the administration of justice, and also one having for its object the establish- ment of councils of conciliation and of arbitration, for the purpose of settling differences between omployors and em- ployes. No doubt the Ministry will bo ablo to present a good programme ; it ro- mains to be seen whether, if they do so, thoy possess the courage and determina- tion to carry it out. On the ovo of a session which ought to bo fruitful of practical legislation, commensurate in value with the magni- tude of the intercBts which aro in peril, and corresponding in importanco with tho seriousness of the omorgoncy, wo must repeat, with increased emphasis, the admonition and expostulation which wo have addressed to the members of tho Legislature on previous occasions like tho present Nor can we hold ourselves excused from so doing by the fact that similar remonstrances Im e been formerly disregarded so soou is tho excitement of party conflict blinded the eyes of men Bitting on both sides of the Assembly to the paramount claims which the country has upon their time and attention, and ren dered them indifferent to every const deration but that of porsonal ambition and factious animosity Wo venturo to remind both Houses of Parliament, that they re assemblo under circumstances of unprecedented gravity, that the public mind is fully impressed with tho critical nature of the situation, and that this is no time to trifle with political affairs, and to convert deliberative chambers into an arena of strife Everybody feels and acknowledges that we have reached a turning point in the hiBtory of the colony, and that it depends to a very great extent upon the statesmanship of the present session whether there shall be what naturalists call " an arrest of development, ' or whether the community shall be rein stated in that path of progress from which wo have diverged into a kind of gloomy impasse If the members of the Legislative Assembly more particularly fail to comprehend the ßtate of public feeling, their m telhgence and discernment must be tery greatly at fault But if, recog nismg it, they deliberately sacrifice the interests of tho country to the intrigues and dissensions of party, and waste m wordy warfare the hours which should bo sedulously devoted to the transaction of public business, wo behove they will arouse a decree of indignation out of doors such as may relegate them to pmate life with a lasting stigma upon their reputation1' The questions which will have to be dealt with are not fancy questions, and cannot properly be made the pretext for dilatante discussion and political pugilism lhey touch the very found ations of the well being of large classes of the community-the mining, the agricultural, and the commercial They embrace the reconstruction of our fiscal system, the emancipation of industry from the trammols which are strangling it, the wise husbandry of what re mains to us of the public domain, the resuscitation of enterprise, and tho adoption of such measures as will not only check the outflow of popu htion and capital, but will enable us to emulate our neighbours in the healthy growth and Bteady expansion of the two great elements of national wealth Now, wo would ask members on both sides of the Assembly whether they intond to combine m an honest and he irty effort to legislate upon each and all of these for the good of the country exclusively, or whether they contemplate renewing the old discreditable stromlo for tho acci dents of place and power 1 Is the session to bo one of talk or of work 1 Aro Parlia- ments made for members, or aro mern bers elected with a view to qualify them moro effectually for the service of the whole body politic 1 Is office a respon sibility or a reward ? Is it an end or a means to an end 1 Are the functions of an Opposition to be exercised in a spirit of fair and intelligent criticism, of generous and honourable controversy, of courteous consideration for the men in power, and with a consistent and single minded regard for the general weal or have they no other object than to embarnss, to irritate, to undermine, and to intrigue against the Administra- tion for tho time being 1 Whatever may bo the answers which each membci of the Assembly will frame to these questions in his own mind, and whatever may bo the theories of con stitutional government by which ho has been in the habit of shaping his con duct heretofore, we must repeat that the time has now arrived when all personal and pirty considerations ought to bo strictly subordinated to tho one object-that of rescuing the colony from tho critical position m which it is admittedly placed Wo want men on both sides of the House to tgree in efiect to tho adoption of a " self " denying ordinance, m virtue of which they will forego Indulging in tho cus toniary flux of words and in the haoitual warfare of faction, and will apply themselves with all earnestness and sincerity to tho important work before them If they aro incapable of making this sacrifice, they will deserve some- thing more than tho public displeasure, and may provoke the execration of the whole community Wo hopo that Bomo of tho trustees of tho Public Library and its appurtonancos wcro eye witnossos of tho way in which tho picturo galloiy tho museum, and tho other parts of tho buildmg woro thronged yesterday byporsons who havo no other opportunities of \ ísiting thom than thoso winch prosont themselves on a public holiday lho scone undornoath tho portion resemblod tho outside of a theatre on boxing ni^ht and a continuous Btream of ordorly and intelligent Bpec tators pouied through tho edifico from the timo the gallones woi o oponed until tho unw olcoruo Bound of tho gong waa heaid at four o clock at which hour numbers of \ lBitors w oro obli^od to withdraw without havinj, fulfillod tho objoct for which thoy carno Noi can it bo doubted that if the building were opon on a Sunday after noon fi oiu ono to four or five, it w ould attract thousands of poraons who find it nupoBBiblo to roaorfc to it during tho wooli.

The premier tree was planted in front of the southern door of the Town-hall, in the street channel, which had been properly prepared for its reception. Eleven others were shortly afterwards planted along the same line, all fronting the Town-hall, and the mayor intimated that by the planting of these trees at his own expense, he considered he had performed his part of the planting of Collins-street, and it would now be for the property-owners to follow the example. The trees planted yesterday appear healthy, and likely to grow. In his remarks on the occa- sion, the mayor gave credit to various persons for their share in the movement, but he forgot to mention the real originator of street planting in Melbourne, viz., the Argus news- paper The Autumn Steeplechase Meeting of the Melbourne Hunt Club was held on the Hem ington course yesterday The Grand Stand and saddling i addock were well attended and there was a largo number of people on the flat but the hill-the best place on the course from which to seo a steeplechase was not very well patronised Ubo races passed oil very successfully the fields wero large and the events exciting enough In every race the favourites wero beaten The Hurdle Bice was won by Larrikin who was not mentioned in tho betting W 1 was second Mr Browns horse lo_t the raco through the jockey looking over bus right shoulder while Larrikin crept up unperceivoj on his left II irteen horsps Btarted for this race Dawn of Day won the Maiden Steeple chase after a good finish with Murrah 1 ive others started Seventeen horses started for the Handicap Flat Hace which was won by Onyx Break o Day and the Dane ran a dead heat for second place Tho Grand National Steeplechase was won by Prodigious who cantered home by himself Young Ballarat was second and Mobs third The victory of this horse was hailed with great cheers by the crowd on the flat Seven others started The day s sport was brought to a conclusion with the Selling Hurdle Race which was won by Ieacock the favourite Aaron being second Tho weather fortunately proved f ne and the racing was greatly enjoyed by the spectators It 1 as been decided by the council of the Victorian Rifle Association that the annual matches shall take place in the week end ing November 20 but this will of course depend upon whether they have any butts at which tho matches can be fired It has been proposed to fire at a neutral range but there is not Buch a ti ing to be found in the colony and the expense of preparing one would be far moro than the association conld stand At the same time if the Go vernment carry out their proposal to sell the I mentid 1 ill Butta after the 30th of Juno the association will have no ranges left thom at which the matches can tako place There can bo no doubt but that the sale of the ranges at Tmorald hill would materially weaken the volunteer forco as the shooting men would resign almost in a body It may bo stated that a petition has boon prepared for presentation to tho Volunteer Commission pointing out the damage that would be done to tho forco if these ranges wero abolished and tina petition will no doubt bo signed by every volunteer who has the opportunity of doing so The memorial stono of a new Presbyterian church on the Toorak road was laid yester day by Mr Bayles M LA.

signalling inasmuch as it is claimed for it that under moderately favourablo condi tions of the atmosphere message, may be transmitted with facility a distance of 50 miles The ínstiument consists of an adapta tion of and improvement on the heliotrope invented by Gauss the German mathomati enn in 1821 and the hehostat of Captain Diummond which was used with great sue cess m the triangulation of Great Britain The sematrope consists of a mirror tho re fleeting surface of which is an arc of _r> inches whoso versed Uno is 01 The object of this curve is to meet the difficulty anaing from the apparent motion of tho sun wl ich is constantly changing the direction of the reflected rays from the surface of the mirror Tho effect of thiB curve ia to dis perse the rayB to Buch an extent as will materially increaso tho length of timo during winch the flashes can be made without adjustment, and at the same timo with out reducing to any serious degree tie brilliancy of the light In order to prevent any vibratory movement and bo impair the correctness of the signals tho instrument is fixed on a hoavy cast iron base around the top of which, the mirror ia made to revolve Another feature peculiar to the instrument is the lens tube for dirooting the rays of light which has been so arranged as to work independently of the mirror A moveablo cover is also provided for the mirror by which

The spirit has been recognised as that of John W. Avery, the young man who was hanged in the gaol on June 28, 1872 for murder. The mysterious phenomena which accompany the appearance of the spirit were at first attributed to some plan of escape concocted by the pri- soners but recent developments prove that such is not the case. A prisoner named Wallace, who was confined in the gaol in October last and who was familiar with Avery, solemnly affirms that his spirit ap- peared one night and was distinctly seen to walk around one of the tiers and pull the bedclothing off a German prisoner who was confined in the cell formerly occu- pied by Avery. The German, who is still a prisoner, confirms the story, and many persons who visited Avery now remember that he made a solemn promise before his death to revisit the gaol after his execution. The story of his latest appearance seemed to be well authenticated, several of the prisoners thoroughly agreeing in their statement of all the alleged facts. The phenomenon occurred about midnight on Sunday and there is no doubt that the utmost consternation and alarm prevailed among the prisoners. As is customary in all well-regulated ghost stones, the clock had just ceased striking 12 when a soft unnatural light filled the whole interior of the gaol and awakened all the prisoners. Some of them were terror- stricken and buried their heads beneath the bed clothing, while others seemed to be paralysed so that they could not move and were thus compelled to be unwilling wit- nesses of the supernatural scenes and sounds that followed. They solemnly aver that they heard one of the windows raised and felt the cold air rush in. Then the shadowy form of a man all plainly visible except the legs, seemed to glide between the bars and up the stairs to the top tier of cells. The figure stopped in front of the cell which had been occupied by Avery and opening the door, entered. The open- ing and closing of the door were distinctly heard. After the lapse of a few minutes the figure reappeared and its footfalls on the steps as it descended again were distinctly heard. The figure passed around all the tiers of cells and then floated down to the wash- room, and was heard to turn on the water. Finally the ghost returned to the window and disappeared as it had entered, and the bluish light gradually faded away. This is substantially the story as told by several of the prisoners, who claim to have been eye- witnesses and express their firm belief that they saw Avery's ghost.
