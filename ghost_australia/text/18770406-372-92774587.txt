FARRELL'S PLAT. [From our own Correspondent.] i April 4; i There have been no amusements of any kind here during the holidays, as every one seemed to take a fancy to go either to the Burra races or the Manoora picnic. Those who went from here appeared to have thoroughly enjoyed themselves. There is some talk of getting up a cricket club, there being several good players here. I don't see why we should be behind the times in this respect. Messrs. Burton & Taylor's Circus passed through here this morning on their way to Clare, and the Band gave us a tune as they passed through the township, which was a i great deal more than Wilson's Hippodrome did. The great mastiff that was here guarding " a load of wood" was shot some short time ago, and since then I hear that it was in a paddock reducing a man's flock. Perhaps it was its ghost. Quite a gloom was cast over the town ship on Good Friday, as the news spread that the wife of one of our esteemed townsmen had departed this life. Since the late rains the grass has been growing rapidly, and in places there is good feed for cattle. The ground is so thoroughly soaked that the farmers cannot get on it to work. The weather is fine at present, but looks like rain to-day. The oats are growing fast on fallowed land.
