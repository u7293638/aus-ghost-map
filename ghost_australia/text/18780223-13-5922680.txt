PAPAL CONCLAVE. A conclave of cardinals having just elected a successor to Pius the Ninth, the following description which is extracted from a work entitled Pius the Ninth ; or, the First Year of his Pontificate, by Count C. A. de Goddes de Liancourt, of the Pontifical Academy of the Lincei at Rome, and James A. Manning, Esq., of the Inner Temple will be read with interest by all who are curious to learn the forms used in the election of a bishop to fill the chair of St. Peter The Conclave is the place where the cardinals assemble for the election of a Pope. The name is also given to the assembly of cardinals who are engaged in the election, who select the place which they think proper, the name not being applicable to any particular locality, although the Vatican, or palace of St. Peter, has for a long time been the chosen spot, and is in fact the best adapted for the purpose by reason of its grandeur and majesty, for the facility of guarding it from interruption, its courts and galleries, the grand square before the palace, and finally for the convenience of the position as regards the adoration of the Pope, a ceremony which is held there after the election and as the obsequiesofthePopetakeplaceiuthatchurch, it is much more convenient for the Cardinals to pass in procession from the church to the palace. Thus the consultation of the car- dinals as to the place of holding the conclave is a mere matter of form. In a large chamber of the Vatican are built as many coils as there are cardinals ; the cells are formed of deal planks, and each has a partition for the conclaves, persons appointed to wait upon the cardinals during the deliberation of the conclave. The cardinals draw lots for the cells, each cell having a corresponding number to that which, may be drawn, so that it frequently occurs that cardinals of different political sentiments are lodged in adjoining cells. There is a narrow passage between each call, when there are several in the same chamber or gallery, but the same precautions are observed when the cells are in separate chambers by means of a partition of planks, the open space serving for the conclavista. The cells remain during the nine days destined to the funeral obsequies of the deceased Pope, during which period the nobility and people of distinction visit the Conclave. The cells are all covered with green camlet or serge, with the exception of the belonging to the cardinals who were promoted by the deceased Pope, which are of a dark violet and on the door of each cell are the armorial bearings of its occupant. Between the cells and the windows of the Vatican there is a long gallery for the accommodation of the Conclave, and it is from this gallery that the cells receive lights The Conclave being time opened, the order of the Papal election proceeds as follows: It is known that the Popes are elected by a majority of two-thirds of the votes, excluding that of the candidate. The Sacred College, when complete, is composed of 70 Cardinals. 1. Six Cardinals, called Cardinal Bishops, or"Eniscopi Suburbicarii-that is to say, the Bishops of Velletri, Porto Santo Rufino, and Civita Vecchia, Friwcati, Albany, and Palestrina and Sabina. 2. Of 50 Cardinal Pricata, amongst whom are found a number of archbishops and bishops of all * The usual ceremonies are observed whether the Conclav to be held at the Vatican on the Quirinal. countries 3 Of 14 Cardinal Hears TI number of 70, however, is never complete filled up, there are sometimes from 54 CO Cardinals-there were 00 in October, 18 There is nothing to prevent the existence the greater number, but, habitually, the are never completed The Cardinal Dean the Sacred College is the chief of the Order Bishops The oldest Cardinal Priest is a chief of the Order of Priests The olde Cardinal Dean is the chief of the Order Deacons To judge rightly of the operation of a Cc leave, they begin by counting the number Cardinals whom health, ago, and distant may permit to join the Conclav e Then the try to discover where the Inclusive e will 1 and how they will be able to secure the t elusive The Inclusive comprehends the number Card in his from among whom it is intended choose the Pope The Exclusive comprehend a sufficient number of votes to prevent t Inclusive from being able to carry out i object, by deciding the choice Let us suppose that the Conclave is cor posed of 60 cardinals Two thirds of 60 ii 40 , if to these 40 we add one vote as that the candidate cannot be counted, the Inch sive in formed, and where there is no fear defection, the nomination is secure It Exclusive, in opposition, must be compos at least of the remaining third of the vote and to be sure of its calculation it should have one vote more, because 21 can prev e the other 39 from making any nomination The Italian Cardinals always form the cent of the Inclusive It is among them, according to their not unreasonable opinion, th the Pope should be found Experience proves that this course and th system are of very evident advantage to the Holy See Moreover, it appears that a great powers can organise this exclusive opposition party by forming it of the national cardinals, and the cardinals and their influence, or altogether free, and the finally who would not proceed immediately the expression of their sentiments Aft this it is necessary to avoid the convent once pointed out by Cardinal de Bernis, wl in a memorandum attached to a despatch a dressed to M de Vergonnes, under date October, 1771, said, "The inclusive linee eludes no one, and proposes whom it please;

The scrutator open this box, turn it over showing; the inside, and thus prove that it is entirely empty, then they look it, and return it to the in- farmers The cardinal dean first presents himself at the table, and, taking a schedule from the first basin, turns towards one of the other tables ranged round the chapel, writes his own name thereon, folds the voting paper, Benia it with the first and second impression, Writes the name of the elected, seals with the third and fourth impression, folds again, writes the number and the passage of Scripture which he has selected, and makes the final fold This operation is rapidly executed during the latter days of the Conclave, after it has been performed four times a day from the beginning of its session We should also observe that the masters of the ceremonies have previously prepared the papers with soft wax at the points, in the spaces C and E, which are to receive the impressions of the goals When they leave the chapel, and the ballot and decease have occupied a shorter time than usual, one cardinal will sometimes Bay to his neighbours, " Adcsso, taine practice' (Now we are getting; on) Each cardinal votes' according to his rank, that is to say, first, the cardinal bishops, then cardinal priests, and lastly, the cardinal deans, and when each has written his suffrage the decline takes his between two fingers only holds it up so that it may be seen by all, turns towards the altar, kneels, says a short prayer and, after rising, pronounces the oath, inscribed in large black letters on the table before the altar. The oath is as follows i Tcstor ChriBtum Domunim qui mo judi- catures est, eligero queen secundum Doum, judice digo debate at quod idem in access practise. it I call God, who will be my judge, to witness that I elect him whom I believe in God ought to be elected, which I will also be in the access The oath being pronounced, he lays the schedule on the patch of one of the chalices and returns to his place Immediately after, the deacons, the cardinals Infirmiere,] although their rank may not perhaps call them, take their suffrages to the altar, and go through the same ceremony Then they go out, that they may the sooner return with the suffrages of the side After the informer, each cardinal approaches the altar in the order of his rank, and deposits his vote Sometimes a cardinal who is present may be unable, from infirmity, to see- and go to the table to write his vote hold it in the air with two fingers, and bear it to the altar Is such a case the last drawn scrutator op proaches, presents him his prepared schedule, receives the written suffrage folded and sealed hears the oath, and returns with the schedule, when after raising it in the air, lia deposits it in the chalice, where it is united with the other votes The cardinals Infirmiere, who vote next after the deacons, having repaired to the cell of one of their infirm colleagues, present him, with a prepared schedule and a copy of the oath The sick cardinal writes, folds, and scalB his v orangeries, and with the assistance of the Infirmiere who must always be present, he goes through the same form as the cardinals in the chapel have previously observed If it should happen that a sick cardinal cannot write, he 13 perin tied to borrow the aid of another at his choice, the chosen Party pledging himself religiously to keep the secret of the vote The box being brought back to the ch reel, is opened by the agitators, who ascertain that there are as many votes as there are infirm cardinals This recognition made, the place the schedules of the infirm one by one in the chalice the lust cardinal scrutator then shake the votes in the chalice covered with the patents and draws them out one after the other counting them in order to place these in the second chance If the number of the schedules should not correspond with the number of the cardinals voting, all the papers are immediately burned without further ceremony At the election of Leo XII , some days after the opening of the Conclave, 49 cardinals were present, of course 49 schedules should have been found If the number of schedules equal that of the voters the opening of the scrutiny proceeds The first Scrutator draws a paper from the chalice, opens it at the middle by breaking the seals C to uncover the space D, where the name of the elected is written , reads the name to himself, and takes a note of it passes the paper thus opened to the second scrutator, who also takes down the name It is only the third scrutator who pronounces the name aloud at the same moment every cardinal, being provided beforehand with a printed sheet containing the names of all the caidmalscomposing the Sacred College, absent or present, without exception, marks, as the name is pronounced, the vote he has obtained The opening of every schedule drawn from the second chalice is accompanied and followed by the same formalities is the first If it should happen in opening the ballot that the first scrutator should find two notes folded together and united in the middle in such a way that it may be presumed, they both belonged to one voter, they are considered only as one Suffrage when they are both in favour of the same person , but if they contain two distinct names, the votes are both null and did 1 his discovery does not affect the rest of the ballot, which is as regular as if the circumstance of the two sisters had not occurred As soon as the act scrutator has read a schedule aloud, ho threads it with a bottle filled with silk thread by the space D, where the word Lligo is printed, knots the two ends of the thread, deposits the packet in the second. golden chalice, winds received the first votes, on the table before the altar If in the first publication a number of votes in favour of any one person be equal to two thirds of the number of cardinals present at the conclave the Pope is canonically elected In that case all is concluded, by an exact verification of the schedules by each of the agitators who test the seals, number, and device, so that by another for. quality, which is described below, the election is completed If one name does not obtain two-thirds of the votes, the Conclave passes to the access, a ceremony which is resorted to whenever the ballot leads to no definite result When the access is announced, every cardinal immediately proceeds to take from the second basin one of the district schedules prepared for the access, in which the word accede is substituted for ch g I elect ) In other respects the form of the votes is the same as in the scrutiny, and presents the same subdivisions At the end of the words Accede Rovcrendis simo Dom mee D Cardinals, the elector writes the name of the cardinal to whom he accedes, taking care to name some other than the one he chose at the scrutiny, which is of strict obligation, and to abstain, also from naming any cardinal who has not at least had one vote before the access If the voter absolutely desires to have no other elected than he to whom he has already given his suffrage, he adds to the world accede that of nerves- I accede to no one, and fold his billet as in the former case It is evident that the accused is a sort of balloting in another form , all that is practised before in the regular ballot, and the declaration of the scrutiny, the visits to the infirm, We. are repeated in the access, except the oat li, which, is not renewed The Schedules being drawn from the cha- lice, the t notes of the access being noted and. published, as before observed, the suffrages given by the two votes are counted and. Brought together for each candidate If the votes of the scrutiny, united to those of the accesso, in f a our of one cardinal be equal in number to two thirds, then the first scrutator, under the inspection of his colleagues, examines the validity of the schedule of the access '1 along the threaded packet of the scrutiny, he tests the souls, the numbers and the devices of the schedules that it contains, and their identity IS acknowledged by him He then passes the paper to the second scrutator, who does the same, and then the third scrutator commences the third verification The name of the elected also forms the subject of a rigorous examination, especially if there be two cardinals of the same name-two Barberini, two Borghese, two Ruffo, two Dona, etc The etc is well if it be applied both in the scrutiny and the access to the same person , if it be different, and consequently available, the third Scrutator proclaims aloud the name of the elected, and declares the seal, the number, and the dev ice of each elector He then registers his decoration They then proceed to the enumeration of the suffrage by the two modes, that of the RC? tiny and that of the access If the same cardinal has not obtained in the United votes the number prescribed, that is, two thirds, exclusive of his own, all that has been done is considered as nothing, and the work of election begins over again, but if the examination of the scrutiny and the access together gives the two thirds without the vote of the elected, then the Pope is elected, and the election is canonically effected In this case three cardinal deacons, chosen by lot, are immediately invested with the functions of recognition or revisers, and it devolves upon them finally to verify the operation of the scrutator Every thing being found regular, the election is announced and the schedules are all burnt, as they were after the scrutiny and at the access when the number had not been in favour of any candidate Immediately after an acknowledged election the youngest of the cardinal deacons rings a bell to summon the masters of ceremonies and the secretary of the sacred college The chapel is closed The cardinal deacons and the cardinal chamberlain-if neither of them be the Pope elect-advance together towards the cardinal named, who for a long period has always been one of the cardinals present at the conclave, and they ask if he accepts his election 1 raneo, Spaiii,andAuBtria,indopondontlyof their calculations of the exclusive and inclusive, claim a distinct right of veto apart, that is, M hero the votes appear to be directed towards a candidate who is not agreeable to one of these courts, each of them exercises the right to exclude a candidate, but one only, who may be near having two thirds of the required votes, provided always that the vote be put in before he is absolutely elected The veto IS pronounced upon a probability which appears well founded, and tobodroadod, aiiduotupon a certainty The exclusion of the sort, which at Rome is not considered as a positive right, being once employed by one of the above e named powers, that power must accept the choice which follows, unless another privileged court should also give in its exclusion , but then the latter may sometimes be found to bear upon a candidate not objectionable to the other two courts It is seldom that the motives of objection are identical in the three courts It may be remarked that, although the custom prevails, the right of exclusion is strongly contested at Some RECENT sounding operations show that the mean depth of the Atlantic is about 2,000 fathoms An elevated ridge, with a mean depth below the surface of 1,000 fathoms traverses the basin of the North and South.
