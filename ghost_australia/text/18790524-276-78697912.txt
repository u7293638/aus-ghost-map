THE ABORIGINES, It has been asserted in various rppent works on Australia that prior to the ad vent of Europeans the aborigine of' this continent had no idea of a future state of existence, nor indeed of anything beyond their immediate wants; and that they lived and died like the inferior animals. But how these writers discovered the un belief or ignorance of the inferior animals on the subject is an enigma, because it has been clearly shown that homes, dogs, and elephants have a dread of travelling at night, and often mistake indistinct ob- jects for spectres, flying from them in the utmost terror. When Buckley trusted himself to the tender mercies of naked savages in preference to those of his coun- trymen in Australia Felix -- whatever that means - he accedentally sat on a deceased hero's grave, where the aborigines found him, and at once believed that he was their long lost king " jumped up" again; and full of that belief they prostrated themselves before him in the attitude of adoration. Dutton at Portland men- tioned that it was fortunate for the pioneers that the blackfellows were frightened of ghosts and would not ven- ture out at night; and when Morton and Laurie were speared while getting stringy bark at the place now called Dunrobin. Cookc, the hutkeeper, who had charge of the homestead, lighted up a death's head lantern which he kept for the purpose, at sight of which two lubras, who had been sent to reconnoitre, fled in the utmost, terror and probably intimated to the others that the dead were rising from their graves, for they all fled precipi- tately. The late Edward Henty, who was very far from being popular with the aborigines, who were by every law, human or divine the rightful owners of his principality, once asked them why, they placed their dead in the trees when one of them at once replied that it was "to be near the clouds." And why wish to be near the clouds unless they believed that their fathers were there? I have noticed that they viewed "Coke upon Lyttleton" with contempt, and looked upon the judges as of kind of harle- quin, injuring them doubtless by their dress; but as soon as they entered a place of worship, no matter whether it was Roman Catholic or Presbyterian-new light or old light-they at once became serious.
