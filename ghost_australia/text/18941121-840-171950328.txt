a remarkable family. The most, remarknblo family that Alabama ever- produced was the Knight family, .who lived three miles from St-. Stephen's. John Knight was tho father of twenty-eight children. Ho was a fine specimen of physical manhood. He stood Oft. 7in. in his stookiug feet, and his voice was like that of -the lion's roar. His wife, tiie mother of those twenty-oight children, wns less than five foot in height, and weighed about 1001b. Standing side by sftlo her head scarcely reached his vest pocket. They were both industrious, and whoa thoir children got old enough to talk thoy were put to work. ' Tliero ivas no loiifing or indolence tolerated on tho Knight plantation. Everyone had to rise with tho dawn- of day. There woro oighteen boys, and ton girls, Tlio males inherited their father's physical prowess, tlio females their mother's diminutive size. Lord Fitziiardinoe, better known as Sir Maurice Berkeley, was, like his prede cessors, a devoted champion of tho hunting- field. In addition to being a capital rider ho .was a thoroughly practical man as a sports man, and in breeding hounds entertained tiie eame views as the previous earl, who did not fanoy any dog-hound above twenty- three inches, and cared more about the .work, they got through than their sym metry. ''' ' " I don't, care' for all their; looks/" he went on : ' to say ; " huntsmen ' forget to brood hounds for their nosesâ€” they're all for ioolce. . Give me the pack that vlll kill foxes." " Did you ever see a ghost?"- . . / 1 " Once." ... ." Were you ecared ?" ' "i\Vos I ecared? Was- 1? My false '.teeth were in d glass 'on . a. table 'three' feet ttWay from , the bed, and., tliey, actually, rattled eo lond tliab thoy:-.woko tbo neigh- 'hours."
