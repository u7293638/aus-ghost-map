THE LITERATURE OF THE COMMONWEALTH. The following is an "extra ' lecture de liv erect, at special request, l Professor Jean s before the members of the Brighton centre, in connection with the University) extension movement, on Tuesday), December 8 - In the brilliant crowd of writers whose works adorn the Commonwealth period, I seem to distinguish three irreconcilable and, in a certain sense, antagonistic groups I do not mean to say that there was during these years an formal partisanship of one school against another In fact, the great and memorable word battles of that age were fought as a rule, between men who belonged to the same camps They were duels rather than pitched battles There was so much in common between Selden andGrotius, between Prince and Lilburn, and even between Stilton and balmains, that at first blush we wonder why) these fierce con- troveraiahsts chose not rather their opponents from among men whose minds were of alien race Perhaps because the quarry 1 bet i en them and these antagonists had passed beyond the region of words 'He chasm lies too deep and wide to be bridged by the elastic chains of verbal argument. Ihm fact makes our task of analysing the easier In the first or Ro) first group of writers, I e notice certain obvious characteristics Their works are, for the most part, marked by the lightness and grace too often also by the licentiousness of the late Italian Renaissance That peculiar kind of hypocrisy), which consists in feigning one's self to be worse than one really is, seems to have been a decided feature of the loyalist must Now ada) is such a fault is usually the result of coxcomb), often of cowardly cox come , then it was probably produced by an extreme dread of falling into the opposite vice The CavalierS loose tongue was his budge of defiance to the Puritan s Scupturul cony ersation Needless to say that the Puritan appreciated the offence and abhorred the offender Shakepeare hall long before proved that YY Ives may be merry and yet honest too and Heinck wrote, as the epitaph upon his work " Joound his Muso was, but his Life was chaste But the Puritan did not believe in this explanation And indeed it is harder to imagine any thing more dismally and deliberate)} disgraceful than much of the work of Do den (for example), who, so far as his other actions were concerned was a temperate and decent lix er With Dr) den, however, we are passing into a later stage Putting aside this old yous and undeniable defect there is much for us to admire in the work of the Royalist writers Perhaps it is mainly in the form, but then this is one of the rare qualities of English literature M here, except with the giants of English literature, shall we find the equals of the limpid and delicate lines of clientele, the crystalline clearness of Waltons faultless prose, and the clean, sharp strokes of ITobbes logical scythes Look at Herrick for a moment He does not profess to be concerned with deep pro blend " I sing of brooks of blossoms birds and bowen, Of April Ma), of June and July flowers I sing of Ma) poles, hock carts was sails wakes Of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal cakes " I sing of times trans shifting, and I write Iloyy roses first came red and lilies white I write of groves of twilight, and 1 sine; The Court of Mab and of the fairy time, And there is an almost studied absence of Solemnity from this verse which quite bears out the promise of his prologue Herrick is a poet to read on summer afternoons, in hay fields under broad spreading trees, in old fashioned gardens of hollyhocks and mignonette, in lazy barges on mid stream This is the enjo) mg faculty, which does not ask whence and why came the good things of earth, the innocent, simple pleasures of country life, but which takes those good lungs and makes them its own 11 Gather ye rosebuds while ye may Old Time is still rallying, And this same flower that smiles to-day To morrow will be dying And again "Praise the) that will, times past I Joy to see Myself now live, this age best pleases me Accordingly we look for the perfection of Herrick in his lightest and most fanciful moods those moods which have given us the Cherry Ripe and the Night Piece I quote the latter as the less known - " Her eyes the glow we can lend them, the shooting stars attend thee And the elves also YY those little eyes glow I like the sparks of fire befriend thee N "No will of th wlspiiifs]lt,httlicc Nor snake orsova yy one bite thee Huon on thy way Not making a stay, Since ghost there is none to affright thee "I not the dark thee number VA that though the moon does slumber ? the stars of the night YY Will lend thee their light Like tapers clear without number But every now and again we get a half eimeo!, half kindly recognition or the sadder side of life, often in a little two line epigram, that sticks in the softer material of Herrick s poetry like a them in a pencil " Man may want land to live on but for all Nature finds out some place for burial Or again "I at others to the printing press run fast, Since after death comes glor), 111 not haste Still we must look away from Herrick: for the real solemn thunder in all this tempest of Cay aller brilliance, beyond even the professedly sacred poets, George Herbert and Henry Vaughan (2 Silunst to the Soldier poets Montrose and Lovelace We have heard of Montrose before, have seen his dashing campaigns in the Highlands, and watched him lull before his cruel enemy at Edinburgh Are we surprised to find him the author of the immortal lines 1 He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, That dares not put it to the touch, To gain or lose it all " And Loy place, the careless, need), reckless adventurer What a bolt he sometimes sends from his sunny blue 'Stone walls do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage Minds innocent and quiet take That for a hermitage If I have freedom in my love, And in my soul am free, Angels alone that soar above, Lnjo) snell liberty And then the supreme, unalterable couplet " I could not let of thee Dear, so much, Loved I not Honour more Cavalier prose finds its ideal in the matchless traditions of Izaak Walton, one of the most honourable and consistent, if not the most conspicuous supporters of the Royal cause That cause appealed to him on far more rational grounds than to half its more noisy champions He could understand and ap. restate the learning, wisdom, and kindly ness of the Potter Anglican prelates Though himself a townsman, he loved the cryStalline contentment of the old rural order and he saw that the spirit of the Puritans would lead to its overthrow 'J he restless energy of Puritanism abhorred the quiet of the country Walton s days were almost the last in which country life was accounted genuine!) better than town life by the majority of Englishmen Walton was genuine in his love of it, but even his contemporaries, Herrick and Cowley, strike an artificial note in their praises of rural felicity With them we pass into the region of Celia's and I'll) Mines there is a foretaste of Watteau about their landscapes and shepherdesses In the new age, of course, Hampshire was as Kamschatka But Walton is the genuine metal simple, direct, without effort " And let me tell you, this kind of fishing with a dead rod and la) Ing night books are like putting in one) house, forth both by ask for the on fire when they do nothing but sleep or eat, or rejoice as you know we have done till this hour and sat as quietly and as free from cares under this s) camera as Y irgll 8 Till he and his Meliboeus did under their broad beech tree No life, my honest Kcholar no life so hopes) and pleasant as the life of a well governed angler for when the lawyer is swallowed up with business and the statesman is preventing or con arly lug plots then we sit on cowslip banks hear the birds sing and possess ourselves In as much quietness as these silent silver streams which we now see glide required) by us.

learned man, and his books furnish an admirable guide to the less familiar literature of his own and earlier days Judged as a whole, the more ambitious performances of the Cavalier waters are not

severe Cavalier literature are Hobbes s Leuathanani Clarendon's History of the Great Rebellion The former is a systematic treatise on diphtheria philosophy) acute, consistent, forcible It is remarkable, among other things, for the bold and successful way in vi Inch it takes what was even then the favourite political dogma of the Park, mentarian miners - the hypothesis of a social compact and makes it result in the purest absolutism The Leviathan is not much read now in its original form, but it has powerfully influenced the speculations of this century through the medium of its modern expositor, Aubtms treatise on Jurisprudence Of Clarendon s great work I have not time to speak Suffice it to say that, whilst invaluable to the trained historian, it is a most dangerous guide for the last) As olding the grosser abuses of partisanship, Clarendon does not scruple to gloss, and, like Dr Johnson in later times, takes care that " the Whig dogs shall not have the best of it Perhaps its most interesting feature is the brilliant and Btaltly succession of portraits, especially those of prominent loyalists, which passes before our eyes the eye turn the pages If the note of the first of

easy with SaLmaSius Oh I it is enough to make the angels weep to think that lips which framed the pure and pathetic lines on the poet's blindness should be denied with a words like those " How art thou fall in from Henry n, O Lucifer? son of the morning, But, perhaps, the severest criticism upon Milton's partisanship is to place by the side of his finest work the masterpiece of a poet who was incomparably his inferior in powers of mind, but who, at least in this case, refused to lend his aid to the service of his own opinions James Shirley lived barely a generation before Milton, and he wrote " The glories of our blood and state Are shadows not substantial things There is no armour against fate Death lays his icy hand on kings Sceptre and crown Must tumble down, And in the dust he

deductions for controversialist, as well as for the pedantic display of learning which disfigures the works of all but the greatest of the Puritan as rivers and which niaéleroiigh old Hobbes say that if he read as much as other men he should be as ignorant as the), there remains a solid residuum of pure metal to say nothing of the stately splendours of Milton s great epics, we have 111 his minor

able Speaking of the influence of our natural chamois in upon our dreams, He saw 8, " A man might have lived all his life upon the sleeping limit of Antonius ' But I will go further than this, and declare that the author of the Religio Medici, if he errs in self misrepresentation with the Cavalier, sometimes attains a dignity which the fathers of the bulky Puritan folios (" there were giants in the earth in those days') safely reached Especially) does he manifest this quality in speaking of the approach of death " " I thank God that I have not those straight liga ments, or narrow obligations to the world as to dote on life, or he cony used and tremble at the name of death Not that I am insensible of the dread and horror Ulomo! or have forgot the apprehension of mortality but that, marshalling all the horrors and contemplating the extremities thereof, I find not any thing therein able to daunt the courage of a man, much less a wolf resolved Christian and therefore am not angry
