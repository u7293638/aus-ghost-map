SMISS OR I nMRS. CHAPti'TER VIIn- Cninlt'n Tlio gwta 'eked to dinner began to arrive. Indy Wiowood was recalled to her duities as mistress of the hoio. It was a pleasant little dinner-with ono drawback. It began too late. The ladies only reached the small drawing-room at tenominates to toeu.. In'unco wa only 'able to" join tlom'eh the clock stranck. -.:. "-t S'Too Intel' whispered Natalie. 'Ho will'bo here directly.' 'Nobody comes punctually to an evening party,' said launce.. 'Don't let nous lose a moment. Send me for Natalie opened lier lips to say the necessary words. Before she could speak, the servant announced-' Mr. Turlington.' " Ho clmo in, with his stiffly-uprig3bt shirt'collier n~d loosely-fitting glossy. black clothes He made his sullen and clumsy bow to Lady Winwod. - And then he did; what he had done dozens of times already-ho caught Natalio, with hoer eyes still bright and lier face still animated (after talking to,Launce)-a striking contrast to the cold anol unimpulsive young Jlady whom;he: wps accustomed to see while Natalie.'as talkingi to hifm. Lady Winwood's daughters were .poersons of some celebrity in the world of amateur music. ' Noticing the look that Turlington- cast at launce, Lady Winwood whispered to Miss : Lavlnia-who instantly. asked thel yoinggladies to sing. 'Inunce, in obedience to:aesign from Natalie; volunteered to find the music.books.' It is needless to add that he pitched on the wrong volume at starting. As he lifted it from the piano to take it lack to the stand, there dropped out from between the leaves a printed lotter, looking like a circular. One of the .young lIdies: took it up, and ran her eye over it, with a start.. ' The Sacred Concerts I' ashe exclaimed. ,Her two sisters, standing by, looked at acha other guiltily: ' What will the committee say to us ? We entirely forgot the meeting last month.' ' Is there a meeting this month I' They all looked anxiously at the printed letter. SYes I tihe 23rd of December. Put it down in your book, Amelia.' Amelia, then and there, put it down among tie engagements for the latter end of the'moitlh. And- N?atlio's unacknowledged husband placidly looked on. i'So did the., merciless: irony; of circumstances make Launes the innocent means of exposing his own secret to discovery.: Thanks to his success in laying his hand on the wrong music-book, themre would now be a meeting two good days before the elopement could take place between the lord's daughters and the rector's wife I SThoe guests of the evening began to appear in twos and threes. The gentlemen below stairs left the dinner table, and joined them. The small drawing.room was pleasantly filled, and no more. Sir Joseph Graybrooke, taking Turlington's hand,: ld him eagerly to their host. The talk in the drawing-roomlbad turned on finance. Lord Winwood was not'quite satisfied with some of his foreign invest monts; anod Sir Joseph's'dear Richard' was the very man to gire him a little sound advice. The three laid their heads together in a corner. Launco (watching them) slily pressed Natalie's hand. A renowned 'vir tueso' had arrived, and'was thundering on the piano. 'The attention of the guests generally a?s absorbed in tihe performance; A fairer.chanoo of sending Launco for the fan could not possibly have, offered, itself. While the financial discussion was still proceeding, the married lovers were ensconced together, alono in the boudoir. Lady Winwrood (privately observant of their absence), kept her eye on the corner, watching Richard Turlington. IHe was talking earnestly- with his back towards the company. IHe neither mnoved nor looked round. It caemo to Lord Winwood's tui~i to speak. Ho preserved tie smeo position, listeuing. Sir Joseph took up tlho conversation next. . Then his attention wandered--he know beforehnnd what Sir Joseph wouild's'y. His eyes turned anxiously towards the place in which lie left Natalie. Lord Winwood said a word. His head turned back again towards the corner. Sir Joseph put in an objection. : .He glanced once more over his saboulder this time, at the place in which Launee had been stand. lug.-- Tim next moment his host reoalled his attention, and made it impossiblo for him to continue his scrutiny of .tleroom;, At the same time, two amongthoe vening guests, bound for another party, approached to take leave of the lady of the house. Lady Winwood swas obliged to rise, and attend to them. They had sonie; thling to sayto her before they left, and they said it 'at terrible length ; standing so as to intercept her view.of the proceedings of the enemy. When she had got rid of them at last,.sheo looked-and behold Lord Winwood and Sir Joseph were the only occupants of the corner I ' Delaying one moment, to set thei ' virtuoso' thunder ing once more, Lady Winwood slipped out of the room, and crossed the landing. At the entrance to the empty drani'ng-room she heard Turlington's voice, low and threatening, in the boudoir. . Jealousy has a' second sight ofits own. He had looked in thoe right place at starting-and, oh hoavehs IEhoe had caught them. -'Her ladyship's courage was heyond dispute; but she turned pale, as she approached the entrance to the boudoir. i There stood Natalie-at once angry. and afraid -bo. tween,tho man to whom she was ostensibly engaged, and the man to whom she was actually married. Turling ton's rugged face expressed a martyrdom of suppressed fury. Launce-in the act of offering Natalie her fan smiled, with the cool supaliority of a man who knew that he had woe his advantage, and who tiiumphed: in knowing it. : .f I forbid you to take your fan from that man's hands,' said Turlington, speaking to Natalie, and pointing' to oaune.. 1 . . ' '- Isn't'it rather too soon to begin forhbiddia "" eacd Lady Winwood, good-humorodly. ' '.Exactly what I ayl'.exclaimed Launce. ' It seems necessary to remind lMr. Turliogton that bhois not mar ried to Natalie yet I' S These last wolds were spoken in a tone -which 'made bothltho women tremble inwardly for results. Lady Winwodd toolk the fan from LaInes with one hand, and took Natalie's arm with the'other. 'There is your fan, my dear,' she said, in liher easy, off-hand manner. . 'Why. do you allow those two bar barous men to keep you herio'whilo the-great Dootmann is" playing:the Nightmare Sonata in the next room I Innce I l Mr. Turlington I follow, me, and learn to be musical directly I - You:lavo onlyto' shut your eyes, and you will fancy you 'hear four mmlorn German composers playiring, instead of one, and not-the ghost of a melody among all theofour.' . - " She led the way out with Natalie,: and' whispered, 'Did hbe catch you?'' Nntali whiaspered hck,':! I heard him in time. He only caught us looking for the fan.' Thit two men waited behind to have two words :to. gethobr, hlono in'the houdoir.

After the usual preliminary phrases had been ex 1 changed, Sir Joseph shou'ed some hesitation in openly. approaching the question,whioh the.little party of three lhad mot to debate. , He avoided his lawyers eye; and ho looked at Turlington rather uneasily, "' " 'hichard,' he began at last, "whoa' I spokoto you.

Even his. lenly nerves began to feel the long strain of suspicion that had been laid unremittingly on them for weeks past. Hiis power of self control--hlo knew it himself-was not to be relied on.
