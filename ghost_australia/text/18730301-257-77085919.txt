The procession slowly wended its way along the centre of the majestic build ing, entering tlie choir by the west dour.

His lord ship took a sent iu frout of the Holy Table, fac ing the congregation. The hymn ended, the vice-dean (Archdeacon Jacob) stepped forward, and, in a very audible voice, presented thodcan elect to the bishop in the following (onus : — 'Higutltev. 1'iither iu God, 1 present unto you this godly and well-learned man, our Brother in Christ, John Braniston, B.I)., to be admitted and instituted to the office and dignity of dean of this Cathedral Church.'

The oath of allegiance and du-- obedience to the bishop was then administered to tlic clunn- j elect by the Rev. B.

He further declared that he hud not by himself nor by any other person acting on his behalf made any payment, coutract, or promise nf any kind whatsoever, which to the best of his know ledge or belief was simoniacal. touching his ob taining of the preferment to tlie deanery of the cathedral church of Winchester, nor would he lureifter perform or satisfy, in whole or in part, any such kind of payment, cmtract, or promise made by any other person without his knowledge or consent. He declared that he would be faith ful and bear true allegiance to her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs, and successors according to law, and that he would pay true and canonical obedience to the Lord Bishop of Winchester and his successors in all things lawful and honest. 'So help me God.'' His lordship then delivered, in a moit solemn manner, an address, which was as follows: — 'Itev.

Soon the voice of prayer shall rise from this congregation for thee, and that pi aver will specially implore God's grace fur thee for the three special purposes iu thy oflice of dean in this cathedral. The first of these purposes is that thou niayest hove grace to maintain the pure and true wership of God nithin this building according to thy office — true in the doctrine of His holy church, true in the offering of hearts touched by the Spirit of the Lord, and rising to him in daily supplication and in praise from this cenlre of our diocese ; secondly, that prayer shall be offered for thee that thou mayest be seen among.-t us showing that divine light in thine own soul for the main tenance of which in others this cathedral hath been endowed— that thou niayest give, thy mind and will, thy thought and prayer, to grow in the grace of God and iu all the studies ot a holy life ; and, thirdly, the prayer will ascend for thee that ' thou niayest be amongst us au example upon which our eyes, can be lixed— that we may follow thee as thou dost follow Christ, in all humility of \ mind, in this thy high office, preserving amongst j thy brethren here thy rule with tenderness, and ' mercy, and love, iu the fear of God, and in the ! spirit of the Lord Jesus, that so, setting before us the example of the new life, thou mayest kindle in many u desire to attain thereunto, showing thyself kind to those in need, merciful to thosein trouble, hospitable tothosc about thee, and to be a ruaintaincr of the truth of Christ, an cxaltcr of His worship, ft follower cjf His steps. 0 may God give thee grace to live amongst us, and, when His will is, to die amongst uSj^yit we may praise His name that in thee tt^Bs given us one to help us onward in the -^^pa serve Him who died for our redeinption/^rod the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost nccept this day the offering of thyself to make thee meet to do Him service. Amen.' The dean-elect then entered within the com muuion rails, knelt down before the bishop, took the seal in Ins right hand, and was instituted iu the prescribed form. The letters patent were dated Westminister, the 22ud of November, in the 36tb year of her Majesty's reign, and vested the dean-elect with all and singular the rights, profits, privileges, and appurtenances belonging to the deanery, iu succession to Dean Gamier, the last dean, resigned under the Dean and Canons' Resignation Act, and the bishopassigned him a stall iu the Chapter House of the Cathe dral for the term of his natural life under the said letters patent and statutes and ordinances of the cathedral chinch, ' the same as had been hitherto assigned, saving always to ourselves our episcopal right, and tlie dignity and honor of the cathedral church of Winchester. In testi mony whereof we have caused our episcopal seal to be hereunto Attached on this 20th day of November, 1872, and in the year of our transla tion the third.' The bishop's mandate for installation wasthen delivered to the new dean for presentation to the vice-dean, who, with the Rev. Canon Cards and the dean-elect, retired to the Chapter-room. The bishop was then conducted to his throne, the vice-dean and canons to their stalls, and di vine service commenced, Dr. Arnold (who pre sided at the organ) playing a voluntary in the meantime. The service was intoned by tbe Rev. Precentor Wray, and the absolution was read by tbe bishop from tbe throne. The. first lesson was«ad by tbo Rev. G.

After the singing mid prayer, the dean was led by the vice-dean to his decanal stall, where the prayers (in Latin) prescribed by the Cathedral statutes were offered by the vice dcan.iind of which thefollowiugisatranslation:— ' Have compassion, we beseech thee, O Lord God, upon thy servant, John Brainston, design ated to the presiding office of dean of this church.

May he faithfully serve Thee, and do Thou direct him into the way nf eternal salvation, through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. A men.' | It will be seen, in accordance with the bishop's intimation iu his adress, that the three tonics of that address form the leading petitions in the above prayer]. Divine service then proceeded to its close, the second lesson being read by Archdeacon Jacob. The service was Goss's in 12, and the anthem Goss's composition 'Praise the Lord,' taken from Psalm exxv.
