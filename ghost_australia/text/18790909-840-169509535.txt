THE DISCOVERT OF A DEAD INFANT. The inquiry into the circumstances attending the death of the male infant whose body was found on the Milton road a few days ago, was continued yesterday. The evidence of Dr. Hobbs was to the effect that he had made a post-mortem examination of the remains on the 5th. instant. He had found the stomach to be in its natural infantile state, but on removing the integuments ments of the scalp ho found the frontal bones pushed under the parietal bones, and between the integuments and the frontal bones there was a large extravasation of blood, which, in his opinion had been caused by a blow on the forehead , which blow had been the cause of death. There was a slight mark on the centre of the forehead, which must have been caused by a blow. No other marks were visible on the body, but he was quite satisfied that the child had been born alive, and that death had been caused by violence. Sarah Jane Perks deposed to having discovered the body on Thursday. the 4th instant. lying under a bush near the Milton road, about half-way between Brisbane and Toowong. She was driving in a buggy in company with Mrs, Aitken and Mr. Anderson when she saw the body. The evidence of Lucy Aitken was corroborative of that of the last witness. The inquiry was adjourned until to-morrow. _____________________________________ Volunteer Examinations. — The following officers and candidates for promotion have presented themselves for examination to the boards of examiners for the Artillery and Infantry : — Captains Webb, Bernard, Newman, Mein, and Skinner ; Lieutenants J.

' ______________________________________ Our Dirty Ways. —Now that the new telegraph building is fully completed it is not too much too expect that steps should be at once taken to put the pathway in front of it in a passable state. At present the least shower of rain turns it into a sea of mud, which passengers are, but too glad to avoid by taking refuge in the comparative cleanliness of the roadway. In William-street, too, there is another shocking bit of pathway, on which three public buildings “give” — the Treasury, Government Lithographic Department and the Colonial Secretary's Office. This is a very bad example to set before private property holders. ____________________________________ The Children's Hosmtal. — A party of amateurs calling themselves the ' Mammoth Christy Minstrels ' gave an entertainment at the old School of Arts last night in aid of the funds of the Children's Hospital. The hall was crowded, and the fund’s of the hospital will receive a substantial addition. The pro. gramme embraced the songs, dances, and bits of fun incidental to nigger entertainments, and each item was very well executed, some of the songs being admirably rendered. The corner men succeeded in getting many a laujft out of the audience. Amongst the songs given were ' Kiss me to sleep ' and ' Sweet chiming bells,1' whioh are well worthy of notice, and which were greatly appreciated. Two farces ocenrrod at the end , of tho entertainment. That entitled 'M'Guffin's, Ghost' was well played, but owing to .its stalenees did .not Beem to 'take;' and. the ; other, 'The Dra matic Agenoy,' fully deserved its designation of 'screaming.' ; . _____________________________________ The Weather. — The weather continued showery at.
