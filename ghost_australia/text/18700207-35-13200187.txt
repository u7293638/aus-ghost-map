A fLIGHT FOR LIFE. .*_Si.Non," he said, " I have found your man ; he is hidden in the Mulbacen. From all I can discover he leaves Granada in a day or two never to return. He intends, we are told, to sail over to Africa. Now, therefore, is your time, or never. You can have two of my men BE guides, and my best mules or horses for your expedition. But you had best set out to-night." I thanked him with all my heart, and mine lately got ready. I borrowed a pair of pistols and a Jagger, of finest, keenest steel, from Bermudez, and wrapping myself up in a large cloak I started with my companion for the bandits' quarters. We reached them about nine o'clock, and Bermudez added to the scout, who had discovered the retreat of Balthasar, our old friend Julian Romea, who willingly joined me in my holy expedition. They put up a quantity of provisions, and we proceeded on our way at midnight. We took several mules, and three noble Andalusian steeds. I was HOW going on the most just and honourable expedition that ever man had taken. The career of Balthazar seemed to have been that of a villain from his cradle. By his own account he had dealt in blood and murder ever since he could do anything. Poison and a knife were familiar to him. He was in truth a wild beast let loose upon society. He had come in my path and crossed me with the basest and most mercenary motives ; he had vowed enmity against me without a single act of provocation, and he had carried out that enmity by driving me from the gipsies where I had so long been domesticated, by plotting against my Francesca by forcing us to light; by procuring my own confinement and her abduction; and family by his cruel murder of my innocent wife in my very presence. My own fate would doubtless follow, unless I purged the earth of such a wretch. His destruction, therefore, became my duty. My companion, Julian, strove to amuse me, or to lend me into conversation, but I was too much absorbed in thoughts like these to attend to him, or to answer his remarks. The moon shone above us, an orb of silver splendour, and lighted up the whole mountain with a soft and gorgeous loveliness ; but a sad and melancholy halo seemed to wrap all things, and when I gazed upwards to the stars they seemed to gleam over me with a cold reproachful glance, which penetrated to my heart. But when I looked before me I knew that in the mountain dwelt that fierce, relentless tiger who had destroyed my hopes of earthly happiness for ever, and I was resolved that no feeling of pity or com- punction should stay my hand, until it was red with his life blood. We passed over the smaller hills that seemed like seas suddenly petrified, and reached a gentle slope, which is the first table land. We zested our mules beside a little spring whose waters sparkled like diamonds over the green grass and as the sun now began to rise, we could clearly see the distant peak of Mulhacen, where I knew my enemy was sleeping. How calm and holy is looked ; the abode of innocence itself could not be more still. "While we refreshed ourselves a huge viper stole out of some adjnle'nthrushwood ; he fixed his dark eyes upon us and "need".' fiercely-a greeting which our guide repaid by thrusting him through the stomach with a sword-stick. And here a curious incident occurred. A little bird no bigger than my finger had watched our proceedings very attentively. No sooner was the viper disabled than it blew up with the feathers on its neck standing on end ; its eye was all fire ; it flapped its wings and piped a strange and shrill note of exultation. Every time that any portion of, (the venemous beast writhed convulsively, thft.bb;4 shrank back in deadly fear; soon, however W returned to the charge, and pecked the viper with its' beak, after which it would rise in the air three or four feet, chirping loudly again and again. I do not know what the serpent could have done in its lifetime to the little bird, or what was the feeling of hatred we had gratified by killing the viper ; but it is certain that I never beheld such an amount of delight in anything before. "It is a good omen," said my companion, and I hailed it as such. We mounted our mules and proceeded onward in silence. The sun had now fully risen, and revealed to us the wild and ragged aspect of the mountain. We could no longer see the summit, for each separate table land and all that was above it but we could form an idea of the vast extent over which we traversed. On every side were awful chasms, deep down into the base of the mountain. I looked into them and longed to fling my foe headlong from their tops, and so suspend him half alive on one of the naked crags that rose up out of the bottoms span he was devoured by snakes, or cats, or vultures, fire crossed a path scarcely two feet wide, on either side of which yawned one of these frightful abysses, hut I scarcely saw them. On and onward seemed to be the only thought in my heart, and I believe I should have walked with naked foot over a red-hot plank of iron spikes, without feeling pain if I had but beheld Dom Balthazar at the other end, so ardent was my thirst for vengeance. The eagles rose and screamed above our heads. I hailed the tutelary birds with joy, and in their shrill clang I recognised, as it were, a voice from heaven urging me to go on, on. We were here met by a caravan of donkey drivers, descending from the higher points of the mountain with their panniers of snow. We stopped and questioned them. My guide was the spokesman. Lifting his sombrero, and being profoundly, he asked whether they had met anyone that morning on the upper hills? They answered no, but on the day before they had seen a tall, dark man with a great beard, who seemed watching the distant city Tooth a large glass, and was so intent that he did not even see them pass. We bade them good-bye, and rode on. This was Balthazar; I knew him by the description. He was then evidently alarmed. Probably he was even now on the alert. Speed was necessary-in rapidity of movement was my only chance. We urged on our miles more quickly than ever. The Andalusian horses which up to this were led by a youth belonging to the band were tethered here, so that we might have them fresh for our return. The boy stayed with them to watch. The snowy region now appeared. We had got to traverse a terrible wild of rocks and precipices, flung as it were by the careless hand of some Titan upon the ascending slopes. It was as if a thousand Stonehenge were are all passed into one confused ruin. We Saw innumerable snakes and vipers, and disturbed a vast variety of birds, whose shrill and angry cries disconcerted us a good deal. They protested against our intrusion on their domains. They seemed to have the face of man. Had they but known his heart as intimately as I have they would have had little reason to loathe his presence. From this place we could see an immense rock, that rose towering to the right. My guide pointed it out. j' In yonder neck, he said, " the man you seek abides. But if you speak let it be in whispers. The thin air carries the voice far, and your approach may be known before you are quite ready. With a good rifle from yonder elevation the gipsy thief might easily shoot you to the heart. And he always goes armed." with what a fierce exulting joy I fixed my eyes upon the accursed dwelling of my foe. In an hour we should be there in an hour I should grapple with the destroyer of Francesca, and rid the world of his presence for ever. Oh! that I had done it on that well-remembered night when his life was in my hands, and a touch of the trigger would have prevented all these miseries I had undergone; would have preserved the life that was dearer to me than mine own and given me happiness for all the future. But it was not to be and it was now too late to repine. Wre dismounted again under the covert of some of the vast fires with which the place was filled ; our mules were sadly tired ; we ourselves also were in need of refreshment, and we were quite sure that if Balthazar had not already escaped, and were in the mountain, he could not now elude us. We let our mules browse freely, and gave ourselves up to the necessary indulgence of food and rest. The sun was now in his zenith; all was still and bright; but the mountain air cooled the beams that otherwise would have struck death. We bathed our feet and brows in a gushing turn, and were again ready for the saddle. " It seems to me," said Jillian, "that the greatest caution is now requisite. If we proceed further at present, we shall one and all of us be picked off by this fellow's bullets, as easily as a child may fling a stone against a wall. With the \- elevation that he commands, and the front we shall present, Escape, would be hopeless, and from what we awhile ago heard, it is evident that the gypsy will not be caught napping. Indeed, I should not wonder if he has already discovered our approach with his telescope, and only waits until we are within a safe distance for his rifle, to rid himself of all further apprehension, or pursuit. "What say you, senor " There was no disputing the sagacity of my companion's remark. To wait was evidently the wisest and safest course for ourselves ; but was it certain that, while we were so dilatory, the foe, supposing that he had discovered our pursuit, would make off by some other route, and rid us of all further trouble about him. Besides, I was now in a state of wild and savage excitement. I felt as a hound feels when he scents the track of game. I longed to see his blood, to dapple my hands in it, to see it now in the stones. I was become a perfect wild beast in my thirst for vengeance. While my judgment, therefore, for a moment approved of the counsel of Julian, my passions stood up against it, and after a brief pause I decided to proceed " Julian, ' I said, "I must go on I should . drop dead if I were to remain here inactive until evening ; the very anxiety of the delay would kill me "Whatever be the risk, I shall proceed I feel a presentiment that I shall not die, but that he will fall Meanwhile, my friend now that I have my eye upon this tiger s den, suffer me to proceed alone I shall rf 10in x on when all is over " Julian shook his head ' No,' said he, "I will not consent to this How know we that Balthazar has not friends with men who would overpower you with their numbers, and murder you in cold blood And you are as yet only twenty two I pledge my honour to you, that if he should be alone, I will not interfere with your just revenge it shall be a fair combat between man and man But if he has companions, I and my brother here xxiii aid you to the last gasp, and it shall not be one life that they shall take, but three He said this with such a determined resolution, that I saw it would be useless to argue him out of it I seized him by the hand and

It was not as if I were going to rid a human being of life, but to trample out the existence of some noxious and pestiferous beast, the foe alike of God and man, whom it was a positive blessing to the earth to stay I could now no longer judge of time or space I knew not whether I rode or walked I only found that I was impelled along towards the land where my fee was harboured From this reverie I was aroused by a sudden cry from my companion, and looking up, I saw Dom Ralthozvr who was standing with his back against a steep precipice, and almost before I had seen him my hat was pierced by a bullet, and in a moment after mx mine fell dead beneath me from a second shot Julian instantly. dismounted to give me up the mule which he himself had ridden, but before he could do so the creature reared on its haunches and fell, shot through the very brain Balthasar again aimed at us a fourth time but Julian now fired, and this, or something else unnerved him for the moment, for his shot passed harmlessly over our heads and he re- treated behind his rock, apparently for the purpose of loading again "SVe now lost no time, but charged up the slope To our surprise, no fifth shot was fired but when we reached the place we saw Balthazar already half a mile off, mounted on a splendid mule and fully armed The creature seemed to know the road well, and went forward with a sure foot, but as it was necessary for his rider to get into the route by which we had ourselves ascended, he came gradually nearer, and nearer to us, as he made the circuit, and when he was within pistol range I fired, but missed, and the mule alone was hit She reared, and threw him, and then fell , but he was evidently unhurt, and he stopped to unstrap the carbines from her side We now rushed down upon him, and were so close that he lost his coolness, and he ran off, leaving his fire arms behind him, but still formidable with a sword and dagger He descended the mountain with the speed of a hunted deer We pursued him, but not with equal quickness, for we were a good deal fatigued with our journey Quick and quick, almost as the very thought, he rushed headlong, leaping wildly over all impending obstacles, and we could see he distanced us considerably At length he got to the place where he had left the Andal using steeds tethered Balthazar immediately perceived the value of this discovery

I had made it mad, and it scarcely knew what it did or whither it was borne I myself was perfectly insane We crossed fearful chasms, and rattled down the steep mountain side is you may see the burning lava dash when all Mount Etna is in flame and the moon is red as blood Tire flashed out of every flint dust and smoke were mingled , through stream and underwood we rushed the whole scene before me seemed to wave and roll and whirl the distant Vega stretched out like one vast boiling ocean and it was now near, now afar off, now clothed in blackness, now mantling with sunny light I saw a hundred mocking trends between myself and Balthazar a hundred figures seemed to rise out of the x er) stones and lough me to scorn, and struggle to impede my wild pursuit Metought also that I heard, borne backward by the breeze, the disdainful shouts of a) foe, as he urged on his fiery) courser, and bade defiance to all my threats But now hope arose within my heart We were approaching the place where Captain Bermudez and his friends were lodged, and I doubted not that a bullet from some friendly hand would stop the course, either of the horse of his rider My mule was now getting beat the steed of Arab blood had distanced her, and albeit occasionally I caught a glimpse of Balthazar I was guided in a) pursuit rather by the thunder of his fixing course than by any other indication that I was on the right track But though I could see from afar off that we were right in the bandits course, no sign of stoppage was presented On the contrary, Balthazar appeared at the extreme end, having safely passed through the bandit s bivouac I urged in) xv earied mule more and more, but more and more she faltered in the rice At length as I galloped madly down a narrow bridle road, through which I could still hear the far retreating echoes of the Andalusian s hoofs and iron shoes, the mule staggered, groaned, and would have fallen headlong had I not supported her with a tight rein, and checked her terrible course But scarcely had I stayed her, and dismounted, when she fell dead before me , her heart was broken in the fearful race I lost no time in pressing onward The first person I saw was Captain Bermudez In a few moments I told him all He charged furiously over his hamstrung steeds , nor was he less enraged about ; that which Balthazar was so unceremoniously using , butheoidered out the finest stallion he possessed I and, forcing some wine down my throat, he mounted me again, and bade me God speed ' "I would have shot the fellow as he passed, ' he said, " but I know revenge is sweet, and I would not deprive you of the heavenly morsel,' and I was glad he would not And now I was mounted like a king Never was a nobler steed than that which m) friend Bermudez owned His Arab

by the Gods, I do not exaggerate No praise can be too great for me to give this splendid animal I have loved and honoured the horse ever since that day for his sake and I never until then appreciated the deep wisdom of Swifts adventurous traveller, who, like Ulysses, though he had seen and known the customs of so many strange people, yet found all the virtues under heaven only in the horse in a few words Bermudez told him what I meant that I was following a fiend, and must perish or destroy him and he patted his neck, and pinched his ears, and bade him be my friend in all I did And well, oh noble Sehm, didst thou understand th) master s word He passed proudly ere I mounted him, he turned upon me his eyes, of full and bright intelligence, and when I was seated on his back, he moved forward with a stately grace that passed almost from a tree into the speed of a lightning flash But a moment since I was with the bandits and now where were they On, on, and we were at Alba) cm The perforated caverns of the Gitanos crowned with Indian fig-trees and shrubs of emerald green, passed before my eyes like a quickly moving panorama I had a short glimpse of hundreds and hundreds of dark eyed children rolling before their mother s doors, or crowning each other with flowers, but, like a flashing meteor, I was there and gone, and, though my brethren rushed in crowds to see me, attracted by the thundering noise of my horses hoofs, I can only recollect all that then occurred like a nightmare dream I had now wholly lost sight of Dom Balthazar, but some of the Gitanos had pointed out the food he had taken, and it was that precisely which I supposed he would pursue It was in the direction of San Roque, from which, as I supposed, he might possibly obtain a passage on board ship, and thus effectually baffle me for the present; And now I had got outside Granada, and was lk the glorious Yega, dryer which I passed like fire, inquiring of every passenger whether a fly- ing horseman

a hiding place, for they were full seven feet high, but I was so careful in my motives, and the answers to all tallied so well, that I had no doubt he was still in the high , road ahead and he had already stacked his horse B speed, so confident was he that my mule had failed or speedily must do so And now I passed La Mala, and over this wretched road and gloomy country which lies between that and Iluelmn, passed in less than twenty minutes, cheering my noble steed, and patting him on neck and head, until I felt that in every nerve and vein he fully BJ sympathised with his rider Yes, by Alla ' it was a glorious hunt I likened myself to an avenging angel pursuing some odious demon My brain swims with but excitement a thousand glorious purple flashing thoughts darted across it, as I beheld the earth and heaven, the mountain and the river, dance as it were before me, or come mingle into one mighty chaos, through which I saw only one district being, and that the object of my pursuit The splendid epic recollections of the past rose before me, and I was by turns every god and here I had heard or read of, from the Orient Rustam to the Western Rinaldo Now I was Jove, following the Tritons with avenging thunderbolts, and hurling the wfl lightnings of the spheres, now I was Apollo in his fun gleaming chariot, riding in the path of heaven , now I was Pin ton, w

mountain peak, that I learned that Dom Balthazar had but left at one gate of the town as I entered at the other It was at this time nearly night, but still I determined to go on until I came up with him And now there was a steep descending road of some miles, through horrible passes, and even deserts, bounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by a secluded valley, where witches might have dwelt and held their horrid orgies The moon was up, the stars were overhead, and I could see before me to a great extent Judge of my joy when, about four miles in front, and in an open path on which the light descended brightly, I saw Dom Balthasar riding leisurely down the incline, as if there were no such creatures as Arab steeds and avenging Englishmen in existence The sight drove me mad with excitement, and though I was now sorely fatigued, the hope that this desperate pursuit was drawing to a close revived me with new vigour, and patting the neck of my glorious horse, he rose under me with redoubled energy and power, and visibly gained on the retreating enemy O, blessed moon still shine on me as now, and soon shall I overtake this flying assassin and e O stars, lend me still j our

before their awful sanctity So felt this horrid wretch Casting one quick and fearful glance back wards, he saw the Just Avenger on his track I could feel magnetically that he shuddered, even to his hearts sore I could feel, as it were in my own vital being, that a mighty arrow had gone forth from me, and smitten him with icy coldness He fled, but his steed evidently flagged, and when my glorious Selim knew that the hated enemy was at hand, he snorted like a mighty spirit of thunder, and redoubled his fierce pursuit He tore up the earth , he flung the stones beneath his feet, like so many straws, the ground flashed in the dark night, as if the Cyclopes were beating it with their steel hammers The rapidity, the dreadful energy of his wild course, was something supernatural He seemed animated by a spirit which belonged not to the earth , the whole landscape ran past me ; it whirled in my eye, and was gone I was no longer matter of myself The demoniac wildness of my horse entered into and became part of m j own being I was the Wild Hunts man of the Black Forest I was bent on Death, and I fled with the speed of Death I lifted up my eyes to heaven, and the stars themselves whirled by and were outBtnpt I was close upon him, and my heart began at length to beat And now the final struggle evidently was at hand I knew that we must meet for life or death in less than half an-hour, and I rejoiced that the encounter was so near But Balthazar, had evidently no relish for fighting On the contrary, the moment that he heard my horses hoofs, and looking back, guessed by the uncertain light that I was on his track, he urged on his jaded steed as hardly as he could, hoping to reach Vale?, where he might probably claim the aid of the authorities, and involve me in fresh troubles But he reckoned without his host in this I earned upon him so rapidly that he struck out of the high road, and fled across the country, making towards the terrible deserts of the Sierra de Tepida, where doubtless he hoped, from his knowledge of the place, to bewilder and mislead me. The sky now became overcast, and I lost sight of him for some time , I could not even hear his horse's hoofs upon the soft herbage, but my steed knew, as if by divine instinct, that I was pursuing him to the death, and I left him to follow in the other coursers footsteps, and admirably he did so. His Sagacity was perfect. The first moment that the moon emerged from behind the cloud I saw we were close upon Balthazar, anda more rugged, wild, or lonely scene could scarcely be presented than that which met my eye. for it was nothing but a medley of rocks, and tors, and hissing more tam streams, with scarcely any vegetation-the very) place that a brave would select for a murder, or box dist for a ghost story Nature herself seemed to have hooped every given accessory about it that could lend to Solitude and desolation their most imposing features " In this place, ' 1 said, shall this man die and fat it is for such a fiend The vulture and the wolf shall have his body as for his soul, the devil will take care of that HIS horse was now wholly knocked up, and could not move a foot further All further flight XVOB useless He whirled round and faced me He was deadly pale , but his eyes were in range of hell fire in his hand he held a sword , he had no firearms, this was perhaps lucky for me , but Satan generally diserts these fellows in the end, and they want the very implement of devildom which would serve them most But his courage was as usual, un- flinching, and one he could not murder, he resolved to fight n e He remained on his steed awaiting my attack He had not long to do BO MX horse was already going at a furious pace, and I resolved not to check him On the contrary, I had no doubt I should bear him down like a whirlwind before me So far, therefore, from reining in n x steed, I urged him still more resolutely with voice, and hand, and heel, and rode him right against Bolthozw The shock was dreadful He flew out of the saddle like a rocket, and fell heavily on the ground As he did so, the sword which he still held in his hand entered his heart, and he was dead in an instant Thus perished Dom Balthazar I left him to the wolves, and rode back to Grounds, much more satisfied than when I left it I was cool enough to lead back to Captain Bermudez the footsore Arab, which the dead dex it had run away with, and we both rejoiced men) over many a flask of Bunny Val de Penna From Edward Wortley Montagu, an Autobiography
