On the occasion of his contemplated visit to the old country, a presentation was made to the Hon J b 1 attention at the Protestant hall last evening There was a numerous attendance, and amongst the audience there were several ladies The chair was occupied by Mr W ni flutes. Apologies for non attendance were received from Mr James Balfour, li L C ; the Very Rev Dean Al scoring., Rev Henry Langley, Mr T Nimmo M L X , Rev Dr Gilchrist, and other gentlemen The proceedings were opened by the singing of the National Anthem The Ciiviiuns, in his opening remarks expressed the pleasure it gave him to preside on the occasion About 12 or 14 months ago there was a feeling raised in Victoria in a lation to the action of certain members of the Legislative Assembly and at that time the gentleman who was with them that even mg occupy d in the Assembly a position which every one of them would have been prou 1 to fill (Hear hear) borne few years ago when the Queen sent one of her sons to Australia, he was treated in a way that was a disgrace to any civilised community, but when the action took place, and the loyalty of the people of A IC tone was called forth, everyone" who had a square yard of bunting hoisted it as a mark of their loyal attachment to the Queen and her family (Loud cheers.) Public meetings- were held in Melbourne, Ballarat, Castlemaine, and other places to express disapprobation of the conduct of the five members of the Assembly, and their approval of the course taken by Mr Patterson Lcsolu tions Here passed at those meetings and for warded to Her Majesty Votes of thanks were also passed to Sir Patterson but these had never been presented to that gentleman and his approaching departure on a visit to England was deemed a suitable occasion on which to present those votes in a united form It had been suggested that the should be accompanied by a purse of seven days but this Mr Patterson would not agree to and suitable souvenirs had been substituted He was sure they would all join with him heartily in wishing Mr Patterson success in his journey to the old country, and in hoping that on his return he would occupy even a higher position than he had done thus far (Loud cheers) His individual opinion was that in these colonies national distinctions should be obliterated but while the Protestants were willing that this should be the case, another party founded lodges in different parts of the country, which ultimately became machines for the electoral power of Victoria. Die Protestant community, although constituting two thirds of the population, lost its influence at elections through want of cohesion, while the other vote being concentrated carried the day and a politician who had done a great deal of good for the country the late Sir John O'Shanassy- was able to boast in the House that he could make and unmake Ministers line was enough to convince the Protestants of v learns that it was time they attempted to counteract the power that prompted a man to stand up in the I ec,tbluturcand make such instances uses that (I beers ) He had now to perform one of the most pleasing duties that could occupy their attention that evening namely, that of presenting to Mr Patterson an address from the loyal citizens of Victoria, which read as to How s - To the Ilot ourable I 11 Patterson M L A Dear Sir-We the undersigned lciiticnt-of Victoria nutt loyal subjects of her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen in antU patron of your intended was t to Europe desire most respectfully to express 0 to profound U] pre tation of the very valuable ser- vices v on have rendered to the colony in your public position as a member of our Parliament, an 1 in your official capacity on many occasions as one of her Majesty s -lim ter We In common with the thousands of our fellow colonists who would be only too glad to ALLIE final full dress if they could be afforded an opportunity of doing, so before your dear little beg, to assure you that v ott i press the entire confidence of the loyal people of Victoria As a member of our 1 Parliament von has in no small decree assisted in moulding 1 at lie on action willie by due attention to your public entitles you have been instrumental in assisting to place on the Statute book mind important and fateful I measures as a Minister of the Crown jouratlmiuis section of the various departments reflected credit on yourself was approved by the public and has resulted benefice div to the interests of the colony for letters t on of patronage and reform of the public service which during, the late session of 1 arltaitieut has been passed into law had its inception during your administration But what has endeared you more particulars to us and to all loyal residents through out the colony was your fearless and outspoken utterances at a time when a section of this community attempted to sow the seeds of discord treason and di loyalty in our midst _ourdcnuucia tion of the inf unions Grattan Address and Its signatories aroused the feeling- of Her Majesty's to) al subjects here to a proper sense of their duty in such a manner is his titled lustre to your n uno and glory to our a long and country the result of Uto late el ction tho I banishment from public life of an early all who attended the infamous address and the present It retical legislation of today may be traced, both directly and indirectly to your efforts In parting, with you for a short Benson, we humbly and earnestly pray that till ( great Architect of the Universe may watch over you and yourselves war both on sea and land, and guide you in safety to the house of liberty and the land of freedom as a trusted leader to proclaim their loyalty of the people of Vi toria to the Crown of Great Britain while we will fondly cherish the hope that you may be spared to return in s. fear to meet once more the many warm firms who now bid j oil farewell and earnest hope that you will on your return be able to take even a more retirement part in our public affairs -We are, j Yours, c W I-UAH BALLS Lou 1 cheers followed the reading of the address the Cn MUM was then presented Mr Patterson with the address beautifully bound, and in doing so said that if ever Mr Patterson's loyalty was called in question in the colony of Victoria he had only to show this address, and say flint is a presentation I received from the loyal colonists of Victoria (Cheers.) He had now very great pleasure in calling upon Mr James Munro to present an address to Mr Patterson Mr JAMES MARTIN said he had been requested by the Victorian Alliance to attend the present gathering with a view to pre seating an address to Mr. Pattison on the occasion of his leaving the colony They had all heard a great deal about Mr. Patterson s loyalty, but whilst Mr. Patterson came to the front in these matters there were others in which he rendered very valuable assistance (Cheers) Above all things in a public man, he (Mr Munro) appreciated the quality of having the courage of his opinions On the question of local option Mr Patterson had been as outspoken us he had been on other subjects He hoped that gentleman would meet with a good reception from the a love items of local option in the old country The address he had been requested to present was as follows:- To the Honourable J is Patterson MX A line lrablcand__ar_tr -We thoE-ocutlvoCom imtteeolthc Victorian Alliance desire to join with your nuittorotts fr en is in wishing, you upon the occasion of your departure for England a pleasant an 1 beneficial journey and a safe return Vi of also deem this a suit the al portunity for expressing our apt relation of your efforts to secure for the people of Victoria the right of restraining the issue of public IIOUAO licences your speech in I armistice t upon the local option re after a move 1 by the Hon James Munro human "eye productive of much good In prepaid to, the way for oil clive legislation In bidding jottfirewcll we therefore I CL, jour accq tance of mr I heartfelt thanks for your services in the cause which we specially at present in addition to our good v is! as tor journeying mercies And we would of further solicit Inr join a line 1 and cordial reception from the friends of the lot ii 0 Lion movement at hot c cspLct ll flout the rear wind and honoured leader MrWUtrld Lawson Bart MP whose vast experience should be of service to kindred reformers in Victor a Trusting that our anticipations of enjoyment ml of let oil. t) your health will be more than realised and that you will in due time return tore sure your labours for the best out of out 1 bird colony - Vic- m-L honourable and dear sir. on behalf of the executive committee of the Victorian Alliance your most obedient 6in ants I-MCS Murano I re ment J W Iluvr, Chairman Jolts V AH Secretary Melbourne January 7 1884 The Rev Dr PoniEis was the next speaker it afforded him great pleasure to come forward to address a meeting on such an ocMiaion as this The loyalty which so distinguished Viet fri m received a rude shock when members of the Legislative Assembly dared to become signatories to a seditious and disloyal address On that memorable occasion Mr Patterson had the boldness and moral courage to call those men to account, and to move their expulsion from the state which they had dishonoured (Cheers) 'I hear friend had also done much to stem the rising tide of disloyalty and s< ditton and to checkmate the operations of the Land Leaguers (Cheers.) the CHAIRMAN then called upon Mr J J -Crompton grand secretary of the Protestant Alliance I Friendly Society of Australasia, to read the address from that body to Sir Patterson Mr CROMPTON then read the address, as follows - Protestant Alliance Friendly Society of Australasia To the Hon J li Patterson Esq MLA ' Dear Sir-We the undersigned Grand Lodge officers of the Protestant Alliance friendly Sudden, resident in Victoria take advantage of your intended departure for Europe to thank you on behalf of the members of our society for your um easing efforts in the cause of revolt, and ROCK! government V our recent effort to free the Victorian Legislature from the taint of disloyalty has won for you a place in the hearts of all our members while your straightforward, manly defence of loyal Victorians, exposure and denunciation of the Oration address stirred li o I cart of the country and effected the enforced retirement from public life of some of those who 0 stated it We earnestly hope that both yourself and Mrs I atterson may enjoy your contemplated trip to Europe and that you may return again In good health long to be spared to assist in building upon empire worthy of Uto grand old mother country from which we spring " We have the honour to be, faithfully yours, ' J_M_sV_f__.s WOM ' Time- Ball., DOM ' O G-OVKH, O Chaplain G H Woonmu), M G E Wtu.t-11 to KMOHT, Q Guardian " W'ruie- F-BOO-O», G Trees.

The Rev T JVJIKS also addressed the meeting In doing so he said that Mr 1 at thereon was a model representative of the public as well as of his own constituency He had known Mr Patterson both publicly and pay lately, and he was ever even more than ready to be foremost in helping forward every good work It might be said that Mr Patterson the only beginning his career, and he had the political impulse, wisdom, and vitality to be of service to his home and to his country (Cheers ) 1 be rev gentleman then presented Mr Patterson with a gold watch, chain, and locket and also a old brooch and earrings and gold bracelet for Mrs Patterson Mr Pv-Tinsoh, on rising to return thanks was received with loud and prolonged cheering He said that on the eve of his trip to England it was most gratifying to him to r ceive the generous expressions contained in their several addresses and he trusted they would permit him to return them our warmest thanks for their great kindness 1 specially did he value that portion of the present station which came from the loyalists of Victoria Cheers) To be loyal was an honourable title a title that could be adopted by men can rank, of any class or of any creed to be loyal to the institutions under which they lived and to be loyal in all the relations of he became the best man in any country (Cheers ) w here the people were loyal the state had nothing to fear and the community could live individually in perfect harmony If it is the desire of Australians he was sure to get along pretty quietly and in this parti- ally populated country we were glad of the companionship of people coming from any part of the civilised world it entered largely into the training of colonists to make themselves agreeable with all sorts and conditions of men, and they begin to discover that there were intelligent and industrious people from other parts of the world besides their ott n Indeed, he might point to our excellent friends the Germans and others who but an example in the matter of industry and the amenities of social life which reflected credit upon themselves and would have a beneficial effect in Victoria (Cheers ) Vii opportunity occurred some years since whereby visitors could criticise our actions and taken look at us and indeed it put us upon our best behut course alluded to the Exhibition of lfeSO We came through the examination pretty well The result was satisfactory to our pride as colonists as the founders of a great colony an 1 we were able to say in thclanc,ua_,eof the Queen s speech that we were at peace with all foreign powers (Laughter and cheers.) But unfortunately we were not at peace with ourselves The Exhibition hall find benefit closed with congratulations with an almost unprecedented and we find scarcely let go the friend hand of our visitors before it began to be discovered that there were i nerves in our midst and that they were of our own household (Hear hear) We begin to die cover that there it is an attempt to son the speed < t sedition in this virgin soil and metaphorically it became the duty of every man to do it out of the ground (Loud cheers) There was no time to be lost and he rejoiced to say that the task was satisfactory accomplished 'J hej bad 11 can is old enough to give him credit It r borne blaze in that good work This he would say that they stilled treason on the threshold, us subsequent events are Ij ] tovell (L ud cheers) None so daring, since that time as to speak treason pul help all constrained to speak with respect of our ii st gracious Majesty the ( for en and other institutions (Cheers ) It was announced with a great flourish of trumpets that two young men would come from the old country, and so electrify Australia with oratorical fervour that an army would use up and cross the sea to seek revenge for injuries committed 500 j cars use daughter and cheers.) But to the credit of the young gentleman in question it must be said that the conducted themselves bek are selected audiences in a most unobjectionable manner Their harangues were of the patent safety kind-they would only strike on the hot (Laughter) it was carefully arranged that when one brother had the matches the other brother in some distant part of the country had the box- (Laughter)- and then tore there was no ignition or combustion Huj came to Australia for the purpose of explaining the cause of a secret and foul murder, which they failed to do (Hear, hear) and then departed amidst the hurrahs of the pleasant and public ceremony of marriage (Laughter and cheers) and if rep rt spoke truly they were not indifferent to the charms of filthy lucre Ilieae frowning patriots who came here prepared to die for their country thought it better afterwards to multiply what they called I their down trodden race (Laughter and cheers.) They offended no living being the talked of wrongs committed centuries ago, and most people felt an inclination to have a go in at their ancestors and if the he could have been resurrected at the correct point of some period of speech there would probably have been such a scene that LOan, brook fair would have been small potatoes compared with the action that would have occurred (I laughter and cheers ) to seek revenge for wrongs committed 500 years ago was indeed amusement worthy of a race of Kip a mi w ml les Modern civilisation taught and marked a divergence of the w IJS of those who dreamt only of the past, and thought only of their next meal from the ways of the hopeful the cheerful the gentle and the contented who could realise the fact that there was good time now, and so act as to ensure a better time in the future 1 opal Australian states men were at present engaged in stretching, out the boundaries of the British Empire in securing Australian peace in cementing Iintibh power and those who now managed and attempted to cripple the march of progress by prompting internal discord and disloyalty, were ten times were enemies than any the empire had to tear from foreign aggression In all these colonies the predominant feeling amongst public men was to preserve and strengthen the bond that unites us to the empire A state which was disunited in itself could not present that front to a foe that it otherwise would They knew well the value of the imperial connexion They valued too highly Lntibh institutions They knew that as parts of the empire they were powerful and they know too well the advantages 'they enjoyed even to dream of severing the connexion (Cheers) Hievhvel under institutions that were the envy the world for justice and much less and honor the name of Englishmen was revered every when As colonisers area sought to impart the principles of pace. and progress and the cause of him and had never suffered in their name The name of I englishman was admitted by fore girls to be a name that should be revered a amongst the nations of the world not because they bowed down to any particular form or person but because of the grandeur and splendour of their laws and the freedom which they enjoyed People were invited from all parts of the world to come to these colonies and enjoy their freedom (Hear, hear 1 these laws and institutions they win determined to hold by (Cheers ) list find no hope, seeing the cncouni|,etner*n which rebels are cured in the old country, that there would be any spec ly improvement on the part of those whom he need not name In his opinion they should have been dealt with more sternly at the commencement (Hear hear ) What had been the effect As soon as one demand was granted another was immediately made, and they were now as far off the end of the matter as ever They would not be deserving the name of loyal if they permitted the cloven hoof to be displayed and sat silently by (Hear, hear ). He trusted it would never again be necessary in this colony to adopt the measures that had to be adopted some time ago (Cheers.) He had now to turn to a subject more pleasant in its nature and on 1 behalf of Mrs Patterson and himself to thank them for the demonstration that had taken place in their honour this meeting had not been prompted by any society it represented the entire dm munity On their journey the tokens of esteem that had been presented would serve to unite their hearts in remembrance with those by whom they had been presented, and would help to hasten them back to their adopted home He need not till them that going home now was a very simple matter the first trip he took to Castlemaine took precisely the same time it now took to go from bore to England It took him six weeks to go from Melbourne to | Castlemaine, in company with several bullock drays, one of which was loaded with brandy and the other with peppermint (Laughter ) ' And by some strange coincidence there was an extraordinary deficiency at the end of the journey Now it took only a few hours to reach Castlemaine from Melbourne in conclusION, he begged, on behalf Mrs Patterson and himself, to return those present their very warmest thanks Mr Patterson resumed his seat amid loud cheers. Major SMITH M L.A in proposing a vote of thanks to the chairman referred to that gentleman being a member of the House nearly a quarter of a century ago. He also spoke in the most eulogistic terms of Mr Patterson Mr R D REID M L A in seconding the vote of thanks, said that a more honest, straightforward, upright man than Mr. Patterson was never known in the colony The vote of thanks to the chairman was carried amid loud cheers I Mr PArsoN, in expressing his unknot ledgments to the chairman for his kindness in presiding said he omitted to mention that the two young gentlemen he was speaking about did manage to raise about £10 000 to spend on the antediluvian purpose of raising their ancestors, and he observed that they were wandering about San Francisco trying the game on there in a similar way, but whatever they night say that they got home or anywhere else, the fact was that in this community the people took no notice of them whatever The public here were utterly in ill 1 el < nt, t> them and it the music propriated the lo 000 or f.4 000, or whatever the sum was in tabling the living it would have done a great deal more good than in trying to raise the ghost of the dead (Cheers ). He might also mention that in his opinion we did not have justice done to us by casual visitors from the old country, like Mr Archibald 1 Forbes, who they would all deny was capable of forming an opinion as to the state of public feeling out here That gentleman had lately asserted in a flippant way that the colonies were prepared to sever from the old country that in point of fact they would hastily hoist the kangaroo and the emu and start business on their own account It was not necessary to say that in that state int but Mr Forbes did not represent Australian feeling at all Judging, by his reminiscences he appeared to be a man better able to take tliemeasureofmen Hbootstliunof theirbrnuiB daughter and cheers.) When he talked about the desire of these colonies to separate from the mother country, he was entirely unacquainted with the sentiments of public men of note in any of the colonies there was not one of those public men who would not repudiate such assertions. In till the colonies the people nel nowlcil¡,cd that union with the empire was strength They knew full well the advantages they enjoyed by being connected with the grand old country an 1 1 he trusted some day to be able to lend her substantial aid and strength, because although we might not contribute much towards her support just now, yet the time would come when Australia would not only beabletomaintaiuherself butvvouldhnvc some at night in the affairs of the nation and would be able to help the empire out of any difficulty that might arise (Cheers he proceedings closed with the National Anthem ____________________
