'Tuns' Cavlll and Prof. Pannell ('the ?water wizard' ) gave displays of their capa bilities at different periods cf tho eveninr 'Turns' ' exhibition wns cut short Just as' everybody appeared to bo enjoying it thor oughly owing to the springboard glvinj' way and toppling over into tho wnter on top of the performer. I might remark that the whltc-hnired boy' from. Farm Covo told me subsequent to tho first dive that the plank would i;o by the board directly and sure enough It did half a minute later. Prof. Panncll's show was a very good ono indeed, nnd stamped him as an ornamental swimmer of the first water. Rather an appropriate way of putting It, this. Details or the different events are given eUewhero There was nothing calling far special men tion. Everything went off without a hitch and tho o(Hciinls did llielr bebt to ensure success. The Melbourne Swimming Club were again fortunate in having delightful weather for their second annual carnival thl'i season, which was hold at llegaity's Baths, St. ICIIda, on Saturday (says the Melbourne 'Argus' of last. Monday), tho bright sunshine and the exhilarating south breeze greatly adding to tho enjoyment ot the visitors. Tho attendance was again very.lar.ge, and ladies, us is always the case attliese'mectings, predominated. The pro gramme^ was' too crowded, no limes woro 1 nit on, nnd tho 'farce' could have easily been dispensed with. There-was some com ment as, to the handicapping. In the boys' race, for Instance, the smallest and one ot (he youngest boys, who had never raced boforo, was started behind bigger and more experienced lads, and thus debnrred from a poasiblo chaneo of winning, and tho same defects wcro discernible In other races. The chief event or the afternoon was tho 'Half- mile Championship of -Victoria.-1' There wore only two competitors, T. Mnynnrd and IS. W. Wilson. The raco-was well contested throughout, both men keeping. together all tho way until a fewyards from homo, w'hon Mnyniird.'who had tho Steadier stroke, ob tained a. slight lead, and won the race lu fine stylo by ono length. No ; timo was taken. The annunl matches of tho Goclong Club were hold on Saturday, 'February 17. The principal ovont,, the George ;Gall Bequest Cup; went to Sld'Wijod.

Ono item alone' of the pro gramme 'should have caused tho 'crowdod- buubo' corns to be hung out, i.e.. It tho public generally kno.v that it wns coming oil; but they di-ln't appear to, as therti woro only 100 present. I refer to tho, 220 yards. Chrai'plonshl'p, 'wherein Dick Cavill end Craig were expected to supply a very icicle tussle ail tho way. The actual management ot tho carnival left nothing wanting. -The dirfercnt event* we.-o rattled through with great rapidity— a f.ict which was highly appreciated aftor what we havo been treated to far .1 long .tinio past. Tho arranging of (ho heats ac cording to the starts alloiite'd— that is, to say, brlnglns.all thoscra'tch men together, then those nearest them, and so on to the limit, proveil'-.a welcome Innovation. This :method of dealing with 'inter-club heat.-! makes each almost a scratch, race, and 'takes away a lot frpni tho monotony thnt usually surrounds; them. ..Mr. Starter. Hen ?dry;s.:vo'iee could bo heard giving the' word 'go,'1 then -.'one,' nnd about six or eight coir.pelilors uwpuld lenvo the .platform to gether and swim almost In a lino, tho whole way. Ab evidencing 'tho excellence 'of tha .mauagemont, It': might bo remarked: : that tho. lirst event was 'started at 2.45, and the lust get. rid of at 4.33 p.m. Ever, the'polo match (polo as she is played in' Sydney) ,wa3 not such an Infliction as It generally la— every man Jack of the spectators, strango. to say, stayed to sco It oiit. : .-. Our fiicnds.of thei Western portion of fno city are consequently to be complimented. - There woro seven starters. in the ,220yds Championship, viz.: It.- Craig (Balm.iin S.C.), Ii. Cavill (Otter S.C.). \V. H. Bond (Eastern Suburbs S.C.), W. Bishop (Enter prise' S.C.). L. Clarko (Rnndwick and Cooaeo SiCO, J. Kearney (West Sydney S.C.), and Grcsson (St. Leonards S.C0. The first three finished as placed. Cre-gson and Clarko withdrew- at !!0 ' yards, and Bishop and Kearney two laps (00yds) further on. 'Why any one of them started I am at a loss to conceive,' for none had the ghost of ;i fihow of. even getting a place. The send-off was a splendid one. All touched the water togetber. Ulahop rose in front, and, making the pace a cracker, led down the' first lap (-15yds), with Oavlll Kocond, and ?..Craig, cidso .iiji, -third. This order prevailed, until perhaps SO yards lindMiccn thrown behind, when Cavill spurted up nnd supplanted Bishop. At the !)0 yards' turn Bishop just touched in front nf Craig, whom he! bored on tri '.'ho slops. Midway down the third lap Cavill. hud two yards to the good, but Craig caught him ere the next turn, ami they rounded into thr.- last forty yards to gether. '-Thence 'to tho finish a bitter and Intensely rwiling Giiiigglc ensued. Craij, ultimately 'landed the 'title with a .margin of throo yard.'ivto the good, Bond being ten or twelve yards further otT, iliird. Tline, 2mir. Stijaec. This pcrfoimancc is liitoc sinwer thati the w-orld'a amateur ? recoi-d, v.-hlch is also the Australasian best.' The lirst two men? having cor.iplotetl the dl;, tunco within standard time (2mln uOsec), are. entitled to 'honor' certificates. The times taken by Mr. W. T; iKerr for the -four laps ot -liiyds each, and the. t.\ft of -10yds, wore as follor.-:^-2Sscc; SO.I-Ssee; lmin 33 l-5sec; 2iuin OJsec; 1'min il!)'3-5soe.
