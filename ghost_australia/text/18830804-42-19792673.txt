Ordination of Church of England Clergymen. A CONSIDERABLE congregation assembled on Wednesday week at St. John's Church to witness the ordination as priests of the Revs. Heber Tennant-Tranmar and Clarke Kennedy. His lordship Bishop Hale was assuted by the Yen. Archdeacon Glennie, and the Revs. J. Button, C. G. Robinson, D. A. Court, J. A. Hassal, F. Meeres, W. Kildahl, and G. Houl brook. The Rev. C. O. Robinson intoned the Litany, and was responded to by a full choir. After the Bishop, in impressive tones, had read the address to the candidates for ordination from the Prayer Book, and had asked the usual questions, there was silence in the church for about five minutes, while the congregation and clergy present offered up prayers for the kneeling candidates. The choir then sang the hymn " Come Holy Ghost, our souls inspire." On the conclusion of the hymn, the Bishop and clergy present laid their hands on the heads of both the candidates in turn, while the Bishop solemnly ordained them in the words prescribed by the Church of Eng land. The anthem, <rHow Lovely are the Messengers that bring Us the Gospel of Peace," was next sung by the choir, the solos being beautifully rendered by Mrs. Welshman, while Madame Mallalieu presided at the organ. His lordship, as soon as the anthem was over, briefly addressed the congregation present, taking for his text the 20th verse of the 18th chanter of St. John, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word." In the course of his remarks he insisted on the necessity and efficacy of prayer, and especially asked the prayers of the congregation for the two new priests, one of whom was to officiate in that very church. Many of the congregation then left, but others remained while the Holy Sacrament was administered to the Revs. Clarke Kennedy, and Heber Tennant-Tran mar.
