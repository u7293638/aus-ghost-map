He referred to the: large num ber of important measures nbw before Parlia ment— the Land Bill, Road Bill, Insolvency .Bill, Immigration BiiU and' other Bills now before Parliament, and others which, had been promised— and said 'it would be absurd to ad journ for four weeks at the very time' when; they ought to . address th.epiiselves.tb the 'busi- ness. ' As_ to the waste of time, be said no one had taken up mbre'bf tlie time of the House than Mr. Angas, arid if the hon. member should absent himself from the House he nad no doubt they, would be Able to, get on without him.. — Mr. PBAKCB_ regretted that Mr. Conner should have made 'such a personal Bpeech. He fancied that business would db greatly exoedited if fewer and shorter speeches were made in that House. He thought au adjournment was absolutely necessary now te enable hoa. members to at tend to their own private affairs, and the House should give some consideration to the expressed wishes i ,pf cpuritry 'm'emi-ers.-:-Mr. ROGERS said he should be gaidedby what the Govern ment said in this matter. . He thought it would be i^ery useful 'tha% the GoWnment should have a monthss holiday, in order, to enable them to prepare' and lay before the House iheir future financial policy.— Mr. HUGHES sai'd although there were 50 Bills on the files, the House had as yet done very little with them, atid the real business of the 'session would not really begin till.the Government had laid their financial statement and TEstimate8 before the House; ! He did not think it reasonable that they, should sit there without intermission' from ; January t- December ; ani he should be content to support a brief adjournment— rsay for three weeks. — The Hon. A. BLtTCH Baid they nad 50 Bills before them, with which they had done very little, and now it was proposed to knock off work alto gether. That was a most extraordinary pro posal,' 'for they might rather to. apply them selves with increased diligence to endeavor to! overtake some of the neglected work. He believed that as many country membeis were anxious to go. on with the business as were de sirous of having an adjournment, and the per sonal convenience ef the maioritv oushf to receive consideration. He should vote f or Mr. Conner's motion. — Mr. DERRINGTON should be ungrateful if he did not acknowledge the desire of '.hon. members to consult the conveni ence of the member* for the i South- East in the adjournment which should ne carried. Hb thought a great deal of the time of the House was wasted by unnecessarily .long speeches, and by the continual reiteration, of argumerits. :J .He mbyed that' the 'adjournment-be tiil'16th July.! ^-^Mri BRIGHT argued jtiat £he adjoWnmelit oiE. a month np^;would throw-back the sessipi fpr^tnre^'mSntks, aiid'Lhpni: members ;who - haicf bfeen' teng in thjbHouie knew that thaVcM'mberi was unbearable in summer weather. He shoulc Bilpport -?' JMr.J;e''Cbnner's*a atoeridment.— ^Mr,; WATTS bnefly suppprtetJ :th'ee motion.— The TREASURE ^'there.we '38 different Bills on the files, which ,i)f the^&ves; inyplved a large amount of business, apart from the' Notices of Motion and other important matters. The Billsnow before Jthe House contained 983 clauses,: 6f which only 171' clauses had been dealt with/1 leaving 812 still to be eorisidered, in addition^ to 78 schedules. It must follow,! therefore, either that this must be a great ses sion for work,1 or else that there wcaldbe an; unparalleled slaughter of the innocents- at the1 cloie.'- Sotnie; fit 'Jthe measures, 'however;, were of the highest ! importance. ij The Government,, he said, wejre.5[uite prepared to go on i^ith the, busMesB': But if h'an. members wuriWl a V»n1i.-: day,' they would'have no objection in voting for^ an ^.dJQurnment to 9th July, but they con-, siidered that they could nbt support an adjourri-i meht till 23rd July. In addition to the measures: already before the House, he said the Govern-! ment intended, 'as soon as they had a chance,! to, introduce ?ftesh business,', and if ethe House ! chose to'have an adjournment, the Government j wpuld ^profitably employ their time in perfecting ', their 'mea8ures.?TChie House' would no dodbfc like Jol knoy Hpjnething. of , the financial -olicy of' ttie- GoVernntent'j but he Should' not bring down any financial boliev until he knew.tbn fate! of the .Road Bill and 'Land BilL Ii would be perfectly, absurd, to do soi because whether iheyi^ere to Live '£5&,D00 aferiyftd frboi local rating br not'- should be a fact ascertained before theV could properly* ''deiai. with, the finaridesbf thefollowingyear.' He' Would not say that unless' the House gave thein this £50,000 they -would 'do' this or would jap t dp 'thatj but considering how very intimately the question bf local taxation for roads and the question of the land revenue were connected with! the con sideration ef the Ways ata'd Means, \i would be perfectly absurd for him to' attempt to deal with the. finances of 1872. without knowing upon what principle the roads were to be maintained, and ho* the land revenue Was to be raised. He reliedou tHe csnabr aftd f alt play of hbii. menii bersto support tlie Gorvemnaent in that view. The sooner, J therefore/ tfee Hriuse dealt with the Road Bill and the Land BUI the sooner they would 'get the financial policy of the Govern-: meht;- He. pointed out also that the Estimates and Ways and : Means were seldom' prepareil' before September,' and it 'was better they should not be, because the later on in the year the surer were the; data of calculation for the' following year. He intended, as boon as pos sible after the plose of the half-year, to bring: forward his financial statement, provided he knewthe fatb of the Riiad Bill, for that Bill in volved an amount of £50,000. Under all the3e eir cumstances Jthe Government thought they ought not to consent to a long adjournment. — -Mr. GEYDE said the Treasurer had just used the strongest arguments why they should not adjourn beyond Tuesday next, in order that th'e. opinion of, the House, might be taken as soon as' possible upon the Land and Road BUIb.— -Mr. WARD said' the Government had shown no special desire to .push on the Land Bill or Road Bill, and the Treasurer 'should np'tr speak in ; the dictatorial manner j which' he.' had assumed .that afternoon. iHe moved: tfiaV the adjournment' be ' till 9th July.— Mr.'BUNpEY saifl the arguments that day bore out -the proverb* that 'procrastination' was 'the soul of business,*' and he thought if. they had work to dp they, should go on' With it until it was finished. ~i!Mr. TOWNSfitTD thought, if they were not to' have the financial ' policy till the ttoad Bill and Land Bill had been disposed of, the Government ought not to go on with anything else' till those measures had ibeen disposed d'f.— The COMMISSIONER of CROWN LANDS said it was necessary that the Government should announce firmly the course they intended to propose, because lit would be, ieen' that it would be ex itremeiy inconvenient to adjourn for five weeks. Uf the question went to a division, the Gpyern ment would vote for an adjournment till 9th jJuly.— Mt; DUNCAN seconded the amendment for an adjournment till 9th July. — Mr..RA.M- iSA.'Y; suggested that there should be regular itimesfor the .assembling and prorogation of the Parliament, as in England. He should vote for We. Cpnner's amendment.— Mr. ANGAS 'having replied to Mr. Conner's remarks, said he would be willing to accept the motion for an adjournment till 9th JjUy.

Mr. ANGAS moved—' That petition No. 9,9/ presented on l'4th June, from ' residents of Blanchetowri, Truro, and other places, be printed;' .Carried. -Mr. BKIGHT moved— *'That petition- No. iOS, presented ou 18th June, from electors . voting at Bhynie, be printed.'.

' Mr. WARD move.1, in Committee-' That an;addres8 be presented to._His Excellency the Governor, praying His Excellency to cause I sum, not exceeding '. £500, to be placed on the Estimates for the year 1873, for. the purpose of constructing a jetty- at Port Broughton, and a dam on the road thereto from the Broughton Agricultural Area, and also clearing the sur veyed road from the port, as prayed for by peti tion presented on 17th ApriL' He said he felt in bringiag forward jbbis matter that he bad a case which would not meet with any opposition whatever. Port Broughton was an eligible shipping/ place, and was near the Broughton Area. There was no other port nearer than Port Pirie. Wkeat had been shipped from Port Broughton, but there were great' difficulties in consequence of the want of facilities, . aud the scarcity of water on the road between the port and the area, .also gave rise to considerable difficulty./ By the motion, he asked that this Toad should be surr veyed, and that a dam might §be censtructedj sb that Bufftcient water might be stored for the use of persons travelling the road. There would be from 10,000 to 12,000 acres of land under culti vation in the area this year, and already- as much, as £5,0C0 had been received as interest in respect of land tatcen up in the area. It could easily be calculated ho w, much principal the £5,000 interest representeil Captain Dale was erecting a jetty at the port,, but it was at the present time unknown whether the structure would be an advantage to the people generally using the port. If this jetty were found to meet requirements, ,t&e;: Ooyernuieni would -not be called upon to construct; another; but should that not be. the case, the residents in the area would -consider it a great -hardship if 'the Go vernment refusedtogivethemajetty. Although: a considerable amount of money had been derived from the Broughton Area, no public money hadyet been spent in connection with ii. He certainly thought that a reqaest of that kind, so very reasonable, should receive the attention and support of the House.— Mr. BOUCAUT said he should be guided, in this matter ? by the course the Government intended to take with reference' to it.'— The COMMISSIONER of CROWN LANDS hoped that consideration of the motion would stand over for a short time, so that a repbrt: might be obtained as to what was re quired iir connection with Port Broughton. The GLEfcK-^-Grders bf the Day. TRANS- CONTINENTAL RAILWAY BILL— A0JOURNED DEBATE ON SECOND READING-, /. /.. .'',, - xne u.Qn. o. uust tnougnt this was a measure that should be dealt with immediately. It had been said that the Bill might be mpli fied, but it* was for *£e/Hpuse to deal with the ^Bill as. jt presented itself , to thera'; and it ap peared, to 'him to be .a most . extraordinary atternpif to oljtain an iminense area of land, beyond anything he had .eVer heard of before. (Sear,, hear.) It quite t»ok his breath away when he first heard of the extent of the tract of counfary asked for^a laugh)— aud he could not believe- that such a proposal could be brougnt under the consideration- of the Legis lature without being sure to be thrown out. (Bear, hear.) ; He would call attention to one or two points connected with the- BilL In the first place there was no liability what ever. A Company- was said to be formed, which was a limited Company. (Mr. Solomon — '.Very,' and a laugh.) There was kto clause providing for the payment of any sum to in sure the bona fides of the project; but there was a clause that did away with all liability ex cept that referred to in clause .9, by which, if the railway was not kept in proper order, pos session.' might be taken by the Government. But that would not make much difference ; for the fact was that the Company undertaking to carry put the work could demand tne fee. simple of a. very large extent of country for every ten miles of railway constructed by them. Means had been adopted ' with, a . vie w .of .securing a favorable expression of opinion outside, but he was sure if the House looked into, the Bill they wpuld -condeoinit 'and tferbw' it but at once, (Hear, iiear.) ' Ne doubt there was some diffi culty in meeting the plausible argument that the construction of the railway would lead to £10,000,000 -being spent in South Australia. Such an argument had, an effect upon these persons who did not care a fig about the future, but said. . *' Let us get a portion of the £10,000;000'— not . that that amount would reallv'be snerit here— -'' and lei fhe'fiilrnrA *alr« care ,. of itself ;' but h.e asserted that it was tneir duty as legislators to loos: to and take into consideration the future. (Hear, hear.) He ob served as a curious circumstance that a good number of those persons whp had given their names as prompters ^were opposed, to liberal treatment of 'would-be cultivators of the land ; and .yet they were willing to dispose of 200,000,000 acres in the manner proposed. If the Government were to* sell this quantity of laud for Is. an acre, would they -expend the proceeds in the construction of such a railway? Were tt ere not works of more importance than that? He'had'giyen some little consideration to the subject,' and to him it was quite clear that if they raised money as he had suggested, they should not expend it in making a railway; and jthat being so, it showed the absurdity of their selling the lind cheaper than they would ;tb, other' people^ that they might have a work which would ;be useless to a very large extent. It would be well to consider what 'really was the object, the promoters of this scheme had iu view. He.was^urethey.had not. told' the. House nor the people outside; what .their object was; but 'that* object was to be gathered from the Bill itself. According to the Bill, the Company could begin at both ends, or ;at one end only — they were not bound to make' a B^rtaia portion every year, nor were they bound ~ to make any particular part. Bat if ithey constructed 150 miles of railway iu the Northern Territory,' they would be able to claim a very large tract of country there. Wotild' it, 'he would ask, be worth while to give 16,000,000 acres of /land in the Northern Tenitory for a /line running 150 miles into the interior ? They, would admit that would be a bad bargain, and that was the quantity of land it was proposed in the Bill to give for such a length of line. . It was proposed to construct the railway right; across the conti nent for £5,000 a mile, but if the extremities of the line would cost that sum per mile they might be quite sure the construction of the central part would cost much more. He would ask the: House to look at the matter in this common-sense way— Was it likely the Company would make, the ljlne where it would be most expensive and least available? It nad been paid, look at - the United ; States ; and looking at 'the United States, he must confess that the. quantity of -railway in proportion to ttie number . of., inhabitants was most extraor dinary ; but the result was not so very, satis factory, for the railways l&eing; iu the hands of private individuals those companies had exer cised , a great influence upon the Legislature, members of which had been bribed to au enor nous extent. These railway companies had created a state of things in America that they should be very sorry to see existing here. (Hear,, hear.). But if the railway across the continent were made, they would be able to show ten times the amount of railway, in proportion to the population, to what existed in the United States. (Hear, hear.) It was absurd for the House to 'entertain the proposal, for it was unquestionably never intended by the promoters to carry it out in its entirety. He had heard little or no real expression of opinion with reference to the matter outside;' and .he felt that 'few persons had had. an op portunity of properly considering it in its monstrous proportions. The Commissioner of Crown Lands had introduced a Bill for the' purpose of opening up the land in the Northern Territory.; Now supposing the Legislatuie agreed to what the Bfll sanctioned-— that if a Company made 150 miles' of railway into the interior they should get between 15,000,000 and 16,OQO,000 acres of land, in what' position would the . Government be with a Company having the fee-simple of such a quantity ef land to. dispose of which they had bought at Is. an acre ? How could the Go vernmeEt, charging. 7a. , 6d. per acre, hope to compete at all ? . The Gpyernment might shut, up their Land ' Qffice W the Northern erritory, and on tbia.side of the coutiuent, too, if. the .Company should commence the con struction of the southern end of, the line, because it would be impossible for the Govern ment to compete against them. They would be the lords and masters, (Hear, hear.) /TJbe esttmated cost' t:of 'tb% necessary survef was £200,000, and yet it wa? proposed to give the Company one-half the available portion of the colony, whilst the Government would still .have to pay the whole of the expenses connected with government. Looking at the men who were connected with the scheme, lie noticed the1 names of many of those interested iu the North Australian Company. (Hear, hear.)' Then, again, the whole of the land would be actually tabooed till the Company were satis fied. Until £20O,DO0 had beeu spent in *ot veymg, they could not deal with the land which would not be claimed by the Company. The hon. member for Gutneracha, in his speech, said there were doubts about there being gold found upon this land, about tbe fertility of the soil, but, no one would now doubt about its mineral richness, about its fertility, arid about the adaptability of the land in the vicinity of the Roper for the production of .rice, indigo, &c.; He did not wonder at the hon. member talking of the lana on the Roper in such glowing terms, because that portion of his speech would read well in a .prospectus, for the whole of this land, according to the scheme, went to the Com pany. (Hear/hear.) He trusted that the House would see that the land was not valueless, and also see that there would be no difficulty in disposing of it on good terms —very much better than_ the terms under consideration. He' was sure if a liberal measure was passed with refe rence to land in the Northern Territory, it would be taken up at a fair price by persons will-, ing to cultivate it. Further, he would point out that if this work were carried , out, it would be : done by coolie labor, which would be removed on its completion, aad so no.one would be Bene fited. It appeared to him a most extraor dinary thing that no sum was mentioned as a deposit. Did they propose to pay £100,000 down? (Mr. Solomon— ?' They haven't got it.') He wotfd Btate that the agreement could not contain provisions op posed to the Bill itself. Were they contented : to lock up the land for five years ? arid if the proposal were agreed to, it would be locked up for that period without any compensation whatever feeing given. In his opinion the House could not, with any degree bf respect for themselves, and regard for the well-being bf South Australia, ijarry the second reading of this BilL, It might be said, and had been said, that, modifications might be made in it ; but theymustlook at the Bill as it stood, and he would say' reject it— it should have.' been brougnt forward 'in :/a 'shape in which it could be entertained. '(BTear, hear.) He coun selled that th;e BiH should be thrown out. Then the promoters could bring in another. Tiet them - undertake to make a line from this end to Buch a point as the ^Government might approve of, and for such a work he would sup port their receiving such, 'a grant of land as would be fair and reasonable compensation. ' He was satisfied the House would be with him as to the desirableness of rejecting the Bill, and if they did throw it out he was confident the pro ceeding weuld meet with the approval of the country. The length of the line, it was sup posed, would be 2,000, but it might be much shorter than that if the most suitable route were adopted. He regretted very much that the telegraph line was taken from 'Port Augusta, He proposed that it should start from Werit worth, but his Government were beaten upon the point. He wished, however, that he had taken a stand with reference to the matter, arid gone out of office rather than given way.' It would be impossible that such a railway as proposed would pay for much more than the' oil and tar used upon it.' There would be no traffic of goods. On their lines they charged 3d. per ton per mile, and What would that amount to on a line 2,003 miles lbng^-(Mr. Lake — ' £25.')— £25, whilst goods could be conveyed to the other side ef,the cpntinent by sea for 30s. or 40s; per ton. The thing was ab-: surd on the' face of it. (Hear, hear.) Then, he would 'ask, where 'would fuel be .obtained for the ? eneines ? Did their infarmsMnis toll them that sufficient timber would be found in the interior?' In the United States it was, known that there were1 coal mines, which could be utilised for the railway. To have to ckrry coal from Port Augusta for fuel, would con siderably diminish the carrying capability of the trains; (Hear, hear.) He was confident the House would see the absurdity of the mea sure, and reject it. (Cheers.) Mt^ TOWNSEND hoped the hon. member for Gumeracha, by whom, the measure was in-, troduced, would not think that those who might object to it intended any disrespect to him. The question of the construction of a Trans continental Kail way exceeded in magnitude every other , question that had occupied their attention, .except that of State grant. In his opinion a question of such' magnitude, before action was taken, should. be remitted to those by whom they were elected to that House. (Hear, hear.); He believed the Hon. Mr. Blyth was a. painstaking public man,, but he must, when he consented to takecnarge of this Bill, have allowed his judgment to give way to his good nature. Those hon. members1 who knew. how the hon. gentleman could speak, Were struck with the listless and dull tone in which he spoke on the subject of this railway. It was clear his heart was not in the matter — indeed, he admitted himself that he had not dpne the subject justice, though he certainly improved on . the second occasion — and he doubted . whether his mind ; was made up now. He did not think he took up the matter very heartily, and he doubted very much, whether he thoroughly believed in the scheme. . There was au impres sion abroad that this was jio. proposal for the construction of the railway.; that notwithstand' ing the advertisements in the papers ; notwith standing the agencies ; notwithstanding that when Mr. Ross could not get you to go with him he almost insulted you ; notwithstanding all this he said, there was an impression that there waa no real -scheme before the public, (Hear, hear.) He regarded this as a private Bill, and thought the House ought to treat it as such. The way the list of promoters was obtained, was' this -=- two or three leading names were given, and by those other persons were, got to join, and some of 'those so secured, had since expressed regret ' that they had become promoters. It was proposed to take the railway, not from the Burra, but from Port Augusta, and 200,000,000 acres ef land were asked for. It was quite impossible the railway could- .pay, and the Hon. Mr.- Blyth never attempted to prove that it was a desirable work. But the distance in, reality was not much- more than 1,800 miles ; and he would -remind hon. members that some1 years ago aa offer was made to construct a railway from Port Augusta 200 miles north for a guarantee of 5| per cent., or £5,700 per mile, but the Legislature re fused to entertain the affair: and yet such a proposal aa that under .consideration was made; If this laud was, as represented, valueless,. should they.be justified in offering to English capitalists that which was valueless, in order to make money out of them ? (A laugh.) To offer them valueless' land woold most de cidedly be shameful conduct. But the laud, in fact, was not valueless. (Hear, hear.) If it had been this Bill would never have been before them. (Hear, hear.) The reward he hoped ?the colony would secure for the large expendi ture connected with the construction of the Overland Telegraph was that the knowledge so obtained of the country, in the - interior would' lead to much of it being opened up; He knew from . conversations with persons who had been engaged in connection with the Overland' Telegraph that the land was valuable. When he first saw Mr. Towler he. very Mghly praised the country, but the next time he saw him, singu larly enough, he. seemed: to, haw considerably changed his opinion. (A laugh.) Mr. John Rouusevell alqo .well kaew the value of 'this land ; and many people were leaving good situa tions to settle upon It, so satisfied; were; they of its value. ? j Jf this land, .was so valuable, war it advisable that it should be looked up for five years? If the Bill were passes in its present form, the Government could -not deal with one acre of the land until the five years' had ex pired. He.pledged his reputation as a valuator, .that if the Government.. were to offer -it -in-- 10.000.aore blocks, much of i$ would iring 5s. an acre - within, five yean, and somd of the promoters'bf: the present ^cheme would, he believed, be large purchasers at that pneeu It was monstrous to .ask them to part with'io much land on the/ terms proposed. . (Hejiur, hear.) Then there was the power wMci a large Company ' would . be able to exercise /arid this was well pointed but in a letter in one of gie newspapers by Mr. S. Raphael, but ' whojse views had since, he believed, undergone ibme change. (Laughter.) Were they not aware ipf the prejudicial effect of a small Company in the Districts of -Gumeracha and. Onkaparinga? ,-Tho promoters said they took the matter up in 'the interests of the colony. Would they, he asked, be contented with the return of the £100 con tributed by each, arid to take up shares in the Company proposing to carry oufi the :ui dertaking? They would not; but/ we^B desirous of selling their concession id, as to return each of them a handsome profit. /This was another instance proving that respectable men would do collectively what they!-, would not do individually. The- promoters of :lhe scheme, if they obtained the' concession, would take it to England, America, or B^Jgiumi wiiere they would Bell it for, the Vhighest-^priee ; ^hey could obtain for ifc ' He denied that he was ^at all influenced in the action he wai.taTdng iby feelings of envy ; and he would ask 'after the railway were made what would become- of t&e; people who had been employed upon it ? He was afraid that many of them would have to be kept by the State. There were three questions to be considered in connection with thisundertakine —first, was the railway necessary ? second, wbuH it pay? and, third, was the concession asked fair and reasonable? The Hon. Mr. Hart had spoken about a deposit, and, supposing the promoters put, down the whole of their capital, £11,000, what would that be? In his opinion £100,000 would not be a sufficient deposit— it should' at least be 'equal to the cost of the sur vey. He would remark that a considerable sum of money had already been spent in touting for a favorable expression of opinion from people, but, for himself he could say tnat he had nob been spoken to on the subject by any of his con stituents except those interested in the scheme. He was anxious that the Legislature should pro ceed upon the sound' political principle, that ii was riot their duty to pass a measure for ,the purposes of speculation, bat simply to.; deal with boaa fide Companies. (Hear, hear.) The promoters did not propose to bind themselves, and he considered that a contract should be binding upon both uides. (Hear, ;hear.)..JJE their action werfe really intended for the ad), vantage of the colony, he said, 'Spend your money in throwing the project open to all the world, arid don't bind ' the colony land .and Eoot, whilst you are trying^ to get the work uni vter uuteii. j a. laugp ; ana near, near. ) : , xnere were men amongst the promoters wlionj 'He would go a long way to serve, but le'feii that he should riot be doing his duty to th.o§e who sent him there if Jble gave the measure under consideration his support. He hoped those who spoke— taking the other side — would not say he was actuated, by .improper motives ; but the Bill was such that even if modified he felt that'he could net give it his support; and he therefore considered it his duty to move that the Bill be read that day six months. .He would pointout that before a white man sefhis foot in South Australia land fetched £1 an acre, and land alienated since had fetched, on. an average 25s. 6d, an acre, and land sold by private persons had averaged 50s. an acre; and yet they were told that the land through which the call way would pass was valueless. The proposal before the House was nothing less than a stock jobbing scheme. The promoters, wished to get ^ie con cession on the most favorable terras and to sett it_at the highest price they could get for it, riot with. the .view of improving the colony, because the interest of the promoters in the affair would cease when they had &old; the concession. (Cheers). . ' // Mr. CARR said the liberal land reformers must hide their diminished heads before this Bill, for they certainly never, imagined any thing one-twentieth, part so : generous as this proposal -to give more than one-third of the whole colony in fee-simple to Mr. Ross and his; friends, the promoters, for ninepence -per acre — the money to be spent iu making a railway,' which, when made, was to be the property of the promoters also, if they chose tokeepit^ What a contrast to the parsimony: with which land was deled out to the farmer at riot less than £1 per acre, was the magnificent liberality , of tlie promoters. of this scheme. : The only-' drawback was, that the land was to be taken by the promoters from the public and given ' to themselves. As for the quantity of laud being .too much, how could it be so, when Mr. SamLp Tomkinson, one of the 'promoters, said they did intend to ask f oi three hundred millions' acres, which was more than half the whole, colony, the Northern Territory included ; hut, not liking to ask too much, they came down tor? two hundred millions as the very lowest figure. ?; Yet this least quantity, which these promoters in their bashfulness and disinterested modesty jdare ask for, was more than: two-fifths of the whole colony. Sojfth Australia with its Northern Territory contained' 750,000 square miles. The promoters asked for 312,500 square miles. England contained 50,922 square^miles ; ? Wales, 7,397 ; -Scotland, 31,324 ; Ireland, 82,481 ; New Zealand, 95,000; and Victoria, 86,94*;: making a total of 304,068 square miles. These figures showed that $he promoters only asked for some five million acres beyond the -aggregate area of Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, 1 and Victoria; and they asked them in this^ Bill to promise to support the authority of the Company throughout the whole of this vast territory, and guarauteee their pro-i prietorship, with all its privileges and lights.: Ou a recent occasion, in. speaking of their request that they should hand over to them' this enormous extent of country, ne was reported ?. as using the word 'immodesty,' whereas he spok.e of the 'modesty' of the promoters in making sucu a moderate request when they^ might have asked for mere; and he now said taat the plan deposited with this Bill, showing how much land they would like to have, and. where they weuld like to have it, was a very 1 elegant plan, avoiding, as it did flo. dexterously, - all the sterile country 20Q miles north of Pori Augusta; and riot only asking for as mno^: land as would give to every man in the - colony a farm of 4,610 acres, hut also choosing the land so as to include the good - country and navigable rivers of the Nor- - them Territory. It was quite a work of art ; a but it had one fault, in that it represented the - worst half of the Amerioan fiag — the stripes without the stars — just as this scheme imitated ? the worst half of American enterprise, by trying : to give us the land monopolies, and political - jobbery, and rascalities of the Amerioan railway: ring, without the public utility and reproduo- j tiveness of American railways. It was mere ^ idle talk to compare a thing like this with sj railway connecting the Atlantic shores anijr States with the Pacific, :There they had the .' past population of the Atlantio and mpreis Western States on the one Bide, -and - the wonderful growth of the goidan State of; California on . the other. Here we had: 'ai handful of people in South Australia proper,' i and a few Government officials at Port DarV I win. There they avoided a rough arid -»». ; cuitous voyage of many thousand miles round ? Cape Horn, equal at least to a voyage half*! round the world, while here we should Compete with an ocean route- in-anjild climate ^and'. pacific seas, not more than twice as long as the' ' proposed railway. Besides this, the American :' railways were made for national purposes, te a bind the various States together in faon bonds a aud common interests at the eommon cbBt; but; - this was: a project for the benefit of a section oaly of this colony. He agreed mosfcthoroagaly ; with all that could be said as to the neoesaity -: fordeveloping the resources of the coQntry/and '- promoting internal coraanunicatiQn, but tiiey ' would laugh at Ja man who threw away the best' half of a magnificent estate, in order that W - might have aroad made through, it inthe wrong- : place.
