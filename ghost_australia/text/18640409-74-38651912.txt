THE TOWN HALL PItOI'rST. rb he Editor' of the LTunceston Examiner. Sm?,-In your issue of.yehterday there is some notico of n" protest from. the Right Iteverend Doctor Willson to his Excellency the Governor, against the progranime as issued hby his Worship the Mayor for laying the, "foundatlon, stoe of the Town Hall in tits town," on Thursday, 21st instant. It seems to me somewhat strange that in the most common and ordinary transactions of life our Roman Catholic brethren are ever at feud with os:; whether it' Is that 'w' are the'shortsighlod, thriftless, and holpless creatures which the IRight Reverend Doctor deems us, and require thus put ting to rights at every turn ; or whetiher it may not arise fromo that arrogant deslireof domination which has ever charactorised the Romnisl Chturch. This is a ilouetioa whttich ?ist shortly'be solved, for certain it is that we can do nothing now which gives satisfaction to this section of our. bethrethren. It niatters Ittile it wivat our ifforts consist, whether in the mnore serious battles of life, social nmuse ments, or,. benevoleont.instiittioes-oven to the distribution of a basin of soup In the o?timatioti of the Right Reverend Father, weonre ever astray I I shall not stop. to discuss the qpeslion in its pro sent shape, but rather proceed to seek upon what ground these people so edonsatily obtrude them selves upon us, and often in a ,shape which to me, savors ofimpertinent intrusion. If we take thi records of past ages, we shall find' little to favor' their pretensions in either secular or religiousahis tory.

I believe from close inquiry I am wlithin the: bounds of truth when I state that eight out of ten of tn tese ad victims are Roman Catholics I Now this is a most astound ing fact, and one which must strike every reader not only with astonlshment, but with a convic Iron, a burning conviction, that tllere Is- nay, must be-something wrong, fetrfully wrong, in this "most holy religion I" These are sad iltus, trations of tile calamitons results ofelther a want of proper training or radically bad training. It cannot be a mere accidental coincidence, for cause and effect are ever inviolable as a law of nature. It is barely possible that in the amiable anxieties of these holy fathers to distinguish themselves, or In their lanudable desire to be charitable, they step forward and relieve their fellow.laborers of the Anglican Church from the painful position ofad ministering the last consoling influences of a re ligiol with whose spirit they are not embuetd, and therefore don't undersitond.
