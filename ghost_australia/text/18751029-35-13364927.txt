THE ARCTIC EXPEDITION. I By the arrival of the Valorous at Plymouth, on the 29th August, the Western Morning News has received the following letter from the correspondent on board the Discovery - It is June 21, and we are still between 300 and 400 miles from Cape 1 arrived Up to the present time, excepting the fair wind which cleared us of the Channel and all its dangers, we have experienced head winds and hard gales No light summer breeze to be aft us across the Atlantic ? No, we started to mt made the most sacred territory of Nature, and in stead of remaining quietly at home till we had dined at the threshold of her jealously-guarded domain, she has met and opposed us from the very start ivitliMuue pretty strong head winds and a gale or two but still we have got on little by little, and shall soon now, I hope, reach Disco by the 1st of July, which is the date we wish to arrive there-that is not later than that date, and I only hope that these same winds that have been doing so much to stop our advance may be blowing with equal strength in Smith b Sound and Melville Bay, and then, far from doing us any harm, the) will be doing us the utm st good There is nothing that could help us mun, in which he should have more wished for We left Bantry Bay on Wednesday), June 2, about 11 am The Valorous was waiting for us just out side, and having joined her we all proceeded together under bail, the tv and, what there tins of it, being our By the morning it was quite calm, so steam was got up, but soon after a breeze springing up to; us we made sail The poor old Yralorous could hardly keep up with us, even by using steam (slow spin 1) in addition to her tail YY I had to keep under smb. case said that he rolled a great deal more than Unie ty is any need for At last, on the evening of M our day, 6th, Y uloious was informed by signal station the present we would believe ourself s of her come in, but that she was to he lit Disco by July 1 YVe accordingly ran on and s "u lost sight of her However, we saw her again in the distance for one or two days after as the vvuuK were light and iambic and she used Steam 11) Wednesday), the 9th, we had reduced the distance to Cape Farewell From 129 miles, which is I think about the distance from Bantry Uni, to 800 miles but on Wednesday a foul mud set in after our hatstand,, one and by Saturday, 12th, we had brought the distance up to 82 miles, having been driven to the southward On Sunday, at noon, we were 778 miles off having made on our course 22 miles in four days there was too much wind and sea all that time for us to use steam, let alone the it rate of coal. On hand i) 11th, our last real tale commenced, at about 4 ft in the wind came from the westward, blowing pretty fresh up till 7am, w hen it very suddenly increased, and continued doing so until about 11 pm, when it blew its hardest There was a very rapid fall of the barometer as we stood to the northward, the fall increasing in rapidity as we approached the centre of the star n for by the rapidly falling barometer, the confused state of the sea, the heavy and violent squalls, At the knew he here in a circular storm This is an ed him to get on the other tack, as it is not desirable to get into the centre of a circular storm So at about 12 30 pm we tv ore, the wind shifted as we ethel so about five points We now. stood away to the we st wild The barometer commenced rising aim is in mediately, but the wind did not go down much till Tuesday morning, and by the evening it to us calm from the 13th till the 27th we had a sure s bion of hard head as inds, with short enters its of cj iii during which intervals we steamed The ship at a pretty net, making in a great deal of water, ot win li to our great disgust, a large amount for all its way below On the 27th the time upon our first ice, heavy pack, along which we skirted, sometimes getting into it, until the 1st July, on which day we saw the last of the floe amid pack ice on this side of Disco During this time we had seen only a few bergs, and those not at all large ones July 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, were three for Jv days We were steering to the north, along the laid about thirty or forty miles off the coast line c in tists of a rugged mountain chain running north and south, the tops and sides of which were covered with snow in many places, but whether unusually so 01 not we cannot tell The coast line was broken with numerous inlets and deep fjords running far mia of the sea was beautifully blue and quite calm and the sun shining brightly made the mountain sides and tops glisten and sparkle like diamonds, w Inch i r viv dink, snowless patches helped to show out ill he more brilliantly Here and there a few nth runs out at sea broke the uniformity of honour in that direction In fact, except that the au v is a rather too told, it was easy to no line oneself in the Mediterranean As we approached the Isbn I of Disco icebergs became much more numerous, and we saw some very large one, but still, especially in height, nothing to what I expect we shall see On Sunday, 4th in the evening, we crossed the AitticCncle met on Monday the sum vi is shining brightly all night It seems very odd going to bed in the bright sunlight On Tuesday, the 6th we inn v ed and authored at Goilhuxn, Ditto, where we found the "\ odorous She got in on Sunday, thanks to her power of steam, in spite of our calling her alumina, "it at first She came through home ice, but not so much as we did having kept more to the east ward she Ins 250 tons of coal left, at between us we shall take from her something like 120 or 1 30 tons, so I expect they will hut to go to a place on the mainland called Ititenba is just opposite Disco and dig for coal, which will 1> a long, disagreeable job, as the ground must still be very hard from the frost, and the coal is so bad t i it the Danish Government sends out every year the t me required for the settlements However, as lone i they get enough to clear them of the ice on the by as to Cape 1 Grevell, and for the sounding mid dredg n they have to do on their way home, it will do, is I tv tan sail the rest of the time On Sunday, the 11th J record that we have been hard at work ever since u arrival at Disco getting of coal and stores from us Valorous, and taking observations of nil dcscripU n on shore, the naturalists making excursions i t flowers, &c; There are a good many different kinds of plants and flowers growing on the side of the mountains, but not in any very great abunda! There are, except dogs, no animals on this island, is not many birds, some ducks have been a hot-air i but not many There are a few need to be caught the harbour, and some salmon trout in the rivers is not many of either, still, they are very acceptable n supplementing our other provisions there was a little excitement about some met 01 lies the other day A place near here in "J) lord, called Of take is celebrated for it though there are none now a Swedish FroM having carried them all off a few years ago YY c some Esquimaux came in and said that it I I near there, fishing or something a dat i so before, they had seen some " meteorite fall, and marked the spot A party's beat off at once on the evening of the 9th to try and find them, and see if it was possible to see them to the ship, the next morning the steam space of the Valorous also went to look for it The expedition returned last night without him seen the ghost of a ' meteorite, though the Ls i i manx pointed out the exact spot where he had seen it.

I After leaving Ritenbank, we shall go north, through the "Waigattet Channel between Disco and the "West Coast of Green- land-looking in at Upernivik, where we may leave letters, and then across Melville Bay, up Smith Sound, and so on. "We shall leave eight depots of provisions between the Carey Islands and eighty-two degrees N. latitude, to fall back upon, in the event of our having finally to abandon our ships; but I hope we shall bring back one, anyhow. To-day (July 16) we arrived and anchored at Baton bank at 11 a.m., and we leave at 6 a.m. to-morrow morning, just giving ourselves time to get the dogs and take a few observations. Our letters go to-night by the Valorous ; so I must conclude now. We had a very quiet trip across here, and I think we shall find the towing to be economical, but it has not had a fair trial yet. To reach this place we had to cross the mouth of the "Wmgnttet, up which we go to-morrow. It was pretty to look at: a long, narrow, winding-channel-it is about eight miles broad and eighty long-running up between rugged mountains, snow-crowned, but the sides of which were dark and steep, with a few patches of green and snow. The water was a most beautiful blue, and was dotted all over with quantities of icebergs of all sizes, through which to-morrow we shall have to wind in and out on our way to the north. This is a settlement of about the same size as God have, situate on a small island just off the land, and between which and the land is a narrow deep channel, up which we came and anchored in a small fjord just to the northward of the settlement, and running a short distance into the main land ; the water very deep close to the shore. Since our arrival in the Arctic regions everything has been most favourable and if we can only carry this beautiful weather through Melville Hay we shall rise. We are sending no invalids home in fact, we rltm't know what sickness means, and the doctors are able to turn their attention entirely to scientific pursuits, I think by the time we return that we shall have acquired a great deal of information on many things up here of which little or nothing is known at present As we go along we correct the charts as much as possible, particularly at any place where we anchor, when theodolite and sextants and compasses go ashore at once.
