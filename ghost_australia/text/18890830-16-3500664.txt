PARLIAMENTARY RIFLE MATCH. A friendly match between the Parliamentary rifle clubs of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, New Zealand, and Queensland, was held simultaneously in each colony yesterday morning. The match is the first of its kind which has taken place, and it was brought about at the suggestion of South Australia. The weather was rather dull for rifle shooting at the Toowong range, but on the whole the Queensland club scored well. The hon, A. J. Thynne made the highest number of points, his shooting at the 100 yards range being exceptionally good, as he scored 361 points out of a possible 38, while in the two sighting shots he hit the bull's-eye each time. The shooting took place at Toowong, and the result was wired to the Southern colonies and to New Zealand. Up to the present time the results of the shooting in the other colonies have not been received by the Queensland club. The following are the scores of the Queensland team :- * too COO COO Yds. Yds.
