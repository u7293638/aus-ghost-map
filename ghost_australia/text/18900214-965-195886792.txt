An Oeean Tragedy. Br W. CLARK RUSSELL. CHAPTER XIV.—continued. MUFFIN GOES FOBWAED. HE turned on his heel, shaking with laughter, and walked up to Finn, to whom I heard him tell the whole story, though repeatedly interrupting himself with a jerky, noisy shout of merriment. He asked the skipper what work he could put Muffin to, and Finn rumbled out a long answer, but they stood at too great a distance to enable me to catch all that was said. Presently Finn put his head into the companion hatchway and called.- After a little Muffin emerged. Wilfrid recoiled when he saw the man, turned his back upon him, and stepped hastily right aft past the wheel. I whispered to Miss Jennings, "Did you mark that? Each will go in terror of the other now, I suppose ; Wilfrid because he thinks Muffin mad, and Muffin because he thinks that Wilfrid, should he get to hear the truth, will shoot him." "This way, my lad," cried Finn in a Cape Horn voice, and a half smile that twisted the hole in the middle of his long visage till it looked like the mouth of a plaice. They both went forward and disappeared. The sailors who were at work about the deck stared hard at Muffin as he passed them, shrewedly guessing that something unusual had happened, and not a little astonished to observe the cap* tun conducting him between decks to the mariners' parlour. Soon the skipper came up, and called to a large, burly, heavily-whiskered man, who, as I had gathered, was a sort of acting boatswain, though I believe he had not signed in that capacity, but had been appointed by Finn to oversee the crew as being tha most experienced sailor on board. The skipper bilked with him, and the heavilywhiskered man nodded vehemently with a broad smile that compressed his face into a thousand wrinkles, under the rippling of which his little eyes seemed to founder altogether. Then Finn came aft, and Wilfrid and he fell to pacing the deck. Miss Jennings read; I smoked occasionally, giving her an excuse to leave her book by asking a question, or uttering some .commonplace remark. I was lying back in my easy, lounging deck-chair, with my eyes sleepily following the languid sweep of the maintopmast-head, where the truck showed like a circle of hoar frost against the airy blue that floated in its soft, cool bright tint to the edges of the sails whose brilliant whiteness seemed to overflow the bolt ropes and frame them with a narrow band of pearlcoloured film, when Miss Jennings suddenly exclaimed, "Oh, Mr. Monson, do look!" I started, and following the direction of her gaze, spied Muffin standing near the galley rigged out as a sailor. There may have been a slop-chest on board—I cannot tell; perhaps Finn had borrowed the clothes for the fellow from one of the seamen; anyway there stood Muffin divested of his genteel frock coat, his gentlemanly cravat and black cloth unmentionables, and equipped in a sailors jacket of that period, a coarse coloured shirt, rough dock or canvas breeches, whose bellshaped extremities entirely concealed his gouty ankles. His head was protected by a nautical straw hat, somewhat battered, with one long ribbon floating down his back, under the brim of which his yellow face showed with the primrose tincture of the Chinaman, whilst his dead black eyes, gazing languishingly our way, looked the deader and blacker for the pl&ister-like; streak of hair that lay along his brow as though one of the Jacks had scored a line there with a brush steeped in liquid pitch. "Heavens, what an actor the fellow would make!" said 1, the laugh that seemed to have risen to my throat lying checked there by wonder and even admiration of the astonishing figure the man cut in his new attire. The burly, heavily-' whiskered salt rolled up to him. What Muffin said I could not hear, but there was the air of a respectful bow in the posture of his odd form, and my ear easily imagined the oily tone of his replies to the huge sailor. They crossed to the other side of the deck out of sight. Shortly afterwards I left my seat to join Wilfrid, and then the first object that I beheld on the port side of the vessel was Muffin washing the side of the galley, with a bucket of water at his feet and the heavily-whiskered man looking on. Well, thought I, rounding on my heel with a laugh, 'twill make home the sweeter to him when he gets there, and, meanwhile, Wilfrid will be free from all further phosphoric visitations. CHAPTER XV. I BOABD A WEECK. THE time slipped by. Life is monotonous at sea, and, though the days seemed to have speeded quickly past when one looks back, they appear to be- crawling along on all-fours when one looks ahead. We sighted nothing that carried the least resemblance to the vessel we were in chase of. Within a week we spoke two ships, both Englishmen, one a fine tall black clipper craft from Sydney, New South Wales, full of Colonials bound to the Old Country for a cruise amongst the sights there ; the other, a little north-country brig, laden down to her chain plates, in charge of the very tallest man I ever saw in my life—this side, I mean, of the giants who go on show—with a roaring voice tiiat smote the ear like the blast of a discharged piece; but neither vessel gave us any news of the Shark, no craft of the kind had been sighted or heard of by either of them. It was as I expected. For my part, the adventure remained a most ridiculous undertaking, and never more so than when I thought of the speck a ship made in the vast blue eye of the wide ocean. We fell in with some handsome breezes for travelling, several of which drove us through it in thunder, with a hill of foam on either quarter and an acre of creaming white spreading under the chaste golden beauty the yicht carried on her stemhead. The vind flashed blue into the violet hollows of the canvas, the curves of whose round breasts shone out past the shadowings to the sun, and rang splitting upon the iron taut rigging of the driven craft with joyous hunting-notes in its echoings as though the chase were in view and there were spirits in the air hallaoing us into a madder speeding. Wilfrid and Finn and I hung over the chart, calculating with sober faces, finding our position to be there, and then there, and then there, till we worked out an average speed from the hour of our departure that caused the skipper to swear, if the Shark was not already astern of us, she could not be very far ahead, unless a great luck of wind had befallen her; a conjecture scarce fair to put down as a basis to build our figures upon, since it was a hundred to one that her fortune in the shape of breezes had been ours. For, be it remembered, we were in a well-scoured ocean; the winds even north of the "rains" and "horse latitudes" were in a sense to be reckoned on, with the trades beyond as steady in their way as the indication of a jammed dog vane, and the " doldrums " to follow—the equinoctial belt of catspaws and molten calms, where one sailor's chance was another's the wide world round. But reasoned Finn, and I was not there to say him nay; yet it was difficult to hear him without a sort of mental shrug of the shoulders, though it was a talk to smooth down the raven plume of Wilfrid's melancholy " till it smiled." My cousin managed very well without his valet, protested indeed that he felt easier in his spirits since the fellow had gone forward, as though all unconsciously to himself he had long been depressed by the funeral face of the man. "Besides," said he, in his simple knowing way, with a quivering of the lids that put an expression of almost idiot cunning into the short, pathetic peering of his large, protruding eyes, "he was with me when my wife left my home; he it was who came to tell me that Lady Monson was not to be found; it was he, too, who put Hope-Kennedy's letter into my hand though it was picked up by one of the housemaids. These were thoughts that would float like a cloud of hellish smoke in my brain when he was hanging about me, and so I'm glad to have him out of my sight; yes, I'm the better for his absence. And then," he added, lowering his voice, " his behaviour proves that he is not sound in his mind." That Muffin was as well content with the arrangement as his master I cannot say. They kept him at work forward upon small mean jobs, and he Beldom came aft unless it was to lend a hand in pulling upon a rope. Yet after a little 1 would see him in a dog-watch on the forecastle with a huddle of seamen on the broad grin round him. One special evening I remember when the watch had run out into the dusk, and it might have been within half-an-hour of eight bells, 1 arrived on deck from the dinner table end heard, as I supposed, a woman singing forward. The voice was a very good clear soprano, with a quality in it that might have made you imagine a middle-aged lady was tuning up. The song was "The Yale of Avoca." The concertina accompaniment was fairly played. I listened with astonishment, for some time wondering whether Miss Jennings' maid had got among the men, and than called to Crimp— " Who's that singing 1" said I. "Him they've nick-named the mute," said he. "mat, Muffin?" "Ay! sounds as if he'd swallowed his sister and she was calling out to be re- There happened inside this particular week with which I am dealing an incident much too curious not to deserve a place here. All day long it had been blowing a fresh breeze from north-east, but as the sun sank the wind went with him and about an hour before sunset there was a mild air breathing with scarce weight enough in it to blow the scent off a milkmaid, as sailors say, though it was giving the yacht way as you saw by the creep of the wrinkles at her stem working out from the shadow of the yacht's form in the water into lines that resembled burnished copper wire in the red western light. Miss Laura and Wilfrid were on deck, and I was leaning over the rail with a pipe in my mouth, all sorts of easy, dreamy fancies slipping into ine out of the drowsy passage of the water alongside with its wreath of foam bells eddying or some little cloudy seething of white striking from our wet and flashing side into a surface which hung so glass-like with the crimson tinge in the atmosphere sifting down into it that you fancied you could see a hundred fathoms deep. Presently running my eyes ahead I caught sight of some minute object three or four points away on the weather bow, which every now and again would sparkle like the leap of a flame from the barrel of a musket. I stepped to the companion, picked up the telescope and made the thing out to be a bottle, the glass of which gave back the sunlight in fitful winkings to the twists and turns of it upon the ripples. "What are you looking at?" cried Wilfrid. "A bottle," I answered. "Ho!" he laughed, "what you sailors call a dead marine, ha? What sort of liquor will it have contained, 1 wonder, and how long has it been overboard 1" The glass I held was Captain Finn's; it was a very powerful instrument, and the bottle came so close to me in the lenses f ' that it was like examining it at arm's length. " It is corked," said I. "Can we not pick it up?" exclaimed Miss Jennings. "Oh, but an empty bottle, my dear," exclaimed Wilfrid, with a shrug. I examined it again. "I tell you what, Wilfrid; that it is corked should signify there is something in it. Who troubles himself to plug an empty bottle when it is flung overboard unless it is intended as He was instantly excited. "Why, by all means then ,"he broke off, looking round. The mate had charge; ho was sulkily pacing the deck to leeward with a lift of his askew eye aloft and then a stare • over the rail, all as regular as the recurrence of rhymes in poetry. "Mr. Crimp," called Wilfrid. The man came over to us. "Do you see that bottle?" Crimp shaded his eyes and took a steady view of the water towards which my cousin pointed, and then said, "Is that there thing flashing a bottle i " "Yes, man; yes." " Well, I see it right enough." "Get it picked up, Mr. Crimp," said Wilfrid. The mate walked aft. "Down helium," he exclaimed to the fellow who was steering. The wheel was put over and the bottle was brought almost directly in a line with the yacht. The topgallantsail " lifted," but what air blew was abaft the beam, and the distance was too short to render necessary the handling of the braces and sheets. Crimp went a little way forward and hailed the forecastle, and presently a man stood ready at the gangway with a canvasbucket slung at the end of a line. A very small matter will create a great deal of interest at sea. Had the approaching bottle been a mermaid the group of sailors could not have observed it with livelier attention nor awaited its arrival with brisker expectations. Presently splash! the bottle was cleverly caught, hauled up, dried, and brought aft. " It's not been in the water long," said I; " the wooden plug in the moutli looks fresh." " Mr. Crimp, sing out fear a corkscrew," cried Wilfrid. "No good in that," cried I; "break the thing, that will be the speediest way to come at its contents." I held the bottle to the sun a moment, but the glass was thick and black and revealed nothing. I then knocked it against the rail, the neck fell and exposed a letter folded as you double a piece of paper to light your pipe with. I pulled it out and opened it; Miss Laura peeped over one shoulder, Wilfrid over the other, his respirations swift, almost tierce. It was just the thing to put some wild notions about the Shark into his head. From the forecastle the sailors were staring with all their eyes. The paper was quite diy; I opened it carefully with an emotion of awe, for trifling as the incident was apparently, yet to my fancy there was the mystery and the solemnity of the ocean in it too. Indeed, you thought of it as having something of the wonder of a voice speaking from the blue air when your eye sought the liquid expanse out of whose vast heart the tiny missive had been drawn. It was a rude hurried scrawl in lead pencil, and ran thus:— " Brig Colossus. George Meadows, Captain. Waterloggedjive days—all haiids but two are dead; fast breaking up. No fresh water. Raw pork one cask. Who finds {his for God's sake report." The word September was added, but the writer had omitted the date, probably could not remember it after spelling the name of the month. I gave Crimp the note that he might take it forward and read it to the men, telling him to let me have it again. "They will all have perished by this time, no doubt," said Wilfrid in his most raven-like note. " Think of them with raw pork only! The meat crystallised with salt, the hot sun over their heads, not a thimbleful of fresh water, the vessel going to pieces plank by plank, the horrible anguish of thirst made maddening by the mockery of the cold fountain-like sounds of that brine there flowing in the hold or washing alongside with a cliampagne-like seething. Oh!" groaned I, " whoisthathome-keeping bard who speaks of the ocean as the mother of all ? The mother ? A tigress! Why, if old Davy Jones be the devil, Jack is right in finding an abode for him down on the ooze there. Mark how the affectionate mother of all torments its victims with a hellish refinement of cruelty before strangling them ! how—if the land be near enough—die will fling them ashore, mutilated, eyeless, eaten, in horrid triumph and enjoyment of her work, that we shuddering radishes may behold and understand her power." "Ceasefor God's sake! roared Wilfrid. " You're talking a nightmare, man. Isn't the plain fact enough?" he cried, picking up the broken bottle and flinging it in a kind of rage overboard, " why garnish ?" " I want to see the ocean properly interpreted," I cried. " Your poetical personifications are claptrap. Great mother, indeed 1 Great grandmother, Wilfrid. Mother of whales and sharks, but when it comes to man—" "Oh, but this is impiety, Mr. Monson," cried Miss Laura, "it is really dangerous to talk so. One may think—but here we are upon the sea, you know, and that person you spoke of just now (pointing dovrn) might with his great ears—" " Now, Laura, my dear," broke in Wilfrid, " can't we pick up a wretched bottle and read the melancholy message it contains without falling ill of fancy ? " He went to the skylight—"Steward, some seltzer and brandy here. Your talk of that salt pork," he continued, coming back to us, "makes my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth. I would give much for a little ice, d'ye know. Heigho ! big as this ocean is, I vow by the saints' there's not room enough in it for the misery there is in the world," with which he set off pacing the deck, though he calmed down presently over a foaming glass ; but he showed so great a dislike to any reference to the bottle and its missive that, to humour him, Miss Jennings and I forbore all allusion to the incident. It was next forenoon, somewhere about the hour of eleven o'clock, that the lookout man on the topgallantyard—whom I had noticed playing for some time the polished tubes, which glanced like fire in his lifted hands as he steadied the glass against the mast—suddenly bawled down with a voice of excitement, " Sail ho ! " Wilfrid, who was lounging on the skylight, jumped off it; I pricked up my ears; Miss Laura hollowed her gloved hands to take a view of the man aloft. " Where away ? " cried Finn. " Right ahead, sir." " What do you make her out to be ? " The seaman levelled the telescope again, then swinging off from the yard by his grip of the tie, he sung out, "She looks to be a wrcck, sir. I don't make out any canvas set." " She'll be showing afore long, your honour," said Finn, and he cast his eye upon the water to judge of our speed. All night long it had blown a weak wind, and the draught was still a mere aiming, with a hot sun, that made the shelter of the awning a necessary condition of life on deck by day; a clear, soft, dark blue sky westwards, and in the east a broad shadowing of steam-like cloud with a hint in the yellow tinge of it low down upon the sea of the copp.er sands of Africa, roasting noons and shivering midnights, fever and cockroaches, and stifling cabins. So that, merely wrinkling through it as we were, it was not until we had eaten our lunch, bringing the hour to about a quarter before two o'clock, that the vessel sighted from aloft in the morning had risen above the rim of the ocean within reach of a glass directed at her over the quarterdeck rail. "It will be strange," said I, putting down the telescope after a long stare at her, "if yonder craft don't prove the Colossus. Look at her, Wilfrid. A completer wreck never was." He seized the glass. "By George, then," he cried, " if that's so the two men that paper spoke of may be still alive. I hope so, I hope so. We owe heaven a life, and it iB a glorious thing to succour the perishing." TTia hand Bhook with excitement as he directed the glass at the vessel. Points of her stole out as we approached. She had apparently been a brig. Both masts were gone flush with the deck, bowsprit too, channels torn from their strong fastenings, and whole lengths of bulwark smashed level. I supposed her cargo to have been timber, but her decks showed bare, whence 1 gathered that she was floating on some other sort of light cargo —oil, cork ; no telling what indeed. She swayed wearily upon the long ocean heave with a sulky, sickly dip from side to side, as though sne rocked herself in her pain. There was a yard, or spar, in the water alongside of her, the rigging of which had hitched itself in some way about the rail, so that to every lurch on one side the boom rose half its length, with a flash of the sun off the wet end of it, and this went on regularly, till after watching it a bit I turned my eyes away with a shudder, feeling in a sense of creeping that possessed me for an instant, the sort of craziness that would come into a dying brain aboard the craft to the horrible maddening monotony of the rise and fall of that spar. " Such a picture as that," whispered Bliss Jennings softly in my ear, " realises your idea of the ocean as a tigress. But what claws could have torn her so ? And that soft caressing of the water—is it not the velvet paw stroking the dead prey ?" " There's a man on board ! " cried Wilfrid wildly ; " look, Charles." He thrust the glass into my hand whilst he pointed with a vehement gesture. I had missed him before, but the broadside opening of the wreck to our approach disclosed his figure as he sat with folded arms and his chin on his breast in a sleeping posture against the companion that remained intact, though the wheel, skylight, and all other deck fixtures that one could think of were gone. I eyed him steadily through the lenses, but though he never raised his head nor stirred his arms, which lay folded, yet owing to the roll of the hulk it was impossible to say that his body did not move. "There's the word Colossus," said I, painted plainly enough upon her bow. Yonder may be the writer of the letter received. Wilf, you should send a boat. He may be alive—God knows! But though lie be dead there might be another living." "Finn, cried Wilfrid, "bring the yacht to a stand and board that wreck instantly, d'ye hear ? " "Ay, ay, sir." "I'll make one of the boat's crew with your good leave, captain," I sung out. "Take charge by all means, Charles," said Wilfrid. " With pleasure," said I. " See two things in the boat) Finn, before we Btart —fresh water and a drop of brandy or rum." The yacht's topsail was backed, the helm put down and the vessel's way arrested. We came to a halt within halfa-mile of the wreck. The ocean swung smoothly in wide-browed folds that went brimming to the hulk in rounds polished enough at times to catch the image of her till she showed as she leaned from us with her reflection leaning too as if she had broken in halves and was foundering. The boat was lowered and brought to the gangway ; I jumped in and we shoved off. Five fellows pulled, and on a sudden I had to turn my head away to smother a laugh whilst I seemed to wave a farewell to Wilfrid and Miss Laura on noting that one of the rowers was no less a man than Muffin. Whether he had thrust himself into this errand to some thirst for any momentary change in the discipline of his shipboard life, or whether Finn had remembered that the fellow talked much of being able to feather an oar and had ordered him into the boat, I cannot tell, but there he was, as solemn as a sleeping ape, his old straw hat pulled down to his nose, and his eyes steadfastly fixed upon the oar that he plied. He pulled well enough, but his anxiety to keep time and to feather besides was exceedingly absurd, and it cost me no small effort to master my face, though the struggle to look grave and ignorant of his presence was mightily helped in a minute by the sight of the silent figure seated upon the wreck's deck. I earnestly overhauled with my eyes the wallowing fabric as we approached her, but, saving that lonely man motionless in his posture of slumber, there was nothing to be distinguished outside the melancholy raffle of unrove rigging and ropes' ends in the bow, vast rents in the planks of the deck, splinters of bulwark, stanchion, and the like. The fellow that pulled stroke was the big-whiskered man that acted as boatswain, named Cutbill. I said to him, as he came stooping towards me for the sweep of his oar, "She's so jagged the whole length of her broadside, that I believe her stern, low as it lies, will be the easiest and safest road to enter by." He looked over his shoulder, and said, " Ay, sir. But there is no need for you to trouble to step aboard. I'll overhaul her if you like, sir." " No, I'll enter her. It's a break, Mr. CutbilL But you will accompany me, for I may want help." He shook his head. " You'll find nothing living there, sir." " No telling till we've found out, anyway, said 1. " Oars ! " I sung out. We floated under the wreck's counter, hooked on, and, waiting for the lift of the swell, I very easily sprang from the boat's gunwale to the taffrail of the hulk, followed by Cutbill. The decks had blown up, and the sort of drowning rolling of the hulk rendered walking exceedingly dangerous. The water showed black through the splintered chasms, with a dusky gleam in the swaying of it like window-glass on a dark night; and there was a strange noise of sobbing that was desperately startling, with its commingling of sounds like human groans, and hollow frog-like croakings, followed by blows against the interior caused by floating cargo driven against the side, as if the hull was full of halfstrangled giants struggling to pound their way out of her. From the first great gap I looked down through I remember recoiling with a wildness that might easily have rolled me overboard to the sight of a bloated human face, with long hair streaming, floating on the surface of the water athwart the ragged orifice. It was like putting one's eye to a camera obscura and witnessing a sickening phantom of death, saving that here the horror was real, with the weeping noises in the hold to help it, and the great encompassing sea to sweep it into one's very soul as a memory to ride one's sleepless hours hag-like for a long term. We approached the figure of tho man. He was seated on a three-legged stool, with his back resting against the companion. I stooped to look at his face. "Famine is the artist here!" I cried instantly, springing erect. "My God! what incomparable anguish is there in that expression!" "See, sir," cried tho burly sailor by my side in a broken voice, and he pointed to a piece of leather that lay close beside the body. One end of it had been gnawed into pulp, which had hardened into iion again to the air and the sun. " Yet the letter we picked up," said I, "stated there was a cask of raw meat on board." " That was chewed for thirst, sir—for thirst, sir!" exclaimed the seaman. " I suffered once, and bit upon a lump of lead to keep the saliva running." "Best not linger," said I. "Take a look forward, will you? " Hewenttowards theforecastle; Ipeered down the little companion-way; it was as black as the inside of a well, with the water washing up the steps within reach of my arm. There could be nothing living down there, nor, indeed, in any other part of the wreck if not on deck, for she was full of water. The men in the boat astern were standing up in her, with their heads bobbing together over the line of the taffrail to get a view of the figure, for it was seated on the starboard side, plain in their sight, all being clear to the companion; yet, spite of that lump of whiskered, mahogany faces, with Muffin's yellow chops in the heart of it to make the whole group as commonplace as a sentence of his, never in all my time did so profound a sense of desolation and loneliness possess me as I stood bringing my eyes from the huge steeping plain of the sea to that human shape with its folded arms and its bowed head. Heavens, thought I, what scenes of human anguish have the ocean stars looked down upon! The flash past of the ghastly face in the hold beneath—that bit of grawed leather, which even had you thought of a dog coming to such a thing, would have made your heart sick—the famine in that bowed face, where yet lay so fierce a twist of torment that the grin of it made the slumberous attitude a horrible sarcasm— " Nothing to be seen, sir," exclaimed Cutbill, picking his way aft with the merchantman's clumsy, rolling step. I went in a hurry to the taffirail and dropped into the boat, he followed, and the fellow in the bow shoved off. Scarce, however, had the men dropped their oars into the rowlocks, each fellow drawing in his breath for the first stretch back, when a voice hailed us from the deck— "For God's salie don't leave me!" " Oh! " shrieked Muffin, springing to his feet and letting his oar slide over- board ; " there's someone alive on board!" '' Sit, you lubber!" thundered the fellow behind him, fetching him a chip on the shoulder that brought hiin in a crash to his hams, whilst the men abaft picked up the oar. Eveiy face wore an expression of consternation. Cutbill's, that looked like a walnut shell between his whiskers, turned of aii ashen hue; he had stretched forth his arms to give the oar its first swing, atld now they forked out paralysed into the stiffness of marline-spikes by astonishment. "Smite my eyes," he muttered as though Whispering to himself, "if it ain't the first dead man's Voice i"ever heard." "Backwater!'' I cried out, for the swell had sheered the boat so as to put the companion way betwixt us and the figure. I stood up and looked. The man was seated as before, though spite of the sure and dreadful expression of death his famine-white face bore, spite of my being certain in my own mind that he was as dead as the creature whose face had glimmered out upon the black water in the hold, ydt the cry to us had been so unmistakablyreal, had come so unequivocally, hot indeed only from the wreck, but from the very part of the hulk on which the corpse was seated, that I found myself staring at him as though I expected that he would look round at us. "There's no one alive yonder, men," said I, seating myself afresh. "What was it that spoke, think 'ee, sir?" exclaimed the man in the bow, bringing his eyes full of awe away from the sheer hulk to my face. "Mr. Monson, sir, I'umblybeg pardon," exclaimed Muffin, in the greasy deferential tone he was used to employ when in the cabin, "but there must be something living on board that ship, unless it were a sperrit." "A spirit, you fool!" cried I in a passion, "what d'ye mean by such talk? There's nothing living on that wreck, I tell you. Jump aboard anyone of you who doubts me and he can judge for himself." Muffin shook his head; the others writhed uneasily on the thwarts of the boat. "Cutbill and I overhauled the vessel; she's full of water. What is on her deck you can see for yourself, and nothing but a fish could live below. Isn't that right, Cutbill?" "Ay, sir," he answered; and then under his breath, "but what voice was it that hailed us then?" "Come, give way!" I cried, "they'll be growing impatient aboard the yacht." The oars dipped, feathered, flashed, and in an instant the blue sides of the smart and sparkling little craft were buzzing and spinning through it in foam. It was like coming from a graveyard to the sight of some glittering, cheerful, tender poetic pageant to cairy the eye from the hull to the yacht. She seemed clad by the contrast with new qualities of beauty. You found the completest expression of girlish archness in the curtsying of her shapely bows, with a light at her forefoot like a smile on the lip when she lifted her yellow sheatlung there, pouting, as one might say, from the caressing kiss of the blue brine, to gleam like gold for a moment to the sunlight. We swept alongside and I sprang on board. "The poor creature is dead, 1 suppose?" exclaimed Wilfrid, inspecting the wreck through a binocular glass. "Yes," I answered, "dead as the deiid can be; too dead to handle, faith. I might have sought in his pockets for some hiflts to found a report upon, but his face had the menace of a fierce whisper." "It seems cruel to leave him unburied," said Miss Laura, with her soft eyes full of pity, and the emotions begotten of the presence of death. "That hulk must soon go to pieces, said I, "and then she will give him a sailor's funeral." "When nature acts the part of high priestess, if there be such a part," exclaimed Wilfrid, in a low, tremulous voice, not without a kind of sweetness in its way, thanks, perhaps, to the mood of tender sentiment that was upon him, "how grandly she celebrates the humblest sailor's obsequies! how noble is her cathedral! Observe the altitude of that stupendous roof of blue. How sublime are the symphonies of the wind; how magnificent the organ notes which they send pealing through tliis great echoing fabric! Nature will give yonder poor fellow a nobler funeral than it is in our power to honour him with. But Charles," he cried, with a sudden change of voice, and indeed with a new manner in hip, "have you ever remarked the exquisite felicity with which nature invents and fits and works her puppet shows? Take yonder scene at which we have been suffered to steal a peep. What could be more choicely imagined than that a dead man should have charge of such a dead ship as that, and that the look-out he is keeping upon her deck should be as black as the future of the vessel he still seems to command?" "Well, well," said I, "all this may be as you put it, Wilf. But all the same, I am glad to see that topsail-yard swung and that spectre there veering astern. 1 protest my visit has made me feel as though I must lie down for a bit;" and, in sober truth, the body I had inspected, coupled with the thrill of amazement that had shot through me to the voice we had heard, had proved a trifle too much for my nerves, topped, as it all was, with certain superstitious stirrings, the crawling, as it might be, upon the memory of that ghostly, insoluble hail, along with the workings of an imagination that was too active for happiness when anything approaching to a downright horror fell in its way. So I went below and lay upon a sofa, but had scarcely hoisted my legs when Wilfrid arrived, bawling to the steward for a bottle of champagne^ and immediately after came Miss Jennings, who must needs fetch me a pillow, and then, as though she had a mind to make me feel ridiculous, saturate a pocket handkerchief with eau de Cologne, all which attentions I hardly knew whether to like or not till, having swallowed a bumper of champagne, I hopped off the couch with a laugh. "A pretty sailor I am, eh, Wilfrid?" cried I; "a likely sort of figure to take command of the Channel Fleet. Miss Jennings, your eau de Cologne has entirely cured me." "What's to be the next incident now— the Sharkl" exclaimed Wilfrid. He thrust his hands deep into his trousers pocket and marched into bis cabin, head hanging down. CHAPTER XVI. WE SIGHT A SCH00NEB-YACHT. I HAttfiSED to be alone on deck after dinner, having left Wilfrid at his diary and Miss Jennings in her cabin, where she had gone to make ready to join me, as she had said. The wreck had faded out before sundown, melting upon the flashing purple under the sinking luminary like the memory of a nightmare off a mind upon Which is streaming a light of cheerfulness. The night was dear but dark, with a pleasant wind through whose dryness the stars looked down purely. The yacht was sailing a fair six knots, as I gathered when I steppedfrom the companion to the lee-rail and peered over in a wool-gathering way at the emerald gushings and eddyings of the phosphoric fires which winked in the cloudy paleness along the bends, and fled into the dimness of glow-worms to the spectral racing of our wake. I was worried and oppressed by a sort of heaviness of spirits. I had acted a cheerful part at dinner, but there was little of my heart in the tongue I wagged. The recollection of the motionless figure seated upon the wreck, and darker yet, the memory of that bloated, long-haired phantom face sliding in the space of a breath across the gape in the shattered deck, with the sobbing wash of the black water on which it floated to put a dreadful meaning of its own into the livid, nimblo vision went for something—nay, went for a good deal, no doubt; but it was the hail that had come from the wreck which mainly occasioned my perplexity and agitation, and, I may add, my depression. Twice now had syllables sounding from where there were no lips to pronounce them reached my eats. Had I alone heard them I should have been alarmed for my reason, not doubting an hallucination, though never for an instant believing in the reality of the utterance; but the voices had been audible to others, they wore consequently real, and for that reason oppressive to reflect upon. The shadow of Wilfrid's craziness lay on his ship; the voyage was begun in darkness, and was an aimless excursion, as I thought, with no more reasonable motive for it than such as was to be found in the contending passions of a bleeding heart. Hence it was inevitable that any gloomy incident which occurred during such an adventure as this should gather in the eye of the imagination a very much darker tincture than the complexion it would carry under sunnier and more commonplace conditions of an ocean run. Whilst I lay over the rail lost in thought, I was accosted by Finn. "Beg pardon, Mr. Monson; couldn't make sure in this here gloom whether it was you or Sir Wilfrid. May I speak a Word with 'ee, sir ?" "Certainly, Finn." "Well now, sir, if that there old Jacob Crimp ain't gone and took on so joyful a frame of mind that I'm a land-crab if his sperrits ain't downright alarming in a man whose weins runs lime-juice !" "Old Crimp!" cried I, "what's the matter with him? " "Why, he comes up to me and says, 'Capt'n,' he says, 'there's Joe Cutbill, Jemmy Smithers, that funeral chap MuSin, and die 'tothers who was in the boat which wenjt to the wreck this afternoon, all aswearing that they heard a voice in the air!' and so saying, he burst out a laughing like a parrot. 'A woice!' says ho. ' So me and Mr. Monson aren't the only ones, d'ye see. Damme,' says he, 'if it don't do my heart good to think on't. There's the whole bloomin' boiling of us now,' says he, 'to laugh at capt'n; not Jacob Crimp only,' and here he buists into another laugh." "What does the old chap want to convey?" said I. "Why, sir, joyfulness as that he no longer stands alone as having heard a woice, for though to be sure you was with him that night, and some sound like to a cuss rose up off yon quarter, he feels like being alone in the hearing of it, for, yo see, a man in his position can't comfortably hitch on to a gent like you, and it was the harder for him, for that the man at the wheel swore that he never heard the cry." " He is superstitious, like most old lobscousers, no doubt," said I. "Have the others been talking about tins mysterious hail from the wreck?" "Ay, sir; 'tis a pity. It's raised an on easiness 'mongst the men. There's that Irish fool O'Connor, him that foundered the ' Dago, J going about with a faoe as long as a wet hammock and swearing that taint lucky." '' I don't know about its being wSuckyj' 1 said I, "but it certainly is most Confoundedly curious, Captain Finn." I saw him peering hard at me in the dusk. "But surely your honour's not going to tell me there was a woice P' said he. " As we were shoving ofljsaid I, "we. were hailed in God's name to return. Every man of us v in the boat heard it. There were but two bodies in the wreck, as stone dead as if they had died before the days of the flood. What say you to that, Captain Finn?" He pulled off his hat to scratch his head. After a pause, he exclaimed slowly, "Well,' I'm for leaving alone what isn't to be onderstood. There was ghosts maybe afore I was bom, but none since; and the dead h'ant talked, to my knowledge! since New Testament times. Old Jamtf&y; ttttti isn't to be had by dropping a bucket over the side, and if a truth lies too deep to be fished up by creeps, better drop it, says I, and fix the attention on something else." " You tell me the men are uneasy!" "Ay, sir." " "Do you mean all hands?" '' Well, your honour knows what salon are. When they're housed together nnder one deck they're like a box of them patent lucifer lights—if one catches, the whole mass is aflame."- •ilt's.a-passing fit of superstition," add I. " Give it time. Best say nothing about if to Sir Wilfrid." " Bless us, no, sir. Sony it's .raised so much satisfaction in that there old Jacob, though. A laugh in Jacob don't sound natural. Any Bort o* joyfolh&s; In such a constitution is agin iuituro." At this point Miss Jennings annfed on deck, and Finn, with a .shadowy fist mowing at his brow, stepped to the'opposite rail, where his figure was easily distinguished by the stars he blotted out. " I hope your spirits are better," said Miss Laura. • • "I should be glad to turn the silent sailor of that wreck out of my memory; but my spirits are very wefl." : "Wilfrid noticed your depression at. table, but he attributed It entirely to the dreadful sight you witnessed on the wreck." She passed her .hand through my arm with a soft impulse that started me into a walk, but there was so much real unconsciousness in her way of doing this—a childlike intimation of her wish to walk without proposing it, and so breaMng the flow of our speech at the momenfcrthat for some little while I was seared sensible I held her arm, and that I was pacing "with her. "But I think there is more the matter with you, Mr. Monson," she continued, with her face glimmering like pearl in the dusk, as she looked up at me, "than meets the ear—I will not say the eve." "The fact is, Miss Jennings," said I abruptly, "I am bothered." "By what?" "Well, what think you of the suspicion which grows in me that this yacht carries along with her, in the atmosphere that enfolds her, some sort of Ariel, whose mission it is-to bewilder out of its invisibility the sober senses of men of plain, practiced judgment, like your humble servant?" "You want to frighten me by pretend* ing that you are falling a little crazy." "No!" "Or you are creating an excuse to return home." "No again. How can I return home I" "Why, by the first convenient ship wo happen to sight and speak. Is this some stratagem to prepare Wilfrid's mind for your bidding us farewell when the chance happens?" She spoke with a subdued note and a tremble of fretfulness in it. "Suffer me to justify myself," said I, and with that I led her to the captain, who stood with folded arms leaning against the rail near the main rigging. ''Finn!" He dropped his hands and stood bolt upright. "Be so good as to tell Miss Jennings what the men are talking about forward." "You mean the woice, sir?" "What the men are talking about," said I. "Well, miss," said Finn, "as the boat that Sir. Monson had change of this afternoon was aleaving the wreck the men heard themselves hailed by a woice t'At begged 'em, in God's name, not to leavo the party as called behind. Mr. Monson, sir, you heard it likewise." "I did," I answered. "Another mystery," exclaimed Miss Laura, "quite as diurnal and astonishing as Muffin's phosphoric warning." "Thanks, Finn; that's all I wanted to ask you," said I, andweleft him to resume our walk. "Tell me about this voice," said the girl. I did so, putting plenty of colour into the picture, too, for I wanted her to sympathise with my superstitious mood, whilst. up to now there was nothing but incredulity and a kind of coquettish pique in her vokff and manner. "And you are afraid of thiB voice, Mr. Monson? I wonder at you!" "You should have my full consent to wonder," said I, "if it were the first time. but there was the other night, you know, with solid, sour, uncompromising old Crimp to bear me witness, and now again to-day, with a boatful of men for evidence." "Really, Mr. Monson, what do you want to make yourself believe ?" she asked, with a tone like a half laugh in her speech: "the dead cannot speak." "So 'tis said," I grumbled, sucking hard at my cigar to kindle it afresh. "Human syllables cannot be delivers-? save by human lips. What, then, could have spoken out of the darkness of the sea the other night?" "Does not Milton tell of airy tongues that syllable men's names ?" said I gloomily. . , , "Mr. Monson, I repeat that I wonder at you. How can you suffer your imagination to be cheated by some tnck of tho senses?" she laughed. "Pray, be careful. You may influence me. Then what morbid company shall we make! I am sure you would like me to believe in tins mysterious voice of yours. But, happily, we Colonials are too young, a people, to be superstitious We ^ ^ f o r our ruined castles, and our moated granges, , and our long, echoing, tagstry-hned corr.- 1 dors. Then, like you English, we ir-y tremble when we hear a mysterious voice. She started violently as she said this, giving my arm so smart a pull that * 1 instantly brought mo to a l^lt, whilst m " OH T" TJHELEK-KB MOTTTFT, "IHEEE'S SOMEONE ALIVE OK BOABD ! " a voice of genuine alarm she exclaimed "Good gracious! what is that?"
