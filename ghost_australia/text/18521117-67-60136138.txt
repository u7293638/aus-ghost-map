AMENDMENTS TO THE NEW CONSTI- TUTION. To the Editor of the Empire. Sm-In ono of your Into leading articles, on tito proposed Keir Constitution, you alluded to thc apathetic- indifference of tho colonists upon tho matter, in tovnis of reproach which I fear aro but too well descrvod. Notwithstanding, howovcr, tho great value of thc comments of tho colonial press in general, «nd of tho Empire's in particular, I for ouo have felt how necessary it is to get a bird's eye view of the whole subject, or to make some attempt to shadow forth tho principal improvements de- sirable in tho form of government proposed by tho committee. To my own mind I find that this object is best attained by framing n series of amendments in tho shape of a skeleton petition to the Legislativo Council. Upon looking over tho report of tho Commitec, 1 certainly hove felt in some degree astonished to And little more than a wholesale mid almost ser- vile imitation of tho Constitution for tho Ca- ñadas, with, in addition, the peculiar demerit of proposing 72 members in tho I louse of Assembly for thc colony of New South Wales, containing a population of only 200,000, whilst thu United t'utiadns aro satisfied willi S4 members for a po- pulation (according to tho Inst census) of nearly 2 millions of souls, lb appears manifest that tho members of tho committee, with their intellectual Australian prodigy nt their head, havo shirked all thu phi- losophical and constitutional points of tho wide subject heforo them, mid havo been content to as- sume tho character of humblo copyists. Lest, however, I trespass too far upon your spneo, I will unncludo by begging tho insertion of the petition referred to". JHCiNTIlAM'S GHOST.
