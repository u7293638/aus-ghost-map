THE BATTLE OP THE YARRA. A FRAGMENT. BY THE GHOST OF MACAULAY. BOB Fullarton, of Melbourne, by the beard of Berry swore, That Wright and Orr, the carpenters, should trouble him no more! By Berry's beard he swore it, and named a certain day When go they must, else the Harbour Trust would sweep the dock away. Swift on the wings of Rumour abroad the tidings flew ; But how the strife would end was more than the oldest gossips knew; For some declared there would be a row fit Virginia snakes to waken, " That to storm the dock they'd have to fight like Nelson at Copenhagen." Amphibious men came crowding fast along the Yarra banks, In boats they swarmed, in groups they formed to swell the dockmen's ranks; Shame on the lazy "lumpers " who linger round the "taps," When the cry is loud for a "bully crowd" to meet the Harbour chaps. * * * • * Meanwhile, the steamer "Warhawk," with the " Griper " following near, Went straight for dock, and right athwart the hawse of the " Souvenir "; » While language scarcely fitted for the ears police of a lady (Quite as bad as they use in Parliament} was hurled at Mister Brady. Some said the scene was disgraceful, some said 'twas a jolly lark, And some declared it was Berry's fault, urged on by A. T. Clark; But a loyal liberal mariner said, " Mates, ye're all in the dark 3 Why, 'Tis as plain as the end of a caps'en bar—it's a move of the Oligarchy!" There was plenty of noisy chaffing, and some words of bitterness spoken, But hardly a blow in anger struck—not a single skull was broken. And the heroes ranged in battle array, I humbly do opine, At one-and- six per hour might have held the gate till seventy-nine. May Heaven grant that, in Melbourne, Her Majesty's faithful lieges, May never be made familiar with more disastrous sieges; For there wasn't a single incident would a reader's feelings harrow, Occurred in the three days' fighting for the dock beside the Yarra.
