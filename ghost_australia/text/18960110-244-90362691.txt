Int.,,re them the sun was setting-sinking, sliding down a little nad a little into the fathernlost edge of the plain. So so ; andt rel and so c!se to the dead grass it seemed it muot set it afire. Behind them the blue, sn,aw-lined wall of the Sierras rlnch:d up to the c;odls. Tulare Lake glittered, andl gowed, and burned in tie red sun-lays untal its manyo ieague erystal bosum seemed struck by s:ome sudden transforming force of nature, and each single drop of water changed to diamond. The ebuny Centaur let its foot sliwly to the ground ; it took cff i:s sCouched bat, its four eyes looked straight into the west. A If-ard scampered away, n.st::tn tihe dry grasswith its scaly legs, a rquirdl vanished into its hole in the grouid. alnt a jack-rabbit paused in its gallop, tcared up on its haunches, with eyes standing inquit ingly up; its meek, surprised eyrrs tae'l as straight at the Centaur as those of th- Cctu taurotared itto the west.

The Halo of the sky slipped down to the earth and sprrad over te hobut ground and the trown deal clover. It'crept to tit lfet of the Centaur, and over its ol.acz g;lrsy hide, and stole into the face of tuo wouman.

Brassy had to talk. If he had not anyone else to talk to he talked to himself. They were a diversified three that sat down to the rough pine table which Brassy spread with a flourish against the wall. Moody. reserved Bill, child hearted ).einty, who had been reehristened thus by by Brassy because of his slightness of stature and fastidious ways, and theirrepres. sible, philosophical, goodnatured Brassy, who talked when he should have said noth ing, ant said nathing when he should have talked, and always hit in the wrong pace. An oddly assorted partnership that kept its bleating thousands on that territory of range whose boundary line was marked by its vast loncsomtness. Bat in a climate where the .squirrel, the orl, and the rattle snakedwelt peacefully in the sam- abode, even these three might har monise. The moon was full, and the men sat out side of the cabin, two of them taking their a(ter.supper smoke. The mysterious calm of the brecrcless tight had put upon them its sp.IlI of silence. Ni:l SIt with bowe I head, an.l whittled mechanically on a small piece of storvewood, ani Dainty held a cigarette careltsely be. tecen his. thumb an I forefin;er, and blew coantented little pulls of smuse away from his mouth. lirasy tuget'd and puffed at an o1,1 pipe, and watched Bill fr.m under the rim of b's hat.

" Listen, dun,t u ot hear acunioum sound !" said Dainty. All f them stopped and listened, but only kr a moment. " herciful God 1" shouteu Dressy, "rut lof your lives, it's the river over flowed I" They sprang forward and ran with much speed in spite of brush, and briars, and many stumblings. '" If we could only get to the slough lust,' p anted Brassy. The dry bed of the slough was only a few hundred feet beyond, but a wall of water higher than their heads was rolling down with terrible swiftrless upon them. The water from the river overtook them and lapped around their feet and up to their waists. It was uEeless now to try to rench the slough, impossible to cross it if they could, that crackling mulled roar was too near. They were between two floods; it was a moment to act without deciding. With one accord Bill and Brassy caughlt Dainty and hoisted him into tile forks of a large sapling, by the side of which they stopped, and scudded up after him. A minute later they were in the mid.t of a mile-wide waste of fast-rising water. lie. hind theru was the terrible, swift, rolling river, whose head was in the heart of the eternal snows; before them the slough, orer which they had walked dry-footed three bours before, rolled another river, swift. lowing, muddy, ice cold, and deadly deep. The sapling swayed and bent with their weight, sometimes dipping them into the chilling water, and shook and shivered to its topmost twig when some floating object lodged against it. Iligher rose the flood and swathed their soaked garments about them; it was so cold -so cold clinging; and the night so balmy and warm, and the moonlight so soft and so beautiful. " Partners," said Brassy, " I reckon we're euchered this time." " Looks like it," responded Bill, " and I'm quite willing." " Well, then, you're the fust man I ever saw that wa ready for rain. Course we'd bey to swing out smnne lay, an, drownin', they say, is , easy dath ; but to bedrownded like a panel o! treed squirrels disagrees with me. I might 'a' knowe'l these hot days,'t's cooked the grass dry enough to make yeast. powders, 'd melt tile snow an' bring down a flood. Yea, I've lived nigh the river long enough to be a-lookin' out for a thing like this. An' I deserve a soakin' fer bein' so oa thoughted, but I don't like to be drownded lile a miserable squir'l."
