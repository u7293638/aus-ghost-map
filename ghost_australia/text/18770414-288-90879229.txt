Yet they are notalways cor ^?Ictr— nay, they are,, very, very often entirely BpFTong; I have been nose-led into making Ian ass of myself by them many a time. We W may. meet a man of repulsive features or ' ungainly aspect on the street, and shudder Instinctivelv as we set him down as fit for a murderer at least : but' by-and-bye we are drifted' together and become acquainted. irhen, lo. ! his ill looks gradually disappear, and we discover in him one of the best and most genial of souls. And this is only one example — it is life all the world over. '~ Now. though in the present case the sym pathies of the reader may veer rounl, as mine did, from the injured to the injurer, let it not be thought for a moment that I mean the story as a palliation of crime. Murder means the gaUows ;? \and . if fate acted- 'niore Mildly in ; this case it seemed: only in perversity, when -life «eemed value :. less to the criminal. Iinerely wish to show | life* as *it exists^ Even-in a quiet, peace f ful; village, humanity can Jburot forth, crime & Stained iand terrible* startling all, far arid; near; .and .no true stiidy of the passions' which sometimes rend our breasts can be altogeijherunprofitable. ^ Shortly after 9, one fine morning in July, the^following message came in from the vil lage of C- ? , a picturesque little place about two miles from Edinburgh. ' A man named Donald Black has been shot in the glen this morning. Has been conveyed to his home, where Dr. ? at- tends. Is not expected to live. Suspicion 'points to ons man as the aggressor 5 but as the injured man has not yet spoken, per haps it would bs batter to send some one out to investigate before any arrests are made.' The slip being placed in my hand with out ^comment of any kind, I knew that my ordinary work, for that forenoon at least, 'was postponed. I took a cab out, as there 5s neither coacb nor rail, and was soon in-. I ' troduced at the home Urf the injured man, t 'which I might have ^ discovered: blindfold, if ; only by the excited: and gabbling crowd as sembled outside. ; . : Inside I f ound the medical man, a magis I $rate,'and the police superintendent for the 1 distinct.'

I went ,tp, the I; door and;- motioned- to imy-»mpa^ |I- ^upertateMent, r to enter, and then, without another word, walked straight to the fire place, over which a gun wa3 suspended across two nails. J took the weapon down, tried the lock, and snielt and inspected the; barrel. . 'This gun has been fired recently,' I said, -without looking, up or addressing any one in particular. But the suspected man answered at once, without a quiver — « It has.'; . I was a little s'.artled, and though a good deal hardened, even then, I believe for the moment I was more agitated than the niur .- derer himself. ' You'd batter be cautious what you say,' I warned. ; 'it will all be used against you.' ; ' ^\Tiat care I ?' was the fierce rejoinder. 'Tve been waiting for you, and Tm glad' you've come. The time went so weary and slew.1' . I exchanged looks, with my companion, who busied himself. getting out a pair of handcuffs. The young man noticed the shining steel without flinching, and then his eye travelled back to me. 'fdDid you fire the .gun P I slowly asked, '?When?' ?;.-.. ; 'This morning about. 6 o'clock, half-way down the glen.' ' ' Did you fife at anything ?' . 'Yes, I did !' The words came witha fierce, joyous burst, and a wild upthrowing of Tiis clenched hand in the air. 'I fired at Donald Black!' : 'Intentionally?' ' Yes, intentionally ; I waited for him.' There was a long breath and an ugly pause. ' Ah, that means murder, for I'm afraid you've killed him,' I got out at last. 'I meant to loll him,' he cried with gleaming eyes and an excitement terrible to behold, ' to have l»m lying dead at my feet, dead as the. hopes he has blasted, and the dear, ones he has given to the grave. I tell you, I fought against the thought — strug- gled with myself for months upon months — but it came to it at last. He brought it on himself. Ask him what he said about my mother last night at the Cross Keys Bin. I heard the words — I heard the jeers and laughter that greeted -the mon strous falsehoods— and that (not my own wrongs) forced me to it. The man is not fit to live. . I swore it last night on my mother's grave — my kind, loving mother, only two months gone — and I Gare not how soonldie.' ----- „-??— T^o words can convey the tone and ex pression with which this speech was given ; the ideas, appeared to choke each other and . rPll out. hot and seething, with a mad elo quence that bore all before them. When he stopped, he held out his wrists to the Superintendent to be handcuffed ; but the old man shoved the handcuffs out of sight, and turned away. He was strongly moved, and I was not surprised to see him wipe tears from his eyes as he got out in broken tones ? . . 'Oh, Jamie, I taught ye at the Sunday schule, an' its a' gane for naething! This is an awf u' end tae come tae.' ; For the first time something like a quiver crossed the young man's face ; but the next moment he was iron again. li. True, John,' he said, taking the old policeman's hand ; 'and twill never for get you while I. live, but, remember, other more awful deaths have brought it on.' Very little more was said ; and shortly after we locked up the cottage, and with out going back to the village, got quietly into the cab, and were driven into Edin burgh, taking the gun and our prisoner with us.' On the way he conversed -freely and ? unreservedly with me, sometimes on the r subject in hand, and sometimes' on his own pathy, and animation during the narration .hadrdrawn iim closer to me^ for he had not ?bean lc-ri|f locked up when he .expressed a . wisli to see ' the detective chap that came -in the cab with him.1' I spent the best part of the afternoon in his cell, and in that 'time got from him bis simple story, 'which ? I.wilT now try to repeat to my readers : — Jamie £jr&igV; Katie Bell, and f. Donald -Black fwere schoolmates together. - Thet 'three had^all -bB'en^brn^'^-^^i^and-.-'-by-' ?»some invisible agency had; been drawn :i5--t * geth'ei* a's ; inseparable playmates. ? It : was ; icertainly a strange thing for -a' girl; . to, cpn-0 2sort with two boys— to scramble about the |glen hunting. for 'sooroeks/' flpWers,iand wild :6)^wbeme;s;-''an.d~^en^P:^t^jaw^vbj Hhe edgei-of the stream, building firm ^castles eof the great elones, and. still ^firmer looking - ?castles in the air — but. it is none 'the: less Vtrue. The^ strange trio -?rere hardly ever '^separate — morning, noon, and evening were ^they to be^ 'seen together, chattering, scram bling, racing, playing, and. -pfenning, but' .never fairly qjiiarrelling. .^ / \ These, of course, were sunny days to look . tback on— and stood out- vivid and clear in at least pneihoughtf ul innid— that of Jan^ie 'Craig. In all their wise councils and dis cussions if -wasialways a settled :tnang that he wS^ggrow iup and xnarryfEatie^ Belly ' ;and that; Donald Black was to come and see theni: in their grand^ house Tip on the face-»f the liill; 'Only once was there anything like a rupture rbetwee3jthem,'and that, with its ?leBufe,^%as:--^-\singular^':i3iat..I feel con strainedito. notice it here. !Donald, who was full of '4&e; '?«nd T)ojlsli ;n^eMeI/ threw a j .handful bf;ibpse^a,rtib.|in ^ ^Katie's ^face in a jmpment of thougiitlefistiess, Tie^rjy : blinding :-3ber, and^-causing -la\g£ to scream with fear '?. fnd pain. -Jaifiie^Tyas'ori the vipot in*& mpr\ anpn^^and vmstently knocked Donald over the edge ot Ih^/patii among ^ lie', busiies— not aboVet; twenty.1 yards ifromf: the spot where, fifi&en; years after, a tar more terri ble ' 'encpuafer was; 'to; 'iKke'^pee;' The stricken boy rolled dossal the ^ope till he was near ^the water,- and then Jay awfially; jstill among .the stones. ; Jamie and Katie above- both screamed at = the siafet: and -flew ? to pick '? up,- as they tJioii|glit, the lifeles^;: body, when the . tricky little : rascal raised iis head from among the siones; and grinned in,their faces, as sound and unhurt^asthem ?feelves; .? -- .' :; ' -? ????-'? ' - - '?- ;-;': v-: ?'- '???'? . But here comes the singu%r thing. Shortly afier? Jamie and Eatie i came upon, him; cut- ting and carding away 'at; some bold, straight; lines on the ^hmSof atree- with nsome crude representations of Jotuman figures beneath. They sat down to -watch curi ously till' he had done! when J they asked the meaning of the thjng, .which the young artist, nothing loth, immediately proceeded to explain. . m 'This,' said he, pointing' to the'straight lines—' this is a thing tiiey call a gallows ?r^-tliere1s a picture of one in a book in our house—and it's what they hang' ;pepple on for killing a boy like me. This, down iiere is me, lying dead on the grouad. I've been killed, you know, by being thrown down a hill. Tl.ein men at the other side are all the people that have come to see the. boy hanged. This thing here, this round thing, with its head all hanging to one side, aud the rope at it going up to the gallows, is the boy that has killed me, and his name's Jamie Craig,' and the last words came out with a spiteful unction as he looked his little companion full in the face. Jamie said nothing, but only stared in a kind of horror and fascination at theru:de cutting. Not so with Katie. Her cheeks r burned up at once ; she sprang up, and be fore Donald could utter another word she had brought her Jittle hand down with a stinging slap on his face. ^^Idare say Donald -would have retaliated^ though she was a girl, land younger than bimself, but it so happened that the moment ; the. blow had descended Katie burst outf . a-crying, turned away, put her arms roand Jamie's nccV. and drew him sorrowfully away from the s:;ot. Donald stood gazing after them in mo tionless surprise till they, had disappeared, and then he amused himself in slashing at the soft bark till every trace. of his work had vanished, when he took his solitary way home, feeling savage enough to have used the knife on something much softer than trees. Next day the whole was f brgiven; and they were as good friends as ever. This was only childhood, but youth did not bring any material change. In the na tural course of events Donald Black drifted away southward, and was lost sight of ; while Katie Bell went into service, and for long was seldom seen about her native vil lage. Jamie Craig grew up a sturdy, self reliant man, with only his mother to care for, when not hewing at the stones that gave him a livelihood, or digging in the books that gave him so much pleasure. Peo ple said he was quiet and slow, but there were strange depths of passion and power surging beneath that the people knew no thing about. But all at once there came a change— bright, startling, and wondrous. Katie Bell returned to the village : and one evening, in sauntering down the glen, with the declining sun slanting redly through, the trees across his path, the young-mason came full upon her. She bloeked the narrow path ; and when Jamie, with the old fami liarity, took her smiling face between his two hands, and turned it to the sunlight, he discovered two things — that she was now actually a woman, and the most beautiful he had ever looked upon. Perhaps the people were right in calling him ' slow,' for, thongh the meeting was repeated and repeated, and stole out into long, delightful walks, which seemed like a dreamy vista of fairyland to look back on, it was long ere the true state of affairs dawned upon Jamie's mind. Then he found that love — deep, glowing, and real — had taken the place of all his former vague ima ginings. He dreamt of Katie by night and pictured her by day, and there was.no plan lor the future in his mind over which she did not in some magic way preside. His Looks were thrown aside, and he was now to take his first lesson from real, tangible humanity. I have said that the new passion, in its first overwhelming rush, filled his whole soul and being ; I am not so sure that it was equally powerful on Katie's side. He firmly believed that it was; but then lovers are not always the soundest judges of these n-atters, and the sequel will speak for it-, self. It was at last tacitly understood, how ever, that after a fitting interval of months they were to be man and wife ; and thus matters stood -when a new change came about. Striding through the village one night to . meet Ms sweetheart, Jamie was suddenly pulled back by a strong hand on Jiis shoul der, and turning roundj he found himself facing a very handsome and rather stylishly dressed young man;- who smiled into liis face in a most knowing and provoking manner. ' I beg; your pardon, but I don't know you,' he began; tnitthe other only laug lied boisterously, and gave his own thigh a de lighted slap. ? ? : '?? - - - ' Not know me !' he cried. ' Well, that ; beats all ! Why, I'm Donald Black, whom ;you used to play with' and throw down ? among tite-bushe's when yoV%ere about W= high!' and he indicated ^ the height -.of a, seven-year-old. They shook hands heartily ;fbut, in spi^e of every effort, Jamie could\ not appear quite cordial to his old^piaymateV' The so journ in England^ in his eyes, had not im proved the man before Mm. It4iadonly made bad into worse,and left him a~bril liant, flashy rake^.^so, whlen Donald pro posed an adjournment to a public-nous^ 4o talk of old times, the p^iercdrew;; back at once. 'You will excuse me to-night,' he said. ' I have to go alorigliere to meet — to maet some one.' ' ' * ': ' ?-??-.? It was strange he could- not bring Mm self to pronounce the name of Katie -Bell, nor even to allude to her in any way, f ami liarthouglf they had all' onee been. Bat, his hesitancy and constraint were quite lost on the other. ' f' Oh, -well, I can go that way with you, and talk by the way,' he r unsuspiciously - returned ;- and, as there was no loophole of escape, the young mason was forced to comply. But when they met Katie walking de murely among the trees, and the first burst of recognition and greeting was over, Jamie was no longer troubled with his new com panion's attentions, f or^they were au trans f erred to the pretty'girrwhb bad engaged j'ipus complication. Neither of the loveri ' had. the courage to confess the real state of^ /affiairs — the new arrival exerted himself to - the utmost to fascinate the young girl— and gradualiy-the xather-baekward and retiring Jamie found himself completely shut out of their conversation. A sickening pang, such as pie had never felt or dreamt of before, xan through his heart as he watched the two in silence in a ceaseless and animated chatter ; till, at last, his feelings found vent in ja, burst that made the pretty, girl, open her eyes in astonishment, and, worse than all) drew from her a hot reply, that only hastened the ^rupture, and gave Donald Black 'bis ?wish,'by sending the young mason off I altogether, and leaving Mm to conduct Kajtie hoiriealone. Jamie went home in a state of terrible excitement that nearly frightened Ms mo ther out of her senses, tp brood over the handsome exterior of Ms new rival and every bright look that had passed between him and Katie. Katie went home smiling and laughing, but, I have no doubt, to have a good cry in solitude ; while Donald Black went home with-but one purpose ^rooted in his mind— to 'cut out' the 'slow clod hopper,' and possess the girl Mmself in his own way. There was no re^t for the young mason that night, at least— and he knew it^-and as soon as his mother was asleep he slipped back to the kitchen, took down his gun, shot-bag, and powderflask, and went out and had a night's poaching among the hills and plantations adjoining — a tiling he had not done for years. It was there, among: the trees, after bringing down a hare that had run out before him, that it first occurred to him how easy it would be to bring down a man in the same way. The mere level- . ling; of a tube — a touch at -the trigger —a : puff . and a flash — and the thing was done, . But the idea startled and horrified ,'liim,'.' though his .blood was at boiling heat.; and the moon looked down at him through the dark trees like a white ghost, and he flei ^thespot, leaving his spoils on the ground. He got out of the wood, feeling like a mur derer pursued, and fancying that every tree showed the rude carving of a gallows and crowd thaf he had looked upon years and years ago. Looking at the case impartially, I think Katie was no light coquette who could change the bent of her affections in an hour — she had . simply mistaken warm friendliness towards Jamie for love, and, seeing his strong affection for her, nad agreed in a passive way to become his wife. It was to be different now, for before either she or Jamie could unbend. so far as to \ make up the quarrel, Donald ^Black had J stepped between, with his handsome face, and a stream of banter, flattery, and nonsense that might have carried a far more surely grounded girl off her feet. The long delayed flame now caught her heart ; but it blinded her to everything gopd^ and noble, and when the young mason came to her, broken and penitent, she told him that for Donald Black she was now ready to. live or die, and sent Mm off with a f eelinj like death at his heart. But was he convinced? did he believe her words? Not a bit of it. Eveiy one else could see the whole thing as plain as day ; but he was a lover, and still clung to the one idea — she was only trying him. He went back to his books, but they had lost their charm. He took to brooding moodily by the fire, and spent his winter nights in fierce hunts over hills and through woods, where the sound of his gun brought out many a watcher and gamekeeper who never guessed how lucky they were in not laying hands on the desperate and excited criminal they were chasing. ... At last, when the spring was gone, a vil lage gossip one day brought to the cottage door a piece of news affecting Katie's fair name that froze Mm to a statue as he sat inside by the fire. His mother, who knew all, came in presently, and read his ghastly face lite a book. The tears rushed, into her eyes, and she put her weak arms on hi&* broad shoulders and drew him close. 'Oh, Jamie, how you suffer I' she cri3d. ' If I could only bear it for you !' ' Never mind, mother,' was the sfcaady reply. ' I will suffer no longer ; I will know the worst before I sleep,' and he looked up at the clock, and fumed and fretted that it wanted three hours of' sun down. . ? ? - - ? ' You don't believe, it then ?' timidly ventured the mother. ' Don't shrink axul shudder, for it cuts my heart as wsll'as yours.' 'I don't know— I will soon,' was the moody reply. - - ' ? '? V ' How did you quarrel ?' Oh, Jamie it was an evil hour; for you have never liad a happy day since.' ' It was. I, was jealous of Donald Blackj and said to her, * Swear never to speak to that man or smile on him, or you shall never be wife of mine.' ' ?_' '_' 'And she sSid'f ? - _,'.'.:. 1C . ' '-... 1 'That she — had learned to ..like him better than me,' was .the groaning answer. ' She spoke the truth.' ' j will see to-night.' _-s Perhaps it/was chance, but as lie spoke his eye travelled toTflie gun over the fire place. His mother read, the -glanee, and screamed out in a way that brought him bounding to his 'iee-t.'- fl Oh, Jamie?* cried the shaking mother, 'swear to me that you will not- lift your hand — that you wilT injure no one?' , ' Tut, tut ! is that^all f ' \ - ^- : V : y. 'Swear it, if you love me]' andthe mother got desperate iniier wild clinging-. i ? I swear it. There, don't bother your _head about it, jtipr about me, either ;' and .with these words he got .put of 5 the house and wandered about till near sunset, when lie took Ms .way to the glen. There he Md Mmself among the bushes close to the path, where' ne could.' see 'and hear every -pair of lovers that passed, and then settled himself to watch and 3jai£-. Tfiepair he waited-^ for were- tardyf--iand; it^-was soon ? nearly dark ;i but whenl they did come, one gentle voice ^was there that struck a tHrill to Ms heart that; fofc a' moment sent Ms brain reeling and made him grasp convul sively at the ljushes . for support.- . He: watched them with gleaming eyes, far down the slope, till they were seated, and then with Indian-like^ stealth he crept and crawled through the underwood till he was within a few yards of the spot.- :There was~ no love, fulsome flattery, or merry laughter now between the pair he listened to — but in their place bitter reproaches, jegrs, and piteous entreaties that made his very heart stand still 5 and Katie's; face, though beau tiful still, now looked like the ghostly face of theinoonhV had.' seen looking down on Mm on the night of their first quarrel. . --.,*vBut y6u promised to marry me, ^Donald/' nsobbed the poor girl, ' and the people ai;e beginning to talk.

But I wish you would go: away out of here-1— everyone whispers and stares at me,' and the villain gnawed sul lenly at his nails, and looked as if he was 5 ;the injured, not the injurer. ' ' I will go away — to my grave,' was the wailing reply. 'Oh, monster! fiend*! _TJ could kill you if I had not loved you. But I deserve it all, and more misery than heaven can ever heap upon me, for throw ing away the noblest heart that ever throbbed/' and she rose and scrambled with wild energy up to the path. ' Dp not follow me, Donald Black, or I may forget myself ; do not look at me — think of me — again ; and if we meet, I pray God it maybe at the Judgment Seat !' She was gone like a spirit, and a blinding red cloud rushed bs fore the eyes of the concealed listener. A careless wMstling awoke Mm, and he saw the man who had. done it all sitting where he had been left, grinning: complacently to Mmself. - . : . ; ? ' Well, I've managed it at last !'; chuckled the villian, aloud. ' Fairly shaken her off. Who'd ever have thought she'd take so much kicking and scoffing and taunting ? I wish she was dead— dead .and buried, and forgotten— and. then I would be free to look everybody in the face, and I -could marry, and be comfortable and happy.' . : : , , , He rose as he spoke, and went wMstling' away ;~ and a pair' of' 'blpod-shbt ' eyes~ watched him every step, and a wild prayer went up through the darkness to all the powers of heU/or evil for a gun — a- gun^-a gun?' , '; / ? ; ;?.''.' / '.',?,'.''., ^ But the prayer was breath wasted on the: night, and then after clenching Ms head between his strong hands for a moment pr two,, the maddened watcher got out from under the dark leaves and tore away from the spot, through the bramble and brake, hill and corse— he never knew where. It : was a strange, hurrying vision, in wMch he saw-notMng distinctly, except *? Thou shaltr not kill,' in letters of fire, just as he had seen, it every Sunday in. the village church. - ? * ; ?: i ~ It was near morning, when he found himself in Ms own home, with his mother bending over him. in anguish and. trembling. He knew that face, and those gentle; hands, in spite of the whirl of everything else ; for something like tears came into Ms eye3, and he wailed out— .'..?? ' Oh, mother, hold my head, for I think there is something come over. me '.'and then he forgot everything in a terrible dream of struggling and fighting. . .'-''... : Next day it was all over the village ithat Katie was gone , away — ^no one knew whither^ but the news did not reach or disturb Jamie ; for he was shouting and fightirg with Ms poor, weak mother in a mad paroxysm of brain fever. Days passed away, and terrible cries and sounds; were heard issuing from the lonely cottage [; but, . for fear the villagers would pronounee-it madness/ the pPpr. mother watched, and, tended him alone. In one of , these': fearful struggles, Jamie had struck his., mother a violent blow in tWbreast, which: he knew nothing of till he was 'gradually recovering, and. she was— drooping. -'-..-,'-BW: r ; The weeks passed away, but in the quiet peaeef ulness of his convalescence the youn r mason iioticed for the first time the change on his mother as she crawled weaHy.abou to attend Ms wants.
