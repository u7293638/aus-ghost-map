The Emperor conducted the bride and bridegroom to the middle of the church, assuming his station, with the Empress immediately behind. Around the bridegroom stood Prince Arthur and the Grand Dukes. The wedding rings, borne on golden salvers, were deposited on the altar temporarily, until placed on the fingers of the bride and bridegroom. The magnificent chapel was illuminated with innumerable wax candles ; the floor was covered with velvet, crimson and gold carpet; the pillars and altar were covered with gold. The Greek marriage ceremony was unique in the absence of """c. Chests and interred prayers' were given during the service. The crowns were held suspended over the heads of the bridal pair Prince Arthur holding the crown over the Duke of Edinburgh, and Prince Sergius that over the bride. The Imperial Confessor then said-When servant of God; Alfred Ernest Edward, art crowned for this handmaiden of God, Maria Alexandra, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." Prince Arthur, becoming tired of holding the heavy crown, was relieved. Then the Epistle to the Ephesians 5th chapter, 20th and 23rd verses, was read. After the reading was concluded the marriage at Cana of Galilee was read. The crowns were removed, and the married couple walked thrice around the raised dais, holding to the tip of the confessor's robe with one hand and a candle in the other. At the conclusion of this ceremony the sacra- mental cup was brought forward, blessed and partaken of by the bridal pair, the con- fessor presenting the cross, which both kissed.

The procession then slowly formed, proceeding to the Hall of Alexander for the Anglican service. Dean Stanley, of Westminster Abbey, officiated. The walls were decorated with battle pictures. Dean Stanley, who during the solemnisation of the Greek church service, wore a Protestant Episcopal Doctor of Divmitjhatand gown, and who now appeared on the altar wearing an Episcopal surplice with a jewelled collar of the Order of the Bath around his neck, was assisted by two resident English clergymen. Both the American and the English colony were gathered on the left of the altar. Conspicuous among them was Governor Jewett, the American Minister, Lord Loftus, the English Minister, and Diplomatic officials. Many English officers, in full costume, were also present. Especially notable was the venerable Prince Gortschakoff, surrounded by the leading members of the Russian nobility. The Episcopal chants were given by Russian chorister lads in long crimson dresses. When the marriage procession entered, the bride walked between her father and the bridegroom. Prince Arthur walked behind. The beautiful Anglican wedding service was then impressively performed by Dean Stanley, the Prince and Princess responding according to the form enjoined in the Book of Com- mon Prayer. The delivery of the final benediction, " God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost bless, preserve, and keep you," was especially touching. The services being concluded, Dean Stanley congratulated the newly-married couple. Several Roman Catholic dignitaries were present. The bride looked earnest, sweet, fair-faced ; the bridegroom grave, self-possessed. The Princess of Wales was lovely, pale and delicate. The German Crown Princess looked healthy-the image of her mother, Queen Victoria. The Prince of Wales was apparently on excellent terms with the German Prince, and both looked well. During the Ceremony in the English chapel, the Empress of Russia, being a confirmed invalid and fatigued, seemed overcome, and made a motion of holding a handkerchief to her eyes when the married couple saluted her. The ceremony being concluded, the crowd dispersed. There was only a limited display of popular enthusiasm. An illumina- tion of the public squares took place, and the general scene was one of splendid festivity. The service formed an extraordinary combination of ceremony, wealth, pomp, and splendour. After the marriage rites there was a banquet at the palace, and subsequently a ball at the gorgeous hall. At the close of the ball the bridal couple were formally marched to the bridal chamber, accompanied by the Emperor and officers of the Court. The festivities were continued after the retirement of the happy couple, the Emperor being present.
