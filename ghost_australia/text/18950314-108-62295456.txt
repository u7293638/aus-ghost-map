I'ORTFOLIO. The education in riglteousness is the growth of the soul into over closer union with Je?sus Christ. It is the one thing valuableo i intetior life, this advance in righteousness-That is, this closer con tract with "the Lord our Riglhteousness." All the teachitngs, all the agencies of the Church are coscentieted on effecting this in the soul. And perfect righteou.ness-the holi ness withont which "no man shall see the Lorl"--is the final crown of a colm pleted character. Even here the iaints have a foretaste of that blessedness which is the consequence of perfection of the soul in Ihin, and whilth is the certain reward of those who, by grace, prseverve. As the wanderer toils up the rough paths of the Great St. lernard, lie sees on either side the signs of desola tion, and abore him the crests of eternal snow. Front point to point fair glimpses of distant valleys open for a moment, and then are screened by the envious clifs; the storm wraps the rocks in darkness in the autunti night, and blinds the traveller with the driving snow; even in the suimmer evening only sparse shreds of golden sunlight wanddr tear fully as if trespassers, in thle craanies of the clefts; but a church bell here and there rings out the Angelus, and reminds him of a better hope, and of another world. He climbs the crest, and soon below him lies another landscape under a fairer heaven. Instead of toil, and struggling labour, rough rock and roar ing torrent, lo ! the calm, soft sunshine, bright skies and fair valleys of Italy. Christ's pilgrim wanders on; lie has stray lights, and sounds of music from another world; but a seol does grow with persevering faithfulness to grace; there "is righteousness and pence and joy in the Hoily Ghost"-foretaste of the land of 'pence, beyond the gateways of the day,-Canon Knox-Little.
