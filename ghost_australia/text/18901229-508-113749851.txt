On tbiti i pocaaioxt it was a yery respectable old wo6iaa- one of the oldest of the inhabitants Of the ts-wn- Who^ had died. When in life f this old lady was, to say the least, one of the, plaineBt loqldng—^bnly it would; ;be - ' wronig to use the word, t.. would say . one of _? the. ujjiiest-r— women I ever saw- She 'must ; have been a powerful woman; She was then, at time of death, over- 90 years of ag^, and last time I saw her alive she was a coarse strong vroman. '. . .?'.' 6 . - This woman had three daughters, who in size took After their mother. Two of them . were fairly . good-looking, . .but Were inclined to be coarse. The third was the picture of her motherland was not good looking, The sons were well built men, about -6ft-?in. Both had served in the army. I never knew the father, but 1 think the sone must have taken after their father, j*b^ they were fairly good looking men, but their sisters Were much taller and grosser. . .'..,'' One of the daughters ' Twas married and lived in Dublin. ? .'When, her raotiier died she came down to. her ^Euneral, or rather I should' have said,, she came to see her mother previous to her death, and reffiain'ed until she died and was buried. She brought with her a really handsome lady^ like girl, her only daughter, then about 18. The news got abroad of the ^d. =w'bmaii!JB' death, so, of course, I should go aipng with some other young people for a short time , to the 'wake. 5 hut, to speak honestly, for me the great attraction was to isejB this nice young lady* the granddaughter. 1 went down aboat 8 o'ciock^^and was receivedivery k^diyiby^the second eldest daughter, then a Woman of over^Q ijreara*. (She is ^alive yet,: and mufit be byer ^0.} She asked me ,'_«.* If X 'wished., to see her mother?' I said, **'t3ertainly.' - ; For, although I was only a moment in 'the parlor, I had taken a rapid glance* round the room to see tt I could recognise' this fair young damsel whom I had seen in town, and niece -of the lady ? had been speak ing to. There were many nice young girls there that I knew, and at any other time would have been glad to. have had an opportunity -to have' a tihat or bit of fun with, them, but ?! wished now to s.ee the fresh arrivaL ? '?.'?,..- I was brought up-staire to a good^Bized room in Trhich there 'were about a dozen people, some of whom I kne#, and I also saw the young lady from BabTiiU She was, no doubt, a nice lady-looking girl. -I had first to jgp and see the depafrfcedl I never was more surprised in my life iflian when I looked upon that iraee. Death had done wonders there. Heally, the features that were almost repulsive to youhad now become n&ble-lbbking;^ without any: of the horrible ftirrO\fs, /and all the other lines which frequently dipfigaie -the face; ; WMle__I -.&$bp.d Jooking at tn^^^^o^iaai.,, a friend was brought to the ?bedside ^by the, married daughter. .^Mskiysioias^o. looked ~ a£ the 1 corpse with ;the* same astonishment that £. ? did j ljut- there was this dijtference, I said nothing of what 1 thought, but she exclaimed : ' Oh, then, it's' herself that looks lovely, the pttpayoldj dear creature. If she could only see her self new she'd ise the proud woman. Sure, she never looked half so handBoine in her life.' _' I never was so hard-pressed in my life to keep from laughing when she said .**. she never looked half bo handebme in her life.'* Weilf now, she might have 'sworn, that part of the matter with the greatest safety. I was afraid to make any Remark whatever, feeling I would spoil the pleas ing effect the remarks made by their female friend had eyidently left upon, both daughtefBi ^o- while., the thtee ladies were dis^uisi^ all the gotjd ijtiaU^es of the dead woman which lay before them* I made my W&y; over tb the granddaughter of the deceased. . . . , I kheyr iiie young lady Who Was sitting next, and wont qy£r and shook hands with heu? and sh«, knowing I was rather a lively young lad, 'Was glad %o get ine near her,,., as [.they were all as solemn as they possibly could „ be for ^ybulag people. - I was introduced to the young l#dy froni^ ^Dublin, and xay old friend so arranged if that she got me seated between them. ^ t was not long there until I had them almost in fits *triving to suppress their laughter. I told both what the lady said about the corpse, and Jihe granddaughter enjoyed it greatly, - Her aunt jcame along with her mother, and the aunt eaid to iae- rt I will have to remove you if you do not keep quiet' Tlie mother pf the young lady eaid ** st*st them alone, Sarah : they are all youngs and. axe doing no harm.'

Whe^L they went 'to lift her She heaved a deep sigh. All of them irere greatly frightened, but the sister, Vho Was a brave, sensible woman, motioned to them to reinam still, had thelady TaiseU a little in the bed, and gave her a teaspoonful pf brandy and water. She rapidly began to show signs of life. The sister told the nurse and the lady of the house to place the coffin on the floor by the side of the bed, and asked the lady of the house if she Would kindly send for one of the doctors. This was done, but by 'the time he arrived the lady had so far recovered that she was able to speak. ; ** As soon as the doctor came he saw what had been done, and then recommended further nourishment. Both medical men Saw her through the dav. The lady gradu ally gained strength, and in about a month, instead of going home as it was intended $he was to have gone in. her coffin, she re turned to her family in restored health.' The relating of this story caused much Surprise. It is perfectly true— -^a well authenticated fact. X then told them a story of a young fellow, a great chum of my own named 'Smith, whom mang* in that room knew. When about 10 yeaxs of a^e, a fine strong boy, he got a sudden attack, and the doctor said it was brain fever. He daily got worse. One morning my. mother, sent me to see how Gteorge was. One of- Ms sisters . opened the door. She had been crying, and she said : ' Tell your mother George died about one hour since.' I went -home and cried when telling of my playmate's death. When Mrs. Smith and the nurse had breakfast they went upstairs to see about laying George ; out in death. A. bath -had .been previously pre pared that poor George should have had, but he died before it was ready. Some of the water, was removed from the bath, and the remains of George Smith were lifted into the bath by the nurse and his mother, with the intention of washing him. George had been cupped in the back of his neck previous to his death, but.no. blood came. While he was lying in the bath, although the water was only tepid ;ji£ caused the blood to flow from the wounds in his neck. George moved in the ba$4j and the nurse cleared Out of the rooms His mother, with a true mother's love^aafd beingen educated woman^saw at ohcejfchaKr the child whom they all thought dead #aB coming back to life.She gently ru8fr©t£ his chest with her warm hand, and about the region, of the heart.

This startled Borne of them terribly. v - George was asked if it was true* and he_ said it Was perfectly correct. He also let them look at his neck, which bore evident traces Of the severe treatment he under went when cupping him. : He was their a fine fellow about 20 years of age. ..._... ? .George Smith then told a siory about the old nurse, who, he said* ' Was a ^podr hearted, good-natured woman, but she was a great believer in ghosts and fairies. His! mother was kind to her, and when she died Mrs* Smith sent George with some provisions for the wake and some money for the funeral.*' Smith said, ' she had been liedridden for some time, and had ? got cramped, sitting up, and she . died in that cramped position. When she was laid but they could not get her legs to keep down, Bo- they put's heavy fiajg or stone across her-knees. Everything was in good order.j thejfe We¥e plenty of 'pipes and;tfo feaecO, and Whisky and cakes, and stories were freely indulged in — many of them ghost stories* and some of them iiad been not only told by the departed, but firmly believed in. « One of the young fellows -gwld tell a story well, and he was ifea. the sroom with the corpse^ and the ,y©amg JJgople came crowding tb such an extent ~tliat all %h& available seats were occupied, and two or three sat on the side -of —the -hed with th&- corpse.

White Was an exceedingly hardy little man, about lw££ 4in in height^ yery clean in. hisperson, and quiclt ! ait&aB; moveiaents. Until a few years previous ;to ^: MfiTdeath; he lived in a nice cottege' which wfiir kept t«ry neat. ?''He was fond of rearing shrubs and aU- sorts of flowers. On ea^hj quarter, day. when his pension came due, he generally got a -few days* leave froni hia^employer in order to have a spree Vithvflotne ^old^ pensiohers. ? He waa an excegdiogly intelligent man, but reserved, unless amongst those whom he Wished to look upon as friends. .1 was permitted to visit his. cottage as such, and many times presented the old man with game, on my way home after a day's shoot-, ins:. It was : a treat to hear the old man when he was . in gqod form, relating the storming of x. ' Badajoz,' or the battle of «« Salamanca,' his many stories of the Peninsular wars, or the final battles of Waterloo. He was indeed a brave old soldier, and 'when he lost his situation by going away without leave, and remaining away for nearly a month on a drunken spree, most persons who knew him were sorry to see the ? change which had come over him. He left his neat cottage and 'settled down with a low class of people in a cheap cabin in a back part of the town. Some of his old friends used to go and see him, and bring him a present now and again. Just hef ore he drew his last quar ter's pension he seemed very gloomy. There were two of Ms old friends who had called to see him. I was one of the number. The other friend. brought Mm a nice piece of bacon, and I had 'just given him a pair of rabbits, and had, in the early paTt of the day* sent him some turf. My good mother asked me 'What I did with the rabbits?' I told heri and said, 'I was sorry- to see 'poor old N. White so low spirited, and I'w^as afraid they found it difficult to live on Ms. pension.' \- My mother said, 'It;anustbe; you had better iill a sack with potatoes, and I will give you some oatmeal, butter ?- and bacon, and you can bring it yourself after you take your tea.' I was glad of this, and when I had finished my tea I got. the largest sack I could find, filled it, and got my father to help me to_ put it on the cart. He asked me ' where I was going with the potatoes ?' I told him where my mother was sending me. He replied, ' Poor old fellow, I am s©rry to hear that.'. Then, after a pause, he said, ' This is so like . your mother j she is never tired trying to do good — aye, even by stealth.' \ . Just at the moment my mother came looking for me. Father turned round and .«-i±jtt.t;u. J-Ltii. . wiia.li waa tiixxa bub wtto uuiug ; She told him ' not #- notice,; that it was some little thing she was sending me with.' He said ** I know all about it, you ; will ruin me j'? and in a playful manner he put his hands both: sides of her ^cheeke and, kisMhg her, said *' I will leave yourself and your. son to carry out your*scheme.' . . r;i; . . I went with mother and'*bgbught the things she had ready- 5 and, when I placed them ,ift.~, the cart, T J drove .off on any_ missiop?

I was simply disgusted at the conduct thatwas carried on. Towards the end of the second night a lot of low rowdies got into the house. They had received refreshments about 12 o'clock, and at about 5 o'clock in the morning they demanded more from the window. TMs was refused. They became impudent, and the affair ended by the friends of the old man pitching them into the street. All his old friende aad a number of the townspeople followed his remains to the, grave. This,, as before stated, was the last wake of such ^a. character that I went to. They Jiave, to a very greatic extent, ceased* Certainly, with all respectable people in Ireland, publie wakes are un» known. Many times wakes were made an excuse for young pex-ple being out iat night, and frequently ihe results hi tfaeSfc meetings were anything' but goodv- '
