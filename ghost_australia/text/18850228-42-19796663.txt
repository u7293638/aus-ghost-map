The Lost of the Crusaders. IT was in the Soudan I first saw, to my amazement, the mail armour of the Middle Ages actually in use. Whether original or a copy, it was undoubtedly the dress of the Crusa- ders. The hauberk of mail was fastened round the body by the baltan, and formed a complete covering from head to foot. The long two handed double-edged sword was worn between the leg and the saddle. This appears to me an additional proof that this chain armour actually came from the Saracens, who stripped it from the bodies of slain or captured knights. The wearer of this medieval garb was Sheikh Mohammed Sebekh, of the Halawin tribe of Bagarra Arabs. I asked him where he bad got his armour. He replied that it had boen in his family 310 years. I may add tho horse's head was encased in steel, and its body covered with a quilt thick enough to turn a spear. It was shaped liko the armour one reads of in Frois sart. The man rode fully seventeen stone, being ovnr six feet high. The first time I met him was on the occasion of our first night alarm. It was moonlight, though cloudy. Hearing a bugle sound, I rushed out of my tent, and was as much astounded as though I had seen the ghost of my great-grandfather. In front of me was the apparition of a knight clad in full armour, lance in hand and sword on thish. I rubbed ray eyes and thought I was dreaming. But the spectre vanished not; and in truth proved to be an actual flesh and blood knight of tho Soudan, temp, nineteenth century. How is it we find these "knights" clad in Crusaders' armour here, far in the interior of Africa ? The garb of ancient chivalry lingered in Spain after it had been discarded by the rest of Europe. It vanished with the publi cation of Cervantes' famous satirical romance, and seems to have crossed the Straits of Gibraltar; but who would ever have thought of going to the White Nile to find a modern representative of the knights of old?-"With Hicks Pasha in the Soudan," by Colonel the Hon.
