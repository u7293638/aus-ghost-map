A Bendigo Ghost Hunter- A BENDIGO correspondent complains of a prize fight having taken place at Ironbark last Sunday afternoon, " when not the ghost of a policeman could be seen." We should hope not indeed, we don't expect to see ghosts of policemen or otherwise, promenading the streets in broad-daylight. We advise our correspondent to look out for ghosts at midnight, as that hour is more congenial to disembodied spirits, than the hour he erroneously looked for them.
