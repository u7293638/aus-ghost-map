ALL A MISTAKE. ~T By "TOOT." [ïROM THE *<iTJEENSLA.ÍÍDEB.,3 I am that most unhappy nf mortals, a soft-hearted flirt. Now it is the greatest mistake possible for a flirt, especially one who meets with some little success, to be soft-hearted; she should be adamantine if she wishes to^escape a great many pricks and stings of remorse. Now 1 am des- perately fond of flirting-it is useless to attempt to deny it-and always enjoy the affair thoroughly until the crisis comes, and I suddenly hare it unpleasantly thrust upon me that the flirtation is all one-sided, and the other fellow is in solemn downright earnest. I liare had several of these rude shocks, and I must confess it, some very narrow escapes of having to say yes when I wished to say no. You see I always feel so sorry for the poor things, and pity is akin to love, so that some- times I almost persuade myself, when I find how much they really do like me and »ll that sort of thing, that I do feel some small little vestige of fond- ness in return. That is where my, tiresome heartlcomesj in, and runs me into all sorts of scrapes. So far how- ever, T have always managed to collect my senses just in time, and succeeded ia making ,them understand somehow, tbfagh generally in rather a discon- nected sort of way, that they are labouring under a delusion. They always ar« * labouring nuder a very strong delusion, because, you see, being, mo kind hearted I never can bring myself to give their feelings any nasty jars ; besides which, until the «rash comes,;I always persuade myself that they are only amusing themselves; that the whole thing is just as, much fun for them as for me, and that it is, ?pry good of toe to help them to pass their spare tijlnëin such an entertaining manner. I dare say I ought to» ¿now better, having had some little , e^peri once, and no doubt disinterested observers might call me rather blind. Perhaps I am Jost a. tiny little bit wil- fully blind;; ?% know I am nöt all Xi might be, and do not think of the consequences until too late-because when you come to think of it,it is very difficult to draw back ont» you are i fairly launched in á flirtation,. If you become suddenly distant and cool the man probably jumps to theksonelusion j tfcat you imagine .Leis going to break j bis heart about you-7-^ëreas be 'map) be in no jfa^^^$($r"- 'Pkénpt, course be jeers at you inwardly.

It does not matter how much I may protest tb the con- trary, they «till persist in regarding me asa kind of angelic being whose SOIB foult, if it ^ay be so called, lies in being too go6d for this, earth, and; therefore unable >to re^prowte lôve like common mortals, and only capable of spreading itlike some vast mantle , over mankind in general Kow ! am certain 'ti^^rßtijfi*' at this ridion^ IOHS conclusion because th^ by appearances. I look good. v|[«èvi bfeen told so eeores<»f times, *nd have ^^^^^^^^^^^^ sions appertaining to the feelings implanted in my heart carno to be imprinted in my face, all the other qualities came and took their allotted places ; thèo, after they were all settled down, the softness of heart, which had held back to the last, came and spread itself in an impenetrable surface layer over all- effectually hid. lng from the outer view all the vanity, love of admiration, selfishness, and other unpleasing expression* which £ know must be there somewhere. Of course, when people believe in one so j thoroughly, it is rather hard to have to do one's best to undeceive them, and that is how the horrible predica- ment carno about that I now find myself in, and which happened in the I following way :-? About six weeks ago I was intoduced in the usual commonplace way to Ernest St. Lawrence. We «ere at a dance, and our waltz steps happened to suit each other to perfection. This was, ot course, a most natural reason far dancing a great deal together on this and several other occasions of the same kind, and also, for deriving great pleasure from jibe said. dances. Be- fore very long Mr. ST. Lawrence took to visiting wy mother, and she, not caring greatly about entertaining young men, left the lion's share of the task to me. I seemed to succeed very fairly in it, and fancied that Mr. St. Lawrence appeared pretty well satisfied with the arrangement. I was quite çpotent, and my work was not hard, he being an unusually amusing and clever man. I think J forgot to mention that he was very good look- ing too. i used to sing to him and he to me ; and after a time 1 noticed he phbse very eentimen tal touching melo- dies. One little German song iq paTticuiar seemed to breathe love in e^ery iiote of it, »nd, as he sang it, nl#^ys gay¿> my heart a strange sort ofaching feeling; twp or three times jwhen he had finished I found the tears standing in my eyes, and once he looked round and saw them, which was unfortunate as it probably gave rise to wee ideas in his wind-and yon see I was not altogether sad ; X could not exactly say what the feeling was like which it gaye me ; I call it the German feeling, though I don't spppose ¿bat all Germans have that kind cf feeling, even when they hear their own songs sung-but, then, they have not heard Ernest sing them, and besi^ei!-Butil am x^mbHng, horribly,; and. j really do not seo why I shouíd say nice things about Mr. St. Law. renee's singing, or anything that he does,'considering the horrible dilemma he llas forced me into. I feel just at presentas if I loathed the man and everything connected with him; What right had he to fall in love with the, and then behave io such an over- bearing way as to make me say and. do all sorts of things I never meant ? However, I don't want to los» my temper j it won't do any good, and aliyays makes me feel very foolish after- ; wards;} but I cannot help being very; wretched, and my .poor dear brain, which I am sure was never meant for hard, work, has almost broken down under the strain ot trying tp devise means to extricate myself from this unforeseen and unwelcome of engage- ments. YeB, that is the undisguisable unpalatable truth. %' have unmean- ingly, idiotically, though I trust not i irrevocably, engaged myself, against j my better judgment and sense of what was right, to Mr. St. Lawrance; and all because of the mistaken kindness of the, flabby bit of sponge called a heart which beats (if it has the" strength to-I should think it only wobbled, poor feeble thing that it is) jib iny anatomy, and which prompted j«fc!4pi'say yes. for fear nf wounding his feelings. Of ooaree $>1tmm. ;not care for him, and why i should ho isacrifioedtoavoid giving him pbin I jijspjr* cannot ' *ee. . Bttcb ;. £! ¿ttafj&$:j not blame bim-t know it is not faíríjí: fit was not hiB^lt^t minj an^ ? partB from the truth, eo it does notl trouble me io the least-except that ; when be laughs atine, which he does < very often-though I must say it is in ? a very nice kind of way-I alwaysfeel an unconquerable longing to hit bim. ' I did it once. I bit very bard indeed ; but he put up his hand to ward off the hiow, and somehow or the Other caught mine in it-and-well, it was not released quite as soon as I could have wished, so I never repeated the experiment. Talking of Mr. St. Lawrence depart, ing from the truth", reminds methat I nae vdeparted a good deal from the thread ot my narrative. Ianiauite sure if I had been King What's-his-name £ could never have found roy way into Rosamond's Bower, because I never can follow a thread; I go off at a tangent every few minutes. But I really will return to the point, and try to keep to the poor neglected thing. The great point is pf course that l um engaged, and I dpu't wa^t to be en- gaged ; furthermore, l am determined to get out of it somehow, though I am afraid, in order to do so. I shall have to make him thing very badly of me, and £ shall be awfully, sorry to do that. If X can succeed in making bim con- sider me so horrid tbat he will be not only willing but glad to gita me up, I ara sure I sbiaU feel very wretched about it, because I value bis good opinion very highly, an4 really like him very, much as a friend ; but it has to be done somehow, and this very day, becauee he is coming to see me this afternoon, and I cannot possibly let him go away without opening bis eyes to tbp true state ofafeiirs. I only hope it, won't make him very misérable, I am intensely sorry to think that our pieasant friendship is ail over. It w:as oer^inly very plea- sant--no ^Iway* seeme4¡.é?¡ l^8; to undjçfstand each other %proaghly, and haçï so' many ,ÍáBÍ^4q'wfWPW.I and hé-cópfided iil^iiiis bopes and as- pirations to «ne, and ev^n ^eá t0 ap- peal to me for advice, which I ana afraid wat), a w^ste of ti«j°0 on bis part, as, although¿se4 to. givip bim, a great many of; wha<t. I, considered T?rj -excellent samples of the commodity, still I am,sure ho would ajways have done exactly what was right without them ; he being a mßBt right-thinking young mari in everything, fxeept as regards myself, where he *rrs greatly, being under the idea tbat I aín almost as attached ¿o him as. he is to me, which I believe ÍB not a little. . When he came in yesterday evening I was sitting ©ut in the gardeb, luxu- riating io the moonlight ; and, being by this time on terms bf much inform maiityv I let him go, after a few words, into tho house by himself to say Blow do you do ? to mother. She was feel ing very tired after an arduous after- noon of call-making, and in a few minutes despatched him back to me. He wa« unusually silent, ana I exerted myself manfully 'tocheer bim lip; ia fact I frivolled so that! verged on the idiotic ; but, though bb laughed oc- casionally, it seemed to be under pro- test. At last I got rather tired of piping without rousing my hearer,to any terpsichorean display, and I told him that I considered hé was behaving in a manner thflt was gloomy and dis- agreeable* ' I feel gloomy and dis- agreeable,' was the discouraging reply, which so took me by surprise that I could only feebly ask, * Why?' * You know why'*-rather dolo, rously. .I don't know; tel! me why,* 1 answered, perhaps just a tiny bit too softly, looking round at bim with up- turned eye». loBtead of replying be Jumped up from beside me and walked bastir} down to the garden gâte, on which bi leant bis «rms, and remained standing for some minutes. I^as a good deal surprised, but remarked airily when he returned: ?r-.;-. ¿ -:$ liamma enjoyed fpút stroll.1 to remarks, and l^rblapsèf into « you know I am greedy--and moon- light, and the luxury of railing asleep, and music, and pneVfrienfo-~tbough you do not seem to derive much eolaoe from them ; or at any rate not 'from the caty one whose wolace is available just now.' * Friends !' was the contemptuous reply. * Who cares for friends V « I do.* I returned promptly, * I have lots of them, and I care for them all.' « All exactly alike?'-he asked. * Well, no, ' not quite exactly. For instance, I like Mr. Noble some shades bettor than Mr. Bostock,- be- cause hie moustache is fully a quarter of an inch longer ; and Mr. Bagshot, although very jolly cannot be classed quite in the front rank, because he persists in einging, and is very often hopelessly out of tune. I adore Mr. Cheeks, on occouct of his extreme entertainingneBs ; and little Jack Carr ÍB quite at the top of the list, for the sake of his general light-heartedness and the great ease with which one can amuse him. I cannot remember the particular characteristics of any more of them Just at present ; perhaps they have hot got any.' ; ' :i 'Oh, âp;,go!on. w^Jtt'è^iï gives me the greatest pliaiure io" listen to the admirable dualities of your numerous friends/ This remark. maa'^me^\^\k^^a^à^^''''^ *ï think you arp.Véïy cross,* t'satd; with a ghost of a trenible in my vp'icp;, and relapsed into a kind of resigned angelic silence. y < ¿ .?

I «011M not say no, but I «book my bead. Í think the moon was under a cloud just at «tbat moment, and he never ¿aw the movement of denial, for, as my silence continued, his arm tightened round me, and I was drawn closer to bim. I felt so ashamed of myself that I felt I must bide my face somewhere, and, as there was no other biding place available but his shoulder, I perforce mid it down there. * My sweet-my sweet!' he mur- mured. * My own-my love 1' and I felt something stir the curls on my bead. We were quite still for a mo- ment or two, and then I suddenly raised my head, and tried to draw away from him. .' Oh, let me go ! let me go !' I cried, fie only smiled. * Never, now,' he said ; * never!' There was a most alarming air of determination about him ; then, smiling still, he, with a hand under my chin, raised my face, bent bb down to it, and kissed me. 'And there/ he concluded, *is-a seal of dur compact.' ;Now this, of course was very dreadful, and what lam going to say will make it more so; but if I tel! the: truth I may as well tell the whole ' truth, andi acknowledge-that, at the time I did not seem to mind it; in fact I believe I rather liked, it, I look; back on it now with feelings of «corn and disgust, for, I regard it as the 'WWfrMi of Wi folly and feb« tri?y,WT" »rgnmept I shall have ¿o, encounter when I try to explain; malters.to-day.
