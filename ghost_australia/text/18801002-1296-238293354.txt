TIIE OPERA HOUSE. The farewell benefit accorded to "The Only Leon " at the New Opera House last night, was distinguished by three features — one usual and two especial — the first being the excellence of the pro- gramme provided for the entertainment of the audience, and the two latter the enthusiastic and overwhelming plaudits that greeted Mr. Leon upon his every appearance on tho stage ; and tlie debut of an artiste, Jlr. Sweetm'an whoso presence comes far too late in tlie season. It would.be " gilding refilled gold " to say that Mr. Leon was as usual juir exeelhnce tho beau ideal of actor, vocalist and dancer, and the applause that was bestowed upon him was ns cordial us it was well deserved. Of Mr. Swcotinan, it can only be said that lie nt once established himself as n prime favourite with the audience, nnd will prove a great acquisition to tho pre viously strong company organised by Mr. Leon. To-night Hcrr llandinann appears as Hamlet, supported by Miss Ho, -unlet ns Ophelia. Of this lady the New York Been ing Netrs says : — "Miss Louise Beaudet assumed the difficult part of Ophelia, nnd discovered an innate power and conception of tlie character, nnd vividly brought out tlie true delicacy aud perfection of tne charac ter. In the second act she displayed her fear j ami in describing Hamlet's appearance before her, after he lias met his father's ghost, the lines were given with true artistic excellence. In tho fourth aether madness was prescient with a wierd and sorrowing realism ; aud when she came in with the clustering branches nnd 6wcet Uowers, and sung lit' I, flor.'l mitt p.me, latljr, ID1 is ilr-nil and gone; At Ids houl u grass green turf. At tits licels a stone, the audience seemed transfixed by tlie wildncss of grief expressed in her tones." Tlie company, which has been orgnniscd by Mr. Bandmntin, in cludes a number of capable actors, foremost among whom is Mr. William Hoskins, who appears to night aa tho Ghost of Hamlet's father.
