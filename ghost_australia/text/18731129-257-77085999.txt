A New Sensation. — A new sensation has been discovered by a contributor to Chambers' Journal— ot perhaps it would be better to say that the sensation was forced upon him. He had never seen the interior of .St. Paul's Cathe dral, and, it being his' last evening in London previous, to his return to Australia, lie prevailed upon a grey-headed old man, so he says, to let him into the buildhur when the shades of even ing had gathered around it The colonist, who was left in the building alone, saw a few feet from the floor — not a ghost— but a rope dangling from the vast height above, and having been a famous gymnast in years gone by, he caught hold of it and found himself being drawn up, of course, to hts great horror. Suon he utmost lost possession of his sensts and his strength, expect ing every moment to be daihed to pieces. Ul timately he benaniu quite unconscious, aud when he 'came to, '' ho found himself on thejoor, with his grey-headed friend bending over him. It appears that the old man returned just in time to see the hero of this startling episode dangling in the air, that he whistled three times, just as he observed the workmen did when they wanted the rope lowered, the pulling up stopped, mid the rope came don-u, the culoni^t holding on till it nearly reached the floor again. If the story is not true il might be. Moral : When you go in to St. Paul's and nee a rope swinging from the roof, don't practice gymnastics upon it It is affiiWd that the world-renowned writer andhuiuorist, Mr Samuel Clemens, better known as ' Mark Twain,' lia-s intimated his intention of muking a ' very fast flying visit to Australia ' on the resuintion of the new mail service be tween California aud these colonies. He is at present iu London, engaged as special corres pondent, and writing a scries of sketches forthe New York papers.
