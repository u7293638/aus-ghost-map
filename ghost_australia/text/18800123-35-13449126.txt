Since re sympathy with Mr. Brown and party." The Rev. P. Firth was- requested to send a suitable reply. EXCHANGE WITH THE NEW ZEALAND CONFERENCE. The Rev. J. OSBORNE said, for some years he had had a wish to exchange colonies. At one time he desired to go to Victoria, but his way did not open in that direction. At the time he was seeking an exchange in Victoria, he found that the Rev. R. Bavin, of New Zealand, was seeking to come to this colony. Mr. Osborne believed he would be more useful and successful in New Zealand. Another reason was on the ground of health. As to Mr. Bavin, it was well known that he stood well in New Zealand, being secretary of the Conference. Mr. Osborne concluded by requesting the Conference to transfer him to the New Zealand Conference, with a view to receive Mr. Bavin in his place. The Rev. W. CLARKE had no wish to lose Mr. Osborne, but as he had so strong a wish in this matter, he would move that the request be granted. Rev. G. WOOLNOUGH, M.A., would consent to Mr. Osborne's request, but would not assent to his reasons. He should be sorry for it to go forth to the public that because Mr. Osborne had entered the ministry in this colony, therefore he could not get on here. Mr. Osborne was a man of force and ability, and could got on anywhere. The PRESIDENT, in putting the resolution, expressed his regret at the decision to which Mr. Osborne had come. He had watched his career with great interest and pleasure. The resolution was carried unanimously. A RIVERINA GHOST STORY. -The residents of this district (writes the Albury Banner) do not, as a rule, deal very largely in the marvellous, but there is nevertheless a bank dwelling on Mr. M'Alary'e selection at Tubbo, which has obtained the name of the " Haunted Hut." A correspondent sends the following account of the circumstances under which the name was given:-" It appears that a Chinese shepherd committed suicide on this wild spot, and was succeeded in due course by a Paddy of a highly credulous and imaginative turn of mind. Accord- ing to Paddy's depositions, the spirit of the defunct Chinese was decidedly corporeal in its tastes and habitues. It had a disagreeable penchant for billy tea, and was not above stealing cabbages and purloining ' unregarded trifles' of every description. This is altogether a new development of spirit visitation, and shows clearly and conclusively enough to the unbelieving mind that a ghost story may afford a most convenient pretext to any designing rascal who chooses to add to his own stock and store by trading upon the superstitious fears of the vulgar."
