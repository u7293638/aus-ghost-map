Astounding Locomotor Ataxia Care. DOOTORS PRONOUNCED CASE HOPE LESS. HELD TO BE SO BY MEDICAL MEN THE WORLD OVER. A PROMINENT SYDNEY M.L.A. BEARS TESTIMONY. (From the "Australian Workman.") Our representative mode his way to tlio home ol Mr. Thomas Jarvis, 45 Orown- lane, Ultimo. Mr. Jarvis is one of the best known residents of that thickly populated suburb. He was discovered nursing a baby, and his face declared him to be one of the happiest men in Sydney. In reply to the preliminary questions, he said: " You want to know all about my case ? Well, I am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts may be of value to those who are stricken as I was." " How long were you suffering ?" " About five-and-lialf years ago I met with an accident; I was badly eoalded while takiog a bath in Pitt-street, Sydney. From the date of the accident my health began to fail, and after four years of pradual develop ment of Locomotor Ataxia I was forced to give op my billet at the Glebe Island." " What were the symptoms ?" " Simply indescribable. The pains were something terrible. They were for all the world like as if a saw were cutting my bones iu two in every part of me. 1 bad no control over my bowels or bladder, and was a nuisance to myself and every one else. I was inces santly shivering and shaking, and could neither eat nor sleep. I saw a well known doctor, and he told me that my case was ut terly hopeless. "I came home and vent to bed, and have been in bed pretty veil ever since. A few weeks ago I oould not walk across the floor; in fact, I oould nof get out of bed. I felt then that it nag all over with me, and only a ques tion of days when I would give up the ghost. My doctor waB attending me, and did all he could, by morphia pills, to eaae the agony I was in. I waB under him for five or six weeks. He came to the conclusion that I was Buffering from Locomotor Ataxy, or Progres sive Locomotor Ataxia, a disease of the spinal cord, oharaoterised by peculiar disturbances of gait, and difficulty in co ordinating voluntary movements. He told me that I migfet last for ten years, and that I might never get the use of my legs." (Just then the patient kicked his legs about with energy, to show that medical opinion is not infallible.) " Well, just as a drowning man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an idea conveyed by the advertisement describing the cure effected in the case of another boilermaker in England, which I read in the " Australian Workman," by Dr. Wil liams Pink Pills tor Pale People. I read in the advertisement of a case whioh seemed to fit my own. I determined to give Dr. Williams' Pink Pills a trial anyway, and sent for a box. The effeot was magioal. I was able to eat and Bleep as though nothing was the matter with me. It was the first appetite and rest I bad for many a day. It was icoredible. I immediately left the bed and was able to move about. When taking the fifth box, I was able to walk about with the aid of a etiok and was gradually but surely recovering my former vigour ana vitality. You see those cratches there 1 They are perfectly new, and I have never need them. They were made for me before I got the Pills, but I was too weak to use them, and I dont want them, and now I dont want them." Mrs. Jams, who bad come in and taken the baby on her knees, said Dr, Willi&mt;' Fink Pills saved his lite and mads another man of him." A friend who called in at this point said that Jarvis looked ten years younger that day than he did a short time back. " I oan now," continued Jarris, " have a oold bath, and all the feeling has oome back in my legs. I expect shortly to resume work as a boflermaker, and yon know I have to be in the very pink of health and strength to work at that trade. I am better to-day that I have : been at any time during the past five years. I asoribe all the ohange and benefit to these Pink Pills. They have saved my life. I am in'no pain now whatever, and teel like a new man. On the mantlepieoe there is a box of Opium and Morphia PillB vrhioh the dootor gave me to deaden the pain. But they oan Btay where they are, for I no longer need them: Everybody who knows me has been amazed at the change in me. They can bardly believe their eyes. Uy being about again has cansed quite a sensation here." WHAT MB. LABOR-LEADER M'GOWEN KNOWS Mr. 3. 8. T. M'Gowen, M.P., leader of the labor party in the N.S.W.
