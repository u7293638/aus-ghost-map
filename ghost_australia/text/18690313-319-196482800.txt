LAW AND POLICE. ? ??- ? '? — — — — -$- — : ? NISI PRIUS SITTINGS. (Before, the Chief Justice f&nd; a Special Jury ; ;??.' of Twelve.) ALEXANDER V. JONES. ??'-? ?'- ' ?' ?'' 'TMlRD DAY.- ' ' ' ' '.: ' ' 'I ' :j[ Saturday \fttli March. ' ?' ?? ..'Charles Edwin Jone3, the defendant, being called, stated , that : he saw the plaintiff on .the,:j12th: February, 18G7, but he had :noj .conversation with him on that day or previously. He was pointed put , on that day to witness in Collins-street.. Witness said he did not want to see Alexander, and if he. wanted witness he must come to him. Alex ander afterwards went- over to the Parlia ment uouse, ana iney went into a room. a.e said; he was afraid witness would not gat a' hearing at the meeting, and he wished to help him ; that Mr Murray Smith would be on the platform with him. , Witness said he talked like a fool, because if he could not get a hear ings Mr Murray Smith oould not help him. It was not true , as Alexander had said, that he wished; to get up opposition meet ings. The statement that he (witness) said he had so much influence with the working classes that he . could raise the meetings . was false. Mr Alexander's statements about money, or about all other. matters, where they differed from his (witness's), were false. Mr Alexander once called' at : his (witness's) house, in Young-street. He left Gore-street in June, 1867. Mr Alexander certainly never, to his personal knowledge, entered his house in Gore-street. Mr Alexander had often sent in his card ia the House to him, but as he found that Alexander merely wiBhed to proffer him ad vice as to the lino of conduct he should adopt in the House, he declined at last to go out in reply to his notes. When Alexander called he asked witness to give some information or evidence respecting the Police Court proceed ings against Mr Wheeler, tb en member, for Creswick. On 7th February, 1868, he went again to witness's honse and said he had been re quested ' by his ; party to call and see if he would take charge of the general election,: and if he would, money would be no object. Witness told him that the views of his party and himself were altogether dissi milar, and they could not work together. Spoke to Mr Randell on the evening of the day after the budget speech had been delivered— rthe 5th February. They walked home together from the House, or rather he walked home with witness. He agreed with witness in denouncing the tariff, and mentioned several instances in which the tariff would operate , injuriously on some local industries. He particularised the duty on piece goods. .Witness said he meant to oppose the tariff. Never re membered walking with Randell in Bourke streot . to ; Elizabeth-Street, as ho . had said, or ever, having such conversation as he said had; taken pjase. He had not at anytime asked Mr Randoliif the Free Trade party had any money. Might have said that Mr Lang ton was not the man . for the business of eleo- ' tioneering. On the 5th February Mr Randell offered to, subscribe £5 for. an agitation for. political purposes. Had not at any time made the remarks which Mr Randell said he had about Mr M'Culloch being uuprinoipled, or about, Brodie either. Randell never said wit ness could rely . on having £100 and that, he only , interested himself as a man, of business in Colling wood. Randell did not call at his house on the 1st February. Witness might, some timo have spoken angrily of Mr Francis, but he did not do so on the 1st Feb ruary. It was absolutely untrue that he had any such book as Randell had said, containing debtor and creditor aocount of members of Parliament. The witness, on the 13th Feb ! ruary, tno aay oeiore tue meeting, wrpie. to Mr Randell ? a letter. That was the one which had been, referred to about the Pasoal lamb. It was on the 5th that Randell had promised him £5. Mr Jenner was asked to preside; at the meeting in St. George's Hall, but he would not. Somewhere about that time ? he wrote a second letter to Mr Randell whioh was about some samples whioh Mr Randell had 'offered to get for him for. his speech on the : tariff question. Randell never called on kim inconsequence of the second letter. .The samples were furnished, but not in time for the speech, and witness afterwards used them in_ committee. Did once ride in a cab in Colling wosd with Mr Randell. He then referred app .ldgetically to' the £5, to which witness replied 'all right; all right.' Believed he (witness) also spoke somewhat angrily against Mr Jenner for not taking the chair at the St George's* Hall mooting. Never hoard tho expression about the briBtling Scotch hillock, or anything like' itj' until 'Randell made it before the, Parliamentary Committee. (A great number of the remarks mado in' evidence by Mr Randell were read to witness by Mr Higinbotham, who aBked if they were1 true, and he denied them in overy material point. Besides' the' letters published there was an understanding that Randell's costs were to : be paid, but the' record wasto:be 'with- drawn, and the ploa of justification was to remain.' The statement that he received mo ney1 ' from Alexander waB false. ? He never- re ceivod 'money from him on any account what- ' ever. Was willing to obtain his bank pass book ' for the jury, or a copy of it, or any information about his account from the 9th February to the 20th. He had asked' for the paBB book, but was never at any house of his when Mr Long more wag there'. ? . CroBS-.examined by Mr. Follows : Recollected beingproseouted for perjury at the police court; inl8Gl or in 1862. . The defence was ih-et that ?1iq neyer made any such defence onoath, aud( next on any occasion. The oh'arge was' dismissed. Rees obtained a verdict againt witnoBB for a libel. Ho would not have had n vordict against him if ho had remembered that it was his leaving the .. Railway department, ? and not ;. tho town-clerkahip; that was so discreditable to him. Knew ' a person' named Nash* Did not owe him any money. Nash was in his employ, and he never owed him any money he had not paid. Might have made the mistake of putting the name of Nash instead of ' self ' to : a cheque. If Nash had such a oheque, he could , : not account for it without something to refresh ? his memory. Supposinghe had such a cheque, witness would pay it. (A letter of Mr Robert Bennett, formerly Mayor of Melbourne, pub lished in a Melbourne paper of the 13th November, . 1861, was here readj. Did not proseoute Mr Bennett' for the libel because he beard that he was not worth powder and shot. He, however, challenged Ben nett to an inquiry , which went on not withstanding Bennett shirked it, and it re Bulted unanimously in his favor. Was not then more in want of money than tailors i.ju ally are. Borrowed two sums of £100 each about ;that time at 26 per cent. Had borrowed money as high as 40 per cent. Gave security .', for the loans he had mentioned. Paid £80 ; of the money borrowed .and forfeited the Be- :?; curity. Ho assumed it was all;paid off, becnuso . the ? persons who sued him for what they called . the balance, withdrew the record. Mr Follows was then witness's counsel. ? (Laughter.) Hjls defence was that they kept the cloth iiwbioh was the security bo longas to render it valueless ..' through being moth-eaten, &c;, and also tnat the pawnbroker's license waB ante dated. Did not at the time know that Fischell, who ? managed the.pawnbroking business, was .cheat- / ing the directors of the company. Was not aware that the directors did not know of his ? having borrowed the money. He carried on business until May, 1864. Some - of the creditors were not paid in fulh One of his creditors bought the others out, and he poid him in full, and 10 per cent., together with the amount he paid to ethers, and 10 per cent, on that. Paid that creditor in the latter end of 1864. The creditor bought the estate be fore May, 1864. At the end of 1864 ha offered himself as a candidate for Ballarat East. His constituents paid his expenses. Did not, to the best of his. belief, then receive £40 for election expenses from an Orange Society. Had received money for political purposes — £400 a year at one time. He had, also re ceived £50 once from his constituents. Did not remember receiving any. money on behalf of any other candidate:; at an election. Remembered ; the ; election at Maldon. ' Then got £60 .to pay Lieut. Amsinok's deposit at the ,:MaMon:; elec tion. .Did not receive £20 from Mr. Ams4 nek. The action Randell v. Jones was 'settled for £250. : It was to have been settled for, £150, but when Mr Kyte died advantage was taken of it, and the price was made £250.; Did not get £200 from Mr Batters i to vote ; on . the bill tp quiet titles. Knew it had been whispered that he had received the money, but it was altogether false. He voted :, for the second reading of the .bill,, and .moved an amendment on it, in committee, where it died. ? Never wrote, a letter, in whioh. he asked for money, from soft goods houses. Would again swear he never had such a book aa had been mentioned about mem bers of ? Parliament. Had a scrap book in which he pasted remarkable speeches. The speeches , were mostly his: own; :. ' (Great laughter.) It could; easily be produced, if it was wanted. The sacrifice the Pascal lump was ; ready for was to ; be. howled down at the meeting at St. George's Hall, and the money- mentioned ??; in the . letter waB the £5 Randell had promised . and which - he. wished to obtain to prevent his having to pay all the expenses. He promised .the £5 towards holding ;, $ie , meeting in ' St. George'B Hall, jjandpll Vsras interesttd along with himi bec'ause.'he said iie would rather have a thorough protectionist tariff than the one propounded. He would uso Mr Riudcll as far as. he would go hia way., ''Ho did not thon want such a ' dosp'7 of' protection as Randoll said in a letter that he wanted. Nevor made any statement, to Randell about the Jew being kind.- Was, ready, to join with the freetraders if they were iaoe-H;ne8t about their ^profeBaions respecting what they would bo willing to pjivo as proiebtion. He belie v.ed the letters to Ran dell had not been . destroyed, and did not believe now that, they had. Was quite con vinoed that, they' were still in' existence. Could not ascribe any reason why a'l the witnesses had conspired against him; The surveyors who made the measurement of the height of his window were incorrect; it waB Bix feet from the glass to the footpath. Ho never stated that a person looking out of the window, could not be seen by persons ?n the street. He might, perhaps, sometimes, have opened a door if the servant had not done so.' The servant made a wrong; statement when she ? said he often did bo himself. Peterson was wrong in his datca, and wherever his state ments differed from witness's it was wrong. To Mr Higinbotham : Mr - Randell often took , part in penny' readings, and wit ness thought he had given recitations from ' The Merchant of Venice.' Had heard that Randell had played the ghost in 'Hamlet.' (Laughter.) To Mr Fellows : Never heard of the charge about the £60 before the meeting on Soldier's hill. Could not remember whether he heard of it at a committee meeting previous to the Soldiera'-hill meeting, but ho thought he had not. To Mr Higinbotham ; First heard of the rumor about his receiving £200 to vote' for tho Quieting of Titles Bill from Mr Casoy, whe said he had hoard of it from Mr Fruncia.' Mr Francis did not wish to be dragged into the matter, and would not bo dragged iuto it, so witness said to Mr Casey, ?« See1 Batters, and ask him yourself about it.' Casey said afterwards that he had Been Butters,1 who said it was a (adjective) lie ; that lie never said anything ot the kind,' and 'Williams had made the statement against him because he (Williams) was not elected mayor just before the Prince came. He' (witness)' would swear he never received a shilling irom any person in respeot of the Quieting, of Titles. Bill. ??' Mr Kyte died on the inPrhing of the day before the trial ' of Randell and -Jones was to have come off.1 Did not at ' the Mal don election receive; £50 on his own account respecting the election. In regard to pledging the gooda to the Mont de Pieto, ef which Fischel was the manager, he stated that it was Fischel who used a wrong riamo instead of witness. It was at his wish the Parliamentary committee was appointed, but ho' did not move for it, because, in that caao he would have been the oh airman of it. 'Hd gave' more than a cor-1 responding quantity of goods to the Mont de Pieto for the money they advanced, and he ploaded that to tho action. He got a verdict on the politioal question of the Rees v. Jones trial, John Sntton, clerk in the Bank of Austra lasia, produced an extract of C. E. Jones and Co.'s account, showing a credit balance on 31st January, 1867, of £8 19s 2d. There was -6nr!PeBruaryr13*,'^'oa*sh paid in,' S^'Ss'lOd j' vtotalj,£54 83.

The case was continued on Wednesday, during' the whole of which it'laBted, tho time being 90-; copied by the examinatijon of witrieBses for^ the. defendant, the speeches of. counsel, and tl e Bumming up of the judge. The articles tho value of which was disputed- ore bo often Hiade up differently, es regarda V^aMj and cost of components that the widest latitude had to be allowed to witnesses on both sides in submitting their estimates. The evidence in that respect had ^consequently., to be^taken.. only ''for what it' was worth,' and it was ap parently ^rendered less reliable because ' of its over abundance,' there being a great deal ten ?.dered which was irrelevant. - ? ?? ' ' ??' ; ?? .The1 Chief' Justice,' in summing up, 'said he wasivery ;glad; a jury; of twelve Melbourne .merchants .had to try the case, because it was one. in which it was necessarjr for men iio con-j aider oaref ally- all the deductions that hai been presented on the different sides, and they would be Cable to see what meaning' should be placed ;on the deductions. The real question for them; i to decide waB- whether the amount set down in the short invoice :was a fair value :as Gefc down in the act ; that was, a fair market' value.in the prinoipal markets of- the country whence the goods were exported, with Jen per cent, 'added. Allusion had 'been made to the practice adopted in tho case of transhipment, but he' thought they could not consider thai these goocb had, been transhipped, as they had not merely been dealt witbVas1 in ordinary^ran shipments, buthad been: taken1 out 'of tub' ori ginal bulk and re- manufaotured, in some in btances boiledi ' The articles' must therefore be considered as thpugh.they were New South' Wales articles ;and then it.must.be considered, what were the values in the principal : markets of New South Wales, and in doing so i they would have to take the value in Sydtey, i which seemed to be about the only principal; 1 market in that colony *? The' evidence .given' by the diiferent witnesses ? had . been .' given1 ? without their having examined the 'chutney [01 other articles, and therefore ( was r only -So°far -valuable. It had been Baid; that' the sending -of a 'speoial invoice for 'the;1 Customs was 'of ?itself a fraud, ? and, perhaps 'it^.in'ight ?ibe open to that : ?'

The document ought not perhaps to ?have been called -an- invoice yet fetiirhowlwas ?the defendant in:any- other way to convey the ?amount he declared to' be thofair Value'1 ib Sydney? Respecting the deductions which had been made us to tbe value of- tbo goods' in; Sydney; he :would Btippbse' im 'instance, and're '?mind - the ' jury that the ?difference .between the smaller invoices and ; the ..larger orieB was about oa. one' to'tvvo.' « S'apposing' the'-de} if endant sent i :£100 ! worth of - goods ;: Sydney ivalue,. he would, according to that Truleirequire to obtain £200 for1 them' delivered1 here free', but hewould have ' to pay' all ch'argea.' The larger invoice in that case would be £200; and the smaller £100.' The :charges for freight on the £200 ' invoice ? - wonld ; amount to ? at ! least £30, ; which1 would 'reduce1; the. sum to £170. There 'was ;an 'invoice' ii court of goods ; 'Sent to ; 'Mr 'Service^ in whioh the charges amounted to:much iriofe'. Fromthe £170 there' would have to be deducted^ £17 for duty; which would leave -'the. dmbunt | at £163, or £53 over the- amount stated'in1 the smaller invoice. How then'1 did they account ! for the ; £53 -ever the, £100 in' the lower in voice?' In1 considering that/ they wbu'Id { have i to reckon the defendant's travelling, ex^- ! penses,' -or those of1 his ''keeping5 ' 'an i agent here. The travelling expenses Hwere j fairly chargeable, 'as he had to; come -here1. ! There '- was also the cost of the edses'1 nPt ? reckoned, and then the r defendahtV'prbfit .'for ! labor and skill ; and respecting profit they must consider whether ' the1 defendant would require a larger amount for the' risk of allowing debts in another '? country. They : wodld : see if 'by those means! or other deduetioris which might require to be made,, the sum of £53 would be reduced to so small an amount as to meet the evidence that had' been given 'respect^ ing a fraud having been committed. 'They would require to'consider wbat' the defendant meant by tbe word 'reali'':in the letter h*e sent to Watt, as also the statement of Watt that he thought the defendant had 'set'' down what the articles oost him when imported in bulk'in'Sydney.
