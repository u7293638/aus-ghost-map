Old Devices of Photographers. There are various ways for providing sur prising leaultn in photography, things that in one age would have been called magic, but m ours, recognised us soientitio tricks. Tbe ghost piotpre, for instance, in which a shadowy glioat — through which material objects are visible — iB seen between natural latitudes and OCOUDationB. That in nrnrinnpri by an almost inutuntaneoaB exposure of the figure that ia to do duty as the ghost, fol lowed by a full exposure of the figures and properties that are to appear natural. Another novel trice was shown recently in a photograph reproiuoed by a prominent trade journal; which presented the proprietor eetftcd at a tublef pluyiug cheaB with himself, sitting on the opposite side of the table,while he, himBelf, stood up in the background loutting at his two Belves playing. The figures were all on the negative, whioh was produoed by the successive exposures of the plate, partB thereof being masked ouah time oy a black velvet shutter. Still another oort of trick is that by which apeieon who likes tbat sort of thing may ap pear to be photographed riding upon a fly ing goose, or a fish, or any other desired Btyle of ridiculous locomotion. This is done by the subject holding upon his lap a huge piece of white or Bky- tiuted card with the fanciful figure drawn upon it. His face appears above the upper edge of tho oard, und seems, in the picture, joined to the funny little body mounted on the goose or fish. Tbe Btatue pioture ib made by about the same devise.
