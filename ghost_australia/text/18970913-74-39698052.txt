AN ESCAPED FEYER PATIENT. John Carroll, aged 19 years, whose mind had been affected by illness, es caped from the Ballarat Hospital at two. o'clock on Wednesday morning. He was only recentsly admitted as a patient at the institution, and on Tues day night when his delirium mani fested itself he was, mainly for his own safety, manacled and strapped to his bed. In effecting his escape, Car roll, who, is a resident of Bungartfe, went towards Ballarat East, and at thrt e o'clock a miner, returning ,home ward from work, observed him on the Queen-street bridge. He was clad only in a night-dress, and the miner on first observing the white object on the bridge became somewhat alarmed, as he thought he had encountered a "ghost." Accompanied by an acquain tance, whorm he aroused from bed, the miner ultimately advanced towards the bridge. Carroll, on seeing the men approaching, jamped over the parapet, falling 30ft. int.o the railway cu;tting below. Senior Constable Nedwell, officer in charge of -the Victotia-street police station, was then inform?Ed of what had ,ccurred, and on descending the railway cutting 'he found Carrol in a state of collapse, with blood flowing from a severe wound on the back of his 'head.' As Carroll appeared to have been badly .injured he was con voyed back to the hos~ital, when it was found thatt his jump from the bridge had been attended by serious consequences, as in addition to the wound on the head, he ihad also his thigh and arm broken, besides sus taining painful contusicns to the body. Some time ago (remarks the "Age") a typhoid fever patient escaped from the -hospital, and was subsequently discovered walking in Lake Wen-douree in 4ft. of water. She: "Oh, James, how grand the sea is. How wonderful. I do so like to hear the roar of the ocean." He: "So do I, Eliza beth. Please keep quiet."
