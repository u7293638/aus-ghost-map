The special general district meeting of the Wesleyan Church, convened for the purpose Of considering the heresy case preferred against the Rev. John Osborne, of the York- street Obarev, agreed totiw following find ing After nearing B£r. Osbome'a frank declaration of his belief in the Deity of Uie Lord Jens Christ and Hk atonement for am by SB* death ;m the deity of the Holy Ghost; in the plenary inspiration of tiae Holy Scriptures, and in the effieaey of prayer, and having heard also of hi* sincere attach, ment to the Methodist doctrines generally embodied in our acknowledged standards, we cordially accept his statements as full and satisfactory. At the same time we regret that his method of presenting these truths is at times so inapt as to produce the im pression on tiie minds of some that he is erroneons in doctrine. Second—ln reference -to the sermon delivered in the Tork-itnet Church on Sunday evening, April 22, on Bonan CMbolicism, we are con vinced that Wb. Osbotne is sound in the doctrines of Protestantism at held by the Mftf'^*^** Church, yet from the evidence we are astirfSed that in the former part of his diacuiiME he was so' unguarded in fail etaUmentaav to appear to advance doctrines BOtinfammc?y with cur standards.
