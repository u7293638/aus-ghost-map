CREMORNE. A NEW FERRT SERTICE. This morning for the first time since over forty years ago a ferry steamer began to call at Cre morne— the Mosman's steamer only calling there 'wind and weather permitting and if needed.' The Mosman residents look on it as another* bur den to bear, as several minutes jare added to the length of the trip, but it- will probably hasten a twenty minute service. Cremorne was in its zenith between 1855-60, when a steamer used to call, and bring picnickers to' the pavilion, which remains ? now. m the form of ruins. The original grant was to Sir John Robertson's father, who built a fine house there, the splendid stone man telpieces of. which stood until recent years alone like altars under the trees. It is reported that the late Sir John used occasionally' to swim ever to Mrs. Macquarie's Chair ;with his clothes in a bundle on top of his head, resting at Fort Denison midway. This is a 'yarn' which the old folks, tell — to the children who grumble at the Mds man ferry service! Cremorne is celebrated for its coal bore, which ended not in smoke, as the promoters fondly hoped, but in visions,-for the al dermen of Mosman would not allow a coal mine so near their model suburb; anyway the coal was not perfect. Campers and boating parties will not be so happy at Cremorne now that the steam--, er calls. .Roads will be opened up promptly, and houses will be put up quickly on. this site. When the land was sold, subject to the possibility of. 100ft reservation, it fetched great prices; but on the 100ft' reserve becoming a fact it lost in value very considerably.. It is all 'for the good of the public.' Cremorne is reported to have a well with a tragedy, hidden treasure, and a ghost. .
