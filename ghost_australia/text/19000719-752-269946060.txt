YANKEE HUMOR. An exchange tells a good story illus trating the sabtletles of the American joke, and the obtnseneaa of the foreigner In comprehending It. A German one day expressed himself as being Bomewhat offended because an American gentleman had asserted that bis Teutonic country men could not, as a rule, appreciate Ame rican jokes. “ Try von on me !” said he, defiantly, and the American accordingly told him the Btory of the tree ‘ out West ’ whioh was so high that it took two men to see the top. One of them saw as far as he could, and the second began to look at the spot where the first stopped seeing. The recital did not raise the ghost of a smile on the German’s face, and the other said to him ‘'Well, you Bee the joke Is lost on you. You can’t appreciate American humor.” “ Oh, but,” said the German, “ dat’s not humor. Dat’s von lie.” “And how did you and grandpa get along P” inquired the doting mamma of the preoooious child. “ He was pleasant as pie,” replied the cherub. “ As pleasant as pie 1” “ Yes, mamma. Short and crusty.”
