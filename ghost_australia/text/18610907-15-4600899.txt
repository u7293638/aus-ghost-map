SUGAR. Sin, Referring to the very able article which appeared in a late issue of your contemporary, headed "Sugar and Coolies," I think that an appendix showing the outlay and returns of a sugar plantation, say of 10 acres planted each year for three successive years, would be both interesting and service- able to the community. I therefore beg to hand you a statement for publication, with the few following remarks :? ¦ Now that the attention of the public is so much engrossed by the cotton question and its effects on Queensland, and while all agree that, with a regular supply of labor, the cultivation of the Cotton plant would be highly remunerative, there is also always the dread of the extra supply of labor failing at the precise time it is necessary to have it in abundance, and; at tho time of picking, so that as a product in the present state of the colony it will hardly bear favorable compari- son with sugar, which requires only the same number of hands that plant and clean the canes for its manufacture. With every desire to see the cotton plant flourish, and Queensland ranked among the great cotton growing countries, there is no reason why it should be so to the exclusion of an article of commerce of daily home consumption, and which will prove itself equally remunerative as the statement appended will clearly show. There is no reason why both should not be grown on the same estate, and I believe it would be advantageous if they were so, as after a crop of cotton the land would produce sugar of a better quality, and while the canes were coming to perfection say fourteen months after planting there would be already a return from the cotton. I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, THOMAS BOWDEN. Mdioisandum of the expenses for the cultivation and manufacture of ten acres of sugar cane, still \- year for three successive years, with the expected returns, supposing the land to be fit for the plough.

In my calculations I have reckoned to employ the same number of Europeans here as negroes in Jamaica. In estimating the return of sugar per acre I have taken the low estimate of 2 tons per acre for plants, and 1 ton for 1st ratoons, whorciiR in rich alluvial lands 3 tons for plants, and 2 tons for 1st ratoons might be reasonably expected. T. B. Sin,?It is not quite twelve months since Mr. Ogg sent you a contribution about the blacks, which for my life I could not understand. In the issue after that which contained it, however, he asked you to insert some corrections, which principally affected the grammar of his letter. You then informed us that most of the blunders of which Mr. Ogg complained (and for which he seemed to blame your composi- tors were actually to be found in his manuscript. This I believed, because he had not sent you all the corrections necessary to romer the letter a grammatical composition. I now beg to direct Mr. Ogg's attention to the following sentence in his letter, which you have in your issue of August 31st.:? "As the circumstances in which the statement was made, and confirmed by the highest official of another Presbyterian church (whose testimony I shall also quoted renders it final, allow me to refer to those by way of introduction." Apropos of national schools, Mr. Ogg might send you as his next contribution, a few lines giving the grammar of the words in italics. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, THE GHOST OF LINDLEY MURRAY.
