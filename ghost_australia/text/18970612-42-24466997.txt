LITERATURE Original Poetry Drought. Walgett, N.S.W. W.M. FLEMING. Old Drought, Death's dearest champion, Walks gauntly o'er the land; His teeth all white and gleaming, His weapons in his hand, And near and far his war-notes, The stifled groans of pain, Roll slowly to the welkin And echo back again. The dust, his rolling standard, Waves high across the runs, While throbbing thirst and famine, His two quick-firing guns, With callous claim and deadly aim Put peace and happiness to shame Till joy is but on empty name, And Hope the horror shuns. See! gloating o'er its suffering, With eager, straining eyes, He stoops above the struggler And mocks it as it dies With visions wild and joyful, Till, sure that joy is shown, With rattle weird and eerie He claims it as his own. Then, sweeping on in laughter, He calls; from far and wide The ghosts of bygone suffering Stream in on every side; And as they come, with moaning hum Through lips that struggle to be dumb, He sneers at most, but jests with some In very lust of pride. The skeletons of sorrow Beneath his baneful stare, With weary limbs and aching, Are all assembled there, And, by his mournful music, Awakened from their trance, With heavy feet and listless Begin to reel and dance. With hollow tones and mocking He laughs to scorn their dread; And now his teeth are gleaming A bright and smoking red. The revelry of misery Sweeps onward in its agony, Till life itself has ceased to beâ€” The empty earth is dead.
