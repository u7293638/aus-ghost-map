AN EXTRAORDINARY EXCUSE FOR AN ASSAULT. The Maldon correspondent of The Argus gives the following particulars of an assault on a female who was mistaken for a ghost:â€”" A few nights ago Mrs. Miller was returning home, and, whilst waiting for a frieud at a street corner, was passed by a young man, who, after going past her a few yards, returned, knocked her down, giving her two black eyes and inflicting other injuries. Before leaving, he told her he thought he had given her enough. On reaching home she informed her friends, who at once communicated with the police, but, as she could not give any description of the person who assaulted her, the matter remained a mystery. Reports had for some time past been current tbat ghosts have been seen in the neighborhood of the place where the assault look place, and the following morning a young man who delivers milk in the neighborhood appeared as usual, but with a bandaged and helpless hand, and informed his customers that he had been fighting with the ghost. This morning, on hearing that Mrs. Miller's cose was ia the hands of tbe police, be at once paid a visit to the sufferer, and on finding that she wan really the ghost he had attacked, he offered a most alj^ct apology. It is not known whether this has been accepted." __
