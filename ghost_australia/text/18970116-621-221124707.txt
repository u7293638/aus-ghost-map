A Srransre Story Explained. A very strange story comes from Dub lin. On the 'afternoon of the day of the sudden death of the Bishop of Killaloe and Mrs Wynne, a lady walking in one of the suburbs , of Dublin met a clergy- man whom she supposed to be the Bishop and inquired for Mrs Wynne. "She,'' was the reply, "is dead, and," after a pause, "the Bishop, too, is dead." The lady was quite overcome, and on recovering herself found that the clergy man, whom she had supposed to be the Bishop, had vanished. She immediately went, and explained the occurrence- to a , well-known Irish Protestant dignitary, who Is a firm believer in supernatural appearances. He said there was no doubt that she bad been accorded an in terview with the spirit of the departed Bishop. The story was extensively cir culated in Dublin society, and was told to a clergyman when visiting the family of a well-known judge. "Why," said the astonished cleric, "I am the Bishop's ghost A lady whom I had not known came up to me on road at that lime and asked me how Mrs Wynne was. I said she was dead, and that the Bishop was also dead.-Tlie lady naturally seemed greatly distressed, and I passed on." There Is a very striking likeness be tween tlie dead- Bishop and the clergy man for whom he was mistaken. â€” "Westminster."
