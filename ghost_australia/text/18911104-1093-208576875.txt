There were older scholars than Tom; casting sheep's eyes at'the teacher, who tfreite likely, if . riot carefully kept at the proper distance, to became far more annoying than he. She needed a foil, and, looking about her for the pupil toward whom she could manifest par tiality, with the least "likelihood of arousing jealousy, she naturally hit' upon poor, homely, shock- headed Tom. ; If some one of her admirers insisted 011 eSeorfc . ing . hereto this, tfyat, or the other place, she was always "sure to Have,- a. prior - engagement .'"with Tom.

"I don't know 'bout that," said Tom, earnestly. "That is to say, I-I-don't know [ 'bout that." , TI : ' She,la\%hed a, gay:little laugh.
