1bumoi\ The Boarding-House Joint. Each weary guest is worn to a ghost; Ob, list to our tale of woe! How we long for a rest from oar landlady's roast, Bat how she makes it go. Oh, sing me a hymn of the lasoioas ham, That never oar table sees! But only the limb of the ancient lamb Whose sequences are theEe: One day hot, and the next day cold, And the third day " Btew" is its name; And the fourth day haeb, but,the same old joint . It g6ts there, just the same. The markets groan with the fatted grouse ' The stalls o'erflow with fowl; I sometimes moan for a Chinese mouse, Or a slice of toasted owl. ' Bat ever the shape of the aged sheep On the table lies alone, And like funeral crape despair doth crcep As the same old rule gots on:*. One day hot, and the next day cold, ;r\ And the third to " stew" we sloop: And the fourth day hash, and the filth Ead day The bone is in the soup. If only the lamb were bred for the loom, , [ And his flesh was for food too coarse, I'd care not a darn for the lambkin's doom, No more than the horse-ear horBe. If the tariff tax would complete its tricks, And the price to heaven should scar, Such a state of facts would our landlady fix, And we never would grumble more: * One day hot, and the next day cold, And tho third day greasily etewid;:: And the fourth day hash-Will it ever reach Innocuous desuetude? .
