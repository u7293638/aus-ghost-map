The Mirrored Demon. A Weird Tale of the Black Pool at The Alders. Townrd tbo end of n 'cloudy aummcr dny, having slowly climbed to the top of n bill, thickly wooded with young pines, I anw nt lnst tbo gables nnd tnivcra of Tho Alders, nn estntu which occupies the fogpy bottom of tbo valley.. I,w/'j coming to take possession of this domain,, p l\ doned for forty years past to tbo insU'&'jcnt cave of n supornn nunted stcwai'.|. -~- Clio Into proprietor, my fnther, who btf! .' / I'jntly died and whoso heir I whs. Urging m'y X-i',*} forward, I commenced to nscena tK; -iii... Tbe grndo wna steep, and tho nrj'«5.i;« iron aboea slipped peril ously in tin- iilnso grnvel of tho ror.d. Under tlio dark nnd heavy sky, tho pines to right and left took on n gloomy huo ; below me, blurred in tbo lmze of tbo vnllcy, rose tho chiUenu, n dark nnd broken mnsa, which wna almost hidden from sight by tbo great forest nbont it, broken here nnd there with opon hontba nnd reod-fringed poola of n sickly greenish hue. I remembered that my fnther bnd nhvnys evinced n grcnt diatnato for Tbo Aiders; tho very nnmo mndo him shudder. A cold, drizzling rain wns now falling, nnd I soon felt very uncomfortable, for tho morning had boon fine nnd I hnd neglected to bring n top-cont or trnvolling wrnp. Arrived nt tbe foot of tho hill, I hnd to pnss through a littlo village o£ n hundred or a hundred nnd fifty homes, tho lnat cottngo extending -juito to tho main entrance of thn chateau. The noiao ot my horse's hoofa brought to the doors eight or ton po.isnnta, who stnrod nt mo curiously, but with no sign of n salutation. I nltributed to my long contemplntion of tho young pines, through which 1 bnd been trnvelling, the singuinr colorntion which certnin objecta nssumed in ray eyca j tbe nrma nnd fncca of tho rnisornble villngorB, who stnrcd nt mo with 'n cowed nnd brutish poraiatence, aeemod very sallow, nlmost green. A few women'a henda nnd bands 'allowed nmid tbo group of men. It seemed to mo thnt these bends nnd bands wero also sallow and green. Tho cMtoau gntea wero cloaed. Through tho bar, lepor-blotcbed with rust, could bo seen the great seigiicurnl court,'grown with rnnk weeda, nnd further tho nbnndoned chritenu. Tho rnin, become alinrper now, wns chilling mo to tho bone. I descended from my horse, tied the poor beast — which hung ita bend through aheer fatigue— to a ring mortised into the atono wall, nnd presently found the hfndlo.of n boll hnl£ concealed in tho intricate wrought-iron work of tho gato, I pulled it violently 8everal times; but in place of tbo expeoted choer ful peel, two slow, . heavy, and solemn strokes of nn n!nrm;boll-re3ounded omi nously in' the . .distant: gloom— for it wns nlrendy cluak', :.- ?^, . : ;'.r ' From a little 'lodge nttjio- right o£ tho cliatenii emerged nnpld.w'omnn, who held aloft a. liimp.

To see the roses in her cheokn, wo would hnvo given our lives, my poor wife nnd I. But she wns very pnle ; she went too often to tho odgo of tiio wnter. Sho loved — I do not know why — that' water, which harmed her ao. Often, when her mother cnllcd her to dinner, aho wns sentod in tho wet grass nt tho side o£ tho pool. Wo scolded her, but it did no good. It pleased her, sho said, to listen to tlio noiao of tho wind in tho rccda. Sho had nothing clao to nmuso hor, the ficnr child. In other countries, tho littlo girla of poor people can gnthcr flowors, peep in the birds' neata, nnd hava doves nnd piny with them na in tho picturea I hnvo seen in tbo city shops ; hero, air, there nro no other flowers thnn tbo liliea of tho pool, tho birds would be nfrnid to build their nests in our grant, gloomy trees, nnd tho only dovea nro rnvens. My poor girl, thon, loved tho pool. Sometimes, of nn evening, I would henr her open tho window of her cbnmber —tho chnmbor where you will sleep to night, sir. ' Coma in 'I' 1 would cry; 'go to bed, you will tnko cold.' 'No, no!' ahe would say ; nnd when I naked her whnt she tvna looking nt, ' Thero is n star in tho pool.' aho would nuswor. Ono morning nt tho brenkfnBt hour, Mndeloino did not como down stairs. Hor mother went up to her room. ' llndcloine is not hero I1 cried my wife. It wna n month ngo, ono Sunday morning. Mndeleino hna not como bnck yet.' Ohnrtier hnd spoken alowly, in n monoto nous tone. Now ho wept silently, ' Tho disnppenrnnco of their child more then nccounted for the gloom of my bosta. I repented bnving judged them bnrshly, nnd it waa with Bincerc pity that I pressed the old man's hnnda na 1 retired. My chninbor wna a smnll room, covered with n mouldy paper ; in ono corner nn iron bed, two cnne-sont»d clinira nt right nnd lcftoE a wnlniit commode, n portrnit of n young girl— Mndoloine, doubtless— fncing tho single window— thnt was nil. I went to bed nnd to Bleep, not without aomo difli culty, for tho stownrd'a talo bnd predisposed my mind to lugubrious thoughts, nnd then I thought of tbo fever which I drended oo. After an hour of restless sleep, I awoke with n atnrfc, 'Who's there?' I cried.' Tho lnmp, which I bnd not extinguished, ennbled mo to convinoo myself thnt I wns nlonc— nbsolutely nlono with tbo portrnit. From my bed, whore I could no longor sleep, I looked long nt this picture. ? It wna n young girl, very pnlc, drcBsed in white, in nn nttitndo oE moditntion ; aho gnzed nt the window with n strnngo earnestness. Aa one invohmtrily follows tho glnnce of n person nenr, I directed my eyes parallel to thoso o£ tue portrnit. Tho window bnd no curtnina ; beyond the pnnes nppenred vaguely tho .indistinct silhouettes of tbo forest, and iu tbe slindow thero was n single star. Turning bnck townrd Mndoleino, I noticed thnt her gaze hnd becomo more in tense, but it wns enay to cxplnin to myself, whyitaeemed ao : plunged for nn instnnt into tho night, my eyes should now See moro clenrly those of the portrnit, on which tho lamp shone full. Whnt I could not cxplnin, whnt 1 do not understnnd even yet, wns nn nlourd iden— the result, no doubt, of my nervous excite ment— which led mo to get up, open tho ansh, ns if in obedience to tho desire of the portrnit, nnd, the window open, turn back to it to receive its thanks. A brenth o£ wind which entered tho room extinguished tho lnmp, nnd tho portrait uisappenred. Without, the slindowa were profound ? benenth tho low nnd black sky vnat treca Btood out, terrible ngainat tho night, about a grent, palo apace in which shivered furtive, steely lights and the dimmed reflection of a. ainglo atnr— it wna tho pool; .vy.-.v ? ^'Shuddering, I knew not why, I gnzed nt the henvens, the trees, the pool Italent, butit.hvcd.,, I divinad-thnt a censoless n'i tntibn moved it, revenled on the smfnee by the trembling of the weeda ; atrnngc visions wbre-in'its inky depths, ahadowy drenma of tbnt slumbering wntcr whoso respiration rustled dolorously nmong tbe reods.
