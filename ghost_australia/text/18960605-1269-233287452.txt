another ghost. The Launceston Helegtvjph is again en deavoring to raise the ghost of provincial protection, in order to scare the guileless farmers off Federation. But it doesn't work. The far- mers know better than anybody can tell them that Customs taxatien in the guise of'protection to native industries is a hollow sham and a blatant mockery. They know that Customs duties provide the only legitimate excuse for the Treasurer to spare the unearned increment of the land monopolist. Hie protetionists and the land monopolists are fighting the same battle everywhere, which fact ought to open the eyes of the sleepiest farmer in Tasmania. Intercolonial freetrade means more extensive markets for Tasmanian producers. Of course, "it also means cheaper imports, and the consumers in all the colonies will benefit by the free exchange of products. Beyond the benefits of an extended market the Tasmanian producer will not gain any special advantages over the producers of other colonies. That is freely admitted. And wko wants special advantages ? Surely not the Tasmanian farmer. If the Tasmanian producer says he cannot com- pete with the South Australian producer then the Tasmanian farmer admits himself a hopeless failure at the game, and ought to go rabbit catching. But this is where die advantage comes in: The abolition of Customs necessarily drives the Government to land values for revenue. Taxation of land values means free land for the farmers. It also means loosening the death-grip of the mortgagee. These points are kept carefully in the background by the protectionist taradiddler, but the farmers are not taking any Telegraph medicine just now.
