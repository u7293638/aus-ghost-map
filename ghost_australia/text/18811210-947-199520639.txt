Reid, the member for East Sydney, moved the adjournment of the House , for the purpose of diverting attention to the claims for compensation preferred in connexion with the land resumed by the Government at Darling Harbour. He considered some of the claims exorbitant, especially the demand of Mr John Lucas, M.L.C., for £76,945, for tho leasehold of a property only la lr in extent, the freeholder of which also claimed £55,000, and a lessee under Mr Lucas £10,000, makinp; a total of £141,000 for a piece of barren land. He also took objec tion to. Mr T. Garrott's claim for £20,000. The Government would resume in all from various persons an area of 12 acres, at a cost of £60,000 : per acre. He contended that the land should be resumed under the Railway Act. The public interosts would suffer in consequence of, the blunder of the Government unless the resump-f tion were deolored illegal. '. . . : Mr John Lackey, the Minister -, of Publio Works replied that the land was resumed ,uuder the proper not, and in accordance with the terms of the vote for the establishment of wharfs at Darling Harbour. He admitted that the terms. were extravagant, but hoped that they would be reduced in tho Supreme Court, and that the Government would . eventually obtain for from £250,000 to £300,000, ia valuable! property which would place New South Wales in as good a position as any other city in the; colonies for the shipment of wool and other pro duce. ? ??
