' :c PORT:E OLIO. -4-~- "There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse." According to the Jewish commentators, the rod and the "floweri.onld both relate to the sceptre of of His Royal Dominion, and the flower the loveliness of His beauty. The Spirit of the Lord then, shall rest upon this .lower-this flower which shall come forth from the stem and roots of Jesse, by means of the Virgin Mary. And truly the Spirit of the Lord did rest upon our Redeemer. It is written that "in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." The Spirit was not shed upon Him by measure, as it is upon the saints. To Him we may apply the words of the Hebrew Gospel used by the Nazarene, "The whole fountain of the Holy Ghost shall be poured forth upon Him." The Lord is a Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Power is given unto Him in Heaven and in earth, that He, who of everlasting had been King of Heaven, might have a monarchy upon earth also through the faith of them which believe on him.-St. Jerome.
