UNSECTARIANISM AND HISTORIC CHRIS- TIANITY. Unsectarianism, that is the new cult of the day. When intelligent Non- conformists de- sire a true basis for unsectarianism they will seek it somewhat in this wise :-" We have a Bible " (they will 6ay) " but we want to satisfy ourselves that we belong1 to the body of Christians which produced, compiled, cherished, guarded the Bible. For this pur- pose we must trace that body, and their des- cendants through history, and we shall attach ourselves to those Christians of our day who i can produce undeniable proofs that they are continuous in history from the Apostles | times, identical in religious practice with tbe primitive Church, consistently holding the beliefs (at least in clear outline such as in the three creeds) of all ages. God's truth is eternal ; it is not this to-day and to-morrow that, though we do not look for it to be un- touched in aspect by the changing times. In a word, it is the historical Church we require, the Church of the Apostles, thc Catholic Church. And by this we shall know it, that it shall be full of the Holy Ghost, striving with evil continually." This is the tendency of all thoughtful, pious Nonconformists ; and one day they will learn that all they seek is to be found in the Church of England. Another section of Nonconformists who plead for unsectarianism are pure Rationalists, who, as the gentle Izaak once remarked, "go question-begging of the Christian' religion." Family Uhurchman.
