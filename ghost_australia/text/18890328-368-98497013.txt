Another Ghost Gone. THE shbdowisto are losing their bogies or ghosts one by one. A most serviceable ghost has just disappeared at the appearance of the returns of trade between freetrade New South WVales ond proteotionist America. Last year we imported from the States goods to the olnuo of £9t07,528, but owe exported to the States goods to the value of £1,044,144. It is to be hoped the Protection Union of Sydney'will imn mediately point out to the United States people how under protection their money is going out of the country.
