Nurses in Time of War. Speaking of volunteer nurses in time of war, a soldier says : 'Some of the nurses are wise, and some foolish ; some few careless ; most over anxious that their patients should eat, should rouse themselves when lethargic, and sleep when inclined to look about and talk ; and all are of opinion that the patient should be con stantly bathed with water or scent. ''Poor fellow I ' one lady was heard to say, while tears of compassion stood in her eyes. ' Poor fellow, you are suffering so much t it will relieve you if I wash your face.' ' The voune- fellow said nothinir until his nurse had sponged his face, and then he turned to the wall with a groan, and muttered : '' That's the ninth lady as has washed my face to-day.' ' Would-be Tenant : ' I like the house very much, but I hear that it is haunted.' Landlord (rubbing his hands and smiling) : ' My dear madam, I attend to that personally. The ghosts only appear to tenants who do not pay their rent and refuse to move out.'
