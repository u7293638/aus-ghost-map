Latter Day Drouiios. The Danish banker Oarlsben has just died at Copenhagen under curious circumstances. Up to last summer the banker was known to society and the financial world as a serious, intelligent man. One fine day he was told that he bore a striking resemblance to the Czar Alexander III. He laughed very much at first at this, but at last he began to think BO himself after serious affirmations of several persons who knew the Emperor very well, and he could no longer doubt the fact, as his features really strongly resembled that monarch s. His manners seemed to change completely, he had his beard cut the same shape as the Ozar's, he adopted the same pensive way of holding his head, and other attitudes. When the Czar went to Copenhagen, Oarlsben tried his utmost to be pre! sented to him, and Alexander III himself was much astonished with the perfect likeness he had with the Danish banker This Imperial affirmation crowned him w,th happiness, and from Â£at day his reason seemed to give way He drove about Copenhagen in a carriage and four. Often the passersby took him for the Czar, and^owed to him. He, delighted, returned the salutations right and left, and threw the people handful* of money Alas! renown brings care. As he had taken upon himself 80 to say, anther persons skin, he was cruelly afflicted he imagined the Nihilists wished to Ml him, and he became perfectly mad He was taken to a mad asylom, where however, he soon gave up the ghost
