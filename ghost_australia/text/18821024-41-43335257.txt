THE COMET. A few days ago a correspondent signing himself "Observer" wrote to us as follows :— "Before the comet disappears, it would increase my interest in our illustrious visitor to have the following questions answered, if the elements have been obtained to do so :— "a. What is the weight of the comet ? "b. What is the specific gravity ? "c. What was the maximum velocity at perihelion? "d. What has been the length of tail? "e. What angle does the plane of the comet's orbit form with the plane of the Earth's orbit? "f What distance was the comet from the Earth when passing through the plane of the Earth's orbit before and after perihelion ?" We referred his letter to Mr. C. Todd, C.M.G., who has kindly supplied us with the following information -. — 'a and b. We possess no data for answering either of these questions. All observations of comets— even the largest— go to show that their mass is iuliniteuuially small. The satellites of Jupiter exhibited no signs of disturbed orbit3 when Lexell's Comet twice passed through their midst, although its own orbit on each occasion was- altogether altered. Nor was the earth sensibly disturbed when the same comet came within 1,500,030 miles of its surface. The present coniet is probably no exception to the rule, aud although when first seen its nucleus was large, apparently globular, and solid, or planetary looking, both before and after the perihelion, it has , siuce altered its form, and is now reduced ; to a thin streak of light set in its surrounding coma, giving one the idea of an emission ot ;the matter forming the nucleus in two streams into the tail, which hivs crown in i.'ength from about 5' to 20', and is now over ! 100,000,000 miles long . 1 'c. lhe perihelion passage occuned late ;on the night of September 17, or early in the j morning of the ISth, the distance from the isiin being less than any previously known ! comet, or about 453,000 miles, that is, 'within about 23,000 miles of the sun's surface. It must, therefore, have rushed 'through the coronal or gaseous matter sur 'rouiidmg the sun with a velocity approach ing 1,000,000 miles an hour, or half round the sun in less than two hours. . | '? d. The length of the tail has varied from 'about eight or tea millions to over 100,C00,C0u, and to this must be added the faint long extended envelope in front of the head towards the sun, which developed iteelf in a most remarkable manner between the 3rd and the 7th inst. The first time I noticed the formation of this outer envelope ?was on tue morning of the 3rd, when the nucleus was reduced to a long brignt streaK, 'the coma and taii being very bright, and the f latter very sharply defined and bright on its southern edge and cirrous or feathery on the . north edge. Surrounding the head, and for some distance to the rear a^d along the taiL was a fainter envelope forming a margin of considerable breadth. This during the fol lowiiig forty-eight hours extended to at least 3' from the head, with a pointed termination. ' e. The inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic is about 3S\ .: ? . '/? At its ascending node it must have been between 01,000,000 and 92,000,0'JO miles from the earth. The longitude of the ascend ing node is about 353° 3o', the whole of the orbit, excepting where at perihelion it passes round the sun nearly grazing its Bur tace, is south of the ecliptic ; and as : the heliocentric longitude of the earth at the perihelian passage of the coniet was about 3; 5°, the comet must have passed nearly between us and the sun. . ? ? W bile writing about this comet it may be interesting, to compare its orbit, which, by ihe-by, is only a first rough approximation kindly supplied by Mr. cilery with the celebrated comets 0M668, 1843, and 1SS0.

Laujzier and Mauvais assigned a period 01 between tlurty-nve ana thirty-six years to the comet of 1843, but Hubbard made it 530 yearb, and the comet of 1880 has probably a period of thirty-six or thirty-seven years. It will be seen tiiat these four comets have nearly identical orbits, and that all at their perihelion have rushed into dangerous proximitv to the sun — through, in -fact, its coronal flames. That they must have suf fered violence for their temerity seems cer tain, and the question arises — Are tUey one and the same comet, or fragments oi the same body ? If the present comet is identical with that of 1880, it may, as Mr. Tebbutt sug gests, return to us again in a short space, and may perhaps fall into the sun next time. This, however, need cause no apprehension. Ifthe comet of 1S80 was identical with that of 1843, it had been reduced to a ghost of its former size. In its physical aspects the pre sent comet far more resembles 1843. Has tha latter suffered a fate similar to tlut of iieila, and been split into two fragments, the comets of 18S0 and 1882 being the components 1 ' Examining the nucleus with a spectro scope fixed on to the equatorial, I find it has a somewhat complex spectrum. The three carbon lines come out bright and Btrong, Each band is a bundle of lines, especially the middle one, the central portion of each being brightest.
