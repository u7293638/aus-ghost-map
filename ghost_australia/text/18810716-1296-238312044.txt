THE QUEEN'S THEATRE. i ins tneaire wns crownca in nil parts last evening, to witness tbe representation of Hauilet by Mr. De- fries, n well-known Sydney native, and an amateur actor of no mean ability. Mr. Dcfrics lias on pre- vious occasions plsyeil the patt in both Sydney and Melbourne, and hns been most highly spoken of by the press and the public. His performance of last evening was u clever and intelligent one. Avoiding nil inclination to rant, he gave a most appreciative reading of tlie tixt; did not attempt, ns most amateurs do, to over-sot in the more dramntio situations of the play nnd was throughout ulnar nnd careful in his elocution, and easy in liis gestures, Ho was warmly welcomed on first appearing on the boards, and carried the audience with him throughout, rceolviug n cull after every net, and repented roundB of applause during the progress of the play. Miss Marian Willis was graceful and palhetic as Ophelia, and Miss Melville acceptable ns tho Queen. Mr. Steele, as the Ghost, and Mr. Stonehum ns Laertes, were both thoroughly in their element, and Mr. liny- garth made an excellent Polonius. Mr, Barry, ns the King, wns Bomewliat overweighted, while Mr. Barton mado a much better Horatio than, might have been expected. Tho other parts wore fairly sustained. The performance wns not over till very late. To-night, Boueioault's ploy of "Led Astray' will be produced,
