CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES. The boisterous weather which prevailed on Saturday and yesterday mornings rendered train ing operations at Caulfield very unpleasant, and consequently the preponderance of the work per formed was of an uninteresting character. On Saturday the hurdle and flat racer, Yately, who is engaged iu tho Caulfield Cap, was indulged in a moderately fast gallop, oxtending over a mile and a half, and acquitted himself in a very satis factory manner. This horse is in fine condition, and takes kindly to bis exercise. Cupola, a Mol hourne Cup candidate, who is also looking well, was treated to slow serviceable work as nas also Sir Samuel. David, an aspirant for Derby honors, performed & few useful rounds at a steady pace, winding up with a short spirL. The following other animals wero glvon modorato excrciso under tho supervision of their respective trainers Melodious, First Pop, Violet, Mid night. Novelette, Friendless, Veritas, Scara- xnoucho, Ontario, Deceiver, Canute, Tho Ghost, Norfolk, Tumnlt. Altogether, tho proceedings on tbe training ground here are at present un interesting, This is owing to tho very, small number of Derby and Cup candidates that are .located in tho vicinity of the course. During tbis week, howover, it is expected that, through the arrival of additional animals ongagol in tho Spring meetings, the ranks will be greatly swelled, and more intefosting work accomplished.
