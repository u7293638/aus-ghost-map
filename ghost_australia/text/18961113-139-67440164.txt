Burglars that make no moise or marks and leave one's house shut up as tight as a drum tend to shatter a-mairis'nefes.,' "I 'ienet at'once into the country and neighborhood Where Denzil lived, pre tending to look for a bit of land where I could btiild'ititin easy reach of the city. T'put up at a little roadside tavern much trequented 'in the evehing by farm hands. I was'soon Interested in their gossptpibout-a ghost rthich they declar ed-l ad been-seen at'different times and by different peolble. Their awed tones and scared faces fitted the subject, and there -seemed -.to' be- some ' substantial foundation for the uncanny story. One hnusy young fellow who did not look as tbough lhewould 'be easily frightened told o'hils encounter: ""' war a gittin' home kinder late of a Sunday 'light, ai' "List as I kim to th' wcoos ayorid ble Denzil's, I mighty near iad a-ceiilssion with th' ghos'. It warn't no whrte cow er gray hoss er sheep er. rnithin' else'as- war'flesh aan' blood. It whlzzed'by me jist like it war flyin' low an' orful svif' on a broomstick. A feller's got ter blieve his own eyes.,hain't he? I war neversirberer in my life an' never so skeered. T'Ibet my footprints war twenty feet apart 'th' res' of the way home, fur'I had -a' idee that thar pesky thing war a -sailin' 'long jist ahind my coat ttiri.' "I head' like -epetiences from several others, -arid in-some way connected the 'ghost' with the Denzil robberies. For two nights I stodd a dreary watch in the woods "r4ferre'd to without making any discovery. The third night I received a shock. It was intensely dark in the shadows Of the trees, and as I sat at the root Of a'big oak some white object glided-swiftly and noiselessly just above the centre of the road. It made the cold chill run over me, though I have no pa tience "withth ose-who- tell of visits or communications with the departed. "I -was deternmined to enlighten myself and secured a good saddle horse as com Danion of my vigils. ' The second night the "'ghost' flew-by'arid I galloped in Its wake -at all 'the speed my horse could command. A mile ahead the 'appari tion' swerved 'to the- right of the road and ended our mad-race. Tying my horse in a fence corner I crept nearer. Slowly I made out that the 'ghost' was a woman Of stately proportions wearing nothing 'but daintly,rudfled night robe. She-leanud-for,a brief time over the hol low 'stump'thi t lhadl been her evident destination :aid' then turning mounted her flying mia'chine, which was a modern bicycle, antt:wehti scorching biack :ove the course-- she had come..'Again I followed and drd not-stop until I saw. her disappear in the?fde door of the'Denzil house. H'Hasteningl-back to the hollow stump I explored the'Interior." "Arid found the- stolen: property, of course," :interrupted a' listener. "Not .aislgn of it. - I could discover nothing that did not naturally belong there. Failing :to- find the- thief in the 'ghost.' I became-a member of the Den zil hoursehold, ostensibly- as his private secreLtary .: - first discovery was that the 'ghost' was the beaiutiful Miss Den zA. -She'was.a:somnambulist, and in utter ignorance of-the weird night rides she ha?ltaken. But.when:told of themthe explanation'was an easy one. T~hen she and-her-young 'lover were children, that hollow, stump had been. the post office where their ardent missives were mailed acid called for. The memory of those days was-a.delightful one to -her and the .straige mientor of .her uncon scious actioli-prompted her visits to the old spot "My next'impostant discovery explain ed the mystery I was employed to solve. W?atching secretly in the hallways; I saw old Denzil,-With eyes wide open and set, come out-of his chamber, climb the stairs to the attic, unlock an old desk stored there, open a secret drawer and deposit money as. well as jewels. "His action-showed me -that his daughter's habit of moving about at night was an inherited one.. The -next morning he gave me a terrific blowing up as a care less,- incompetent and -worthless detec tive who could -not catch a thief when in the house witl.'him.- I was more in terested in that charming daughter of his than in my -case, and - a scheme flashed into my mind as if inspired. " 'Mr Denzl,' I sald, 'ean you stand the shock of knowing that your daiugh ter is seriously threatened :with:the loss of her mlud because of brooding over separation from the man whom you say she shall never marry~ and that'because of her mental inflrmity -she is :innocently robbbing you under a delusion that in no other way can she provide for the fu ture hsappines of herself;and that young chap. she honestly tihnks, poor girl,-she is going to marry?' ' 'It's a lie,' he.roared, .' a miserable plot. You're discharged.' -'"did:not take Miss Denzil into my -?lans. I seeretty transferred all the stolen wealth to the old stump, "had a trusted officer on guard and then told the old gentleman that I could prove all E had said and insisted on the right to ;vindicate myself. He and I watched at the primitive post-office till Iis daughter carone, and repeated the conduct I have described. Then we brought oun tile con ceased treasures; Denzll was beside himself for fear he might act too late. He shit post haste for thie young lover,. made a handsome settlement, insisted on an bnmediate wedding and had me as one of te guests.
