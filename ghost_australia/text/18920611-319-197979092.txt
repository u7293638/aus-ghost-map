SELECT POETRY- a GOLDEN HOUR. A beckoning spirit of gliulnoss seemed afloat, That lightly danced in laughing air before us ; iha sartli ae ftllln tune, una you a nots of Nature's hnppy chorus. Tros like a vernal morn, yet overhead - : Tlio leafless boughsacross the lane woroknlttlng ; Tho ghost of some forgotten f-prlng, wo said, O'er Winter's world comes flitting. ' Or .wra it Spring herself that, gone astray, - , N; i ' , jjoyond the alien frontier chose to"' tarry ? '. Or but some bold outrider of the May, ' Somo April emissary ? The apparition faded on the air, Csprlcions and incalculable comer- Wilt thou, too, pass, anil Iotvo my chill days bare, And fall'n my phantom Summer 1 â€” Wi'lmam Watson, London Spectator.
