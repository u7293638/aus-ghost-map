POETRY. APART. I thought that o'ur old life was over and done , with, And over npnrt we would wander alone j That Clotlio had brollori tho distaff sho spun with, . Weaving tho woird nob that made my life one with Your own. Yea, but this letter unbidden appeareth, A sorrowful ghost of the sweetness of yoro. Bringing dear thoughts which tho lonely heart cheeroth Recalling tho words which tho heavy soul heareth No more. Ali, but love's blossom oan ne'er bloom again, love, Withered and brown it lies doad in my heart, Thoro let it faded and broken remain, love, Wo must live over while years wax and wane, love, Apart,
