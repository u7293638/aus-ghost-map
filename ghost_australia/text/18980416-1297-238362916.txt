AHE THERE GHOSTS? Since It is not only possihle that porsonB can return from another world, but that there aro woli-authenticated accounts of persons who have dono so, must xve, then, believe all the current stories about spirits or ghosts? By no means, for thore Is not ono of them oiit of a thousand WOl'tliy or tne least creuencu, ui rauiii stand the test of examination. They all, in almost every case, can he explained in a natural way, even those of the reality of which thero appears to ho little doubt.

When the Puritans, of whom gloom and melancholy wero the charac teristic qualities, became the dominant power In England in 1619, wo read that thore was a wide-spread fear of ghosts never known before In tlio land. Remorse of conscience, for great and unnatural crimes, will, too. bring uj> un real spectres threatening punishment or ven geance.

Nor is it necessary that there should be many ghosts, slsuce we have "Moses and the prophets" to direct nnd warn us, nnd do not need the Hpirlt of a Lazarus to como from, tho "bosom of Abraham" to do so. If, however, a genuine ghost shouldi appear to any of us, which, after all, 1s possible, to ask, perhaps, tlio assistance of our prayers, or other wise to warn ns, we need not feel tho least alarm, particularly so if our consctenco be at peace with God, for no ghost, no spirit, no apparition; not even a . fancy, can' do .us any harm or injury 'uuloss by God's, permission-.— J'Catholltj'Royiewi" . -e —
