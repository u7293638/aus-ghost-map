VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUR. Tho May meeting of tho Victoria Amateur Turf Club was held, at Caulfield on Saturday, under favorable circumstances and in tho pre sence of a numerous body of spectators. The weather, which had been threatening during the morning, cleared up, and the aftoruoon was fine, though at times tbeuir.was a little chilly. a.9 mutu >bu vuuiuoiu, mo uiuu o uianageinenc left nothinc to be desired, and but for tho bungling of tho railway. . department tho arrangements in connection with tho moot ing would havo been" complete. Duf- ierin and The Lovito wero in equal demand foi'thc Trial Handicap, and tho former flattered his supporters by occupying a promi nent front position until tho distance post had been passed when, without the Bemblanco of an oifort. Honor n, who, though treated with tho handicappor's customary consideration was un backed, camo through and romped homo a winner by throe lengths, which, had Rammago chosen, might probably have been mado a do::ou or moro. Vascosa and William Toll ran well throughout, but Tho Levito was never prominent. Whalebone again showed that over tho hurdles he is noarer tho first flight than many have supposed, and upset tho Saio running by winning very easily from Roy and Huntsman, beating a remarkably good field. 'The lop weight Goodwood was not mentionod in tho betting quotations, nndthoro- foro, his inferior display, although in marked contrast to previous form, waa probably no dis appointment to anybody, Stafford's viotory over Success and Tho Ghost in the Selling Race was duo in no small measure to a finished picco of riding on the part of young Fiddos through which tho odds laid on Mr. Maitland's gelding wero clovorly landed by a neck. Favo, who once won a Sydney Cup, started in this race and ran a bad last. Tho olub had a nice little wind fall through Stafford's viotory, securing tho whole of tbe £150 for whioh ho was sold t-o Mr. T. Jones. Lady Ashton was the only absentee from the Stcopleohsso, which Mr. Pearson's second string Royal Oak won by a length, after a capital contost with Ruby, Promotion, and nine others. Atlas, who on his first, appoaruaoo at tho last Caulfield meeting, woll jumped vory badly, Btnkin,- 1,L , Sl> repeatedly, and disappointing a etrom- i TCei backora whoso spirited support had i f 01 a pronounced favorite. The orratm la," ln> was in great demand for the Q .„g!','i,51er Handicap, but Monotti, who, in comm, '"J Achmet, mado all tho running, stavil ? illlh the end, and, despite a brilliant effort ? part of Meteor (whoso finish justified y liamo), won by half n ho ill i's favor! to being beaten only a head for'a. . place. The once fainouB hurdle racer I S1 who has been at tho stud for some soasm. ' in thiB raco, but tho veteran's remrmraA was attended by a peouliar mishap, for Ta passing tho winn.ng post last but one hs fell „5 turned a complete somersault.
