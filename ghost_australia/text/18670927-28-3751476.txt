THE PROGRESS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The report of the Government Statist for the year 1866 has just been issued from the Print- ing-Office. It contains much valuable information, though many of the returns to which it relates have already been laid before Parliament, and dealt with in a separate form. Commencing with population, the report shows that on the 25th March, 1866, the colony contained 163,452 persons, of whom 85,33 i were males, and 78,118 females. From that date to the close of the year, the increase of population by the excess of immigration over emigration (by sea) was 2,335 persons, and the addition by excess of births over deaths during the same period was 3,366 souls, making a total population on 31st December last of 169,153 persons-88,272 males and 80,881 females. The total increase since the census, a period of nine months, was therefore 5,701 persons 2,938 males and 2,763 females. In forming a comparison with the preceding year, the addition to the population during the whole twelve months must be taken, and this amounted to 6,849 persons 3,434 males and 3,415 females, the natural increase having been 4,029 persons -1.933 males and 2,096 females, and the bal- lance of arrivals over departures by sea, 2,820 persons 1,501 males and 1,319 females. The increase in population from all sources during 1866 was therefore less by 2,415 persons than in 1865, when the rate of increase was 65- per cent., whilst the rate during the past year was slightly under 44 per cent. In 1864 the increase amounted to 5 per cent., and in 1863 to 3f. The augmentation was, therefore, below the average of the three preceding years, namely, 5 per cent. During the same year (1866 the total addition to the population from the excess of immigration over emigration by sea amounted to 2,820 persons, of whom 1,501 were males and 1,319 were females. From this source, in 1865, our number was augmented by 4,766 persons, 2,649 males and 2,117 females, being a greater number than had been recorded during either of the preceding ten years four- teen immigrant vessels having arrived, landing 4,625 souls. The decrease in 1866, as compared with the previous year, is therefore considerable, amounting to 1,946 persons, 1,148 males and 198 females. It is shown that only ten immigrant ships arrived during the course of twelve months, bringing 3,891 persons, or 734 less than it 1865 ; but there was contemporaneously an increased emigration, amount- ing altogether to 4,135 persons, or 432, more than in the previous year Observer. I PRINCE, ALFRED'S SWEETHEART. The correspondent of the Cologne Gazette, who has chronicled the bashfulness of the Duke of Edinburgh towards the fair sex, was probably in ignorance of the fact, which is by no means generally known here, as to the engagement of His Royal Highness's affections. Some two or three years ago His Royal Highness had an opportunity of making an acquaintance with one of his second cousins, a daughter of the King of Hanover, and conceived a strong attachment to the Princess, who is as captivating in manner and disposition as in appearance. The pretensions of the young Prince were by no means discouraged by his Hanoverian Majesty, who gave his youthful relative (at that time pursuing his studies at Bonn) a general invitation to come at will to Herrenhausen. But this romance of courtship was brought to an untimely and unsatisfactory conclusion by the opposition of an irresistible authority, who could not be brought to look with favor on a matrimonial alliance between the two branches of the family, and the Prince is consequently at liberty to devote himself heart and soul to to the career which he has chosen. Echoes from the Clubs. " I'll Follow Thee !" is the designation of a cartoon in a late number of the ' Tomahawk." It represents the Prince of Wales, as Hamlet, struggling with John Bull, who, as Horatio, is holding him back from pursuing the ghost of George IV., to whom the prince is saying, "I'll follow thee !" " The inference is obvious, and the publication of such a picture is surely a sign of the time and the ' Tomahawk- ' (says the Flaneur in the ' Star ') is by no means ' a low Radical paper. It is another sign of the times, which will probably have been noticed by those whose inclination or whose duty prompts their attendance at public dinners, that while the toast of the Prince of Wales, once so provocative of enthusiasm, is now received with comparative coldness, the mention of the name of the Princess calls forth unmistakable demonstrations of sympathy and personal attachment. Qui vive verra."
