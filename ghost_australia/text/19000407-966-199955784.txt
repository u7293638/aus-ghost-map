THE MEN WHO DIED. Gentlemen, stand for a silent toast, To be drunk wi111 drooping head*. The men who died al a falling post, Who won the least, and who. gave the most— To our • brave, defeated dead. Ghosts of the slain, call out to-night From the graves across the sea. •'Soldiers slain in a losing fight— A wild attack on a mountain height, Or a hopeless charge—arc we. ' Soldiers crossing a ford in flood, Or led 10 a false attack; Dragging our guns through seas of mud, Dark'ning the earth with our hearts' best blood, As we fought our passage back. ' Soldiers marched through the sunburnt day, Marched through the cold, chill night, Walking asleep; in the morning grey In front of the trenches brought to bay, With an unseen foe to fight. * Soldiers—pawns of the gen'ral's game, Yet with lives to lose or live— Done to death on a field of shame; • \\\~c gave our lives for our country's name— AVe had nothing more to give." Gentlemen, drink with uplifted head, proud though the worst is faced; Gentlemen, here's to our honoured dead, The men who fought, and the men who bled—• Defeated, but not disgraced! "TcfcDay." 1
