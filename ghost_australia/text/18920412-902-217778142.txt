Hott it Is Non-Catholics go to Heaven. Cardinal Manning, in the Review of Churches, explains, for the satisfaction of the reunionists of Christendom, how it is that the Catholic Ciiurch admits that non-Catholics can be saved. It is owing to " the Catholic doctrine of the un iversality of grace. They presuppose the doctrine of tbo visible church, which has not only a vis ible body, but also an invisible soul. The soul of the Church is as old as Abel, and as wide as the race of mankind. It embraces every sonl of man who has lived, or, at least, who has died in union with God by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. Nearly 30 years ago I published all this in answer to my friend, the late Mr. Pusey. in a letter on 'The Workings of the Spirit in the Church of England.' This letter has been lately re printed by Messrs. Burns and Coates. Thus far, then, 1 can lay a basis on which to write and to hope with all your contributors. We be lieve that the Holy Ghost breathes throughout the world, and gathers into union with God, and to eternal life, all those who faithfully co-oper ate with His light and grace. None are respon sible for dying inculpably out of the visible Body of the 'Church, They only are culpable who knowingly and wilfully reject its diviue voice when sufficiently known to them."
