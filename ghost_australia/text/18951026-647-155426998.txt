REVIVAL NEWS. The Beeet Circuit has been visited by a gracious revival, greatly blessjjng- ?',' the members and adding largely to our Church membership. Expectancy was high, as there had been much prayer.. Ifc was not surprising therefore to 6hd. the opening services on the Sabbath, well attended, and neither was ifc snr- ; pming to find Bome opposition dis played. For these things, we , were grateful, as they saved our printing: and advertised the meetings. ..Night after night penitents sought pardon, tilL nearly 70 adults had knelt at the peni tent lorm. Many of the converts have already commenced to testify and pray in public, while others by a changed life and altered spirit have given their own evidence. On the last night the converts and members were invited' to; tea, after which some helpful advice was given, the rules of membership- - were read, arid the names of those wil ling to join the Church were taken.. Nearly all present expressed a desire to enter into Church membership.. The Sacramenfc was then administered to allr. . and the office bearers and minister wel comed the converts as members on trial.. In response to an invitation eightyoung; men volunteered, co form a mission: band to conduct aervices in the country' placeB. One pleasing feature of ' the miasion has been the number of young; j men converted, the majority 6f the converfcB being men. Throughout the- ?'; mission invaluable service was rendered. , by Mr. G. H. Martin, of^PoterBham^.,,' and Mr. J. Brew, of the Central Mis sion. And while we thank these brethren,; to God the Holy Ghost we publicly give the honour and ascribe the praise. , ;, ?
