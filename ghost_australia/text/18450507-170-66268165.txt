Then brother something has happened : do not conceal it from me.' There whs n pause ; and then tbe elder born, looking Gledfastly at his hrolher, said, ' Mary is dead : I saw ber last night!' 'Our sister?' 'Yes.' In vain did tho younger brother reason with the elder upon. ihe folly of giving way to such delusions. The solemn reply was, ' I saw her, and spoke with ber at balf-pngl 12 1 Bet night.' Finding all remonstrance vain lbe younger brother noted tbe time, not with any belief in the fatal announcement, but for the purpose of hereafter convincing bis brother of tbe absunfity of yieidingto such melancholy, impressions. The business which led the- elder brother abroad having been transacted, he re turned to England ; and when the *hip Hist brougty.kmh&»wto*M, anchor, bis father!* i'toa.t;. in mwh » was an old servantof tbe family, csjbe alongside; -be was in mourning.
