Kensington v. Bowden Ttro. The Kensington eleven played fifteen of the Eowden Tyro club on the ground of the latter on Saturday afternoon, September 27. The Kensingtons were the first at the wickets and maintained that position for nearly the whole of the afternoon. Stow went in for vigorous hitting and put together 63 runs before he was disposed of, although he had oue or two lives given him by the out- field. Edwards played a capital game and placed 35 runs to his credit by sterling cricket without having given the ghost of a chance. The innings closed for a total of 142 runs, Hughes being not out for 9, and Caterer having scored a similar number. For the Tyros Barry secured the best bowling average, namely, three wickets for 23 runs. Shortly after 5 o'clock the Tyros took the wickets to the bowling of Lucas and Rigaud, and when the stumps were drawn they had nine wickets down for 36 runs, of which 24 only were made from tho bat, as there were no less than twelve byes registered. B. Gould was the highest scorer with 10. The bowling, consider ing the state of the out-field, was moat conr mendable. Rigaud's average of five wickets for 6 runs speaks for itself.
