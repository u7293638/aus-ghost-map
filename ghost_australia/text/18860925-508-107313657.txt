THE Mystery of Poker Bock. Br Miss Raleigh. Chapter XXXVIli. — The Luckt Goes Down. Meanwhile, -Mother Land sat moaning over the kitchen fire. ' The major's dead, and Asa's lost, and now the light is going out.' This seemed to her the crowning woe. For over fifty years — years in and years out night after night, from sunset to sunrise ? — the Faulkland Island light had burned up I steady and true. Never wavering nor faint, ? it had stood up like a brave soldier through ? storm and tempest - — summer's heat and I winter's cold — cheering with its friendly ray, ? the bestormed and benighted mariner on the ? Sound. If it had faltered at any time, the ? major would have considered himself for ? ever disgraced. His chief pride was to ex ? hi bit his lighthouse to the Government ? Inspectors tidy and trim, and his lamps ? clean and bright as stars. Asa had been as ? scrupulous as his father. He would have lost his life rather than have his light go out; but both were gone, and now the light was going too. ' Lord help me,' moaned Mother Land ; * everybody's dead-^-everybody's dead !' But no, not quite, it would seem from the great, crashing steps that came plunging up through the frozen crust of ice and snow to the very bank driven up against Mother Land's door. A heavy hand strikes tl^c latch — the door is burst open, and a tall, Btrange- looking apparition strides into the room. It looks like a man with his frozen garments rattling at every step lite a coat of mail. A part of his face is hidden by a large handkerchief tied down over his cap, and frozen on. The portion of the face to be seen is purple and swollen, and not like any face that Mother Land ever saw before. There are icicles hanging from his cap and his hair, and Mother Land thinks it is the ghost of soxde drowned man walking into I her room. At all events, he acts strangely I enough for a ghost, or any other monstrous I thing to be dreaded. ? i He does not even 6top to close the door, I but plunges forthwith into the passage-way, I brings outji furnace, which he shovels full of I ted-hot coals and 'brands from the fireplace. ? f his he takes up in bis arm, darts into the ? lower part of the lighthouse, stops there ? long, enough to get an iron kettle that fits ? the furnaces, and a can of oil standing by ? itself, and with his arms fall vanishes up w the stairway to the tower. ? The last lamp is burning a little yet. To B set the furnace on the floor — to put the V kettle on the top of that, to turn the oil ? from the can into the kettle, which from its V fluid state: ipjoves itself to be pure, winter i I strained oil, is the work of a moment. Then I I off 'comes the top of one of the dead lamps, i I he thrusts in his hand, and snatches out I 1 great handsful of oil as thick as lard, and »| flings it no matter where, for the last lamp III is 'only flickering. The cold oil is all out, ml the wick and burner are dipped into the hot Ml oil over the furnace; then thekettle is lifted ~Wk an(^ ^J16 kQt oil turned into the lamp, the j^B top screwed xm, and held over the dying ^B lamp, quick enough to be lighted by its last H flicker. It had struggled hravely, and died S giving life to its successor. ^m Tke newly-filled lamp blazed up brightly ; H the Faulkland Island light had not been out H titter^, for one single instant; though it H might as well, for all practicable purposes, H have been out for the whole past hour. ^| The man turned to treat another lamp in fl| the same way, when he for the first time saw ^m Amber -leaniag against the 'wall. - ?

Leaving floor. As the man opened the door she ' moaned. He went up to. her, * Thank 0od !' fee ejaculated, hearing her moan again. - 'She ought to be laid on my bed; its warm enough for her! .there, now,* said Mother Land. ? ? The matt turned, washed Ibis hands and stripped off his coat, now dripping wet from j the melting ice about him; Then he tenderly lifted Amber, and laid her on Mother Land's bed. : 'Hand me the brandy?' he said. When the girl had swallowed a little, she opened her eyes. She stared at the strange face over h.^r. The eyes, she recognised. 'Asa!' she said. 'Yes.' * Where is father?' This strong man, who had borne himself so heroically the past terrible twenty- four hours, hid his face in the bed clothes, and groaned out . ' Oh, Amber ! I. had rather drowned my self than come back to you without him.' That was all he said, and she asked no questions ; none were needed. * I would like to be alone !' she said at | last. Asa lifted his head and looked atthepoor, pale face pressed into the pillow, as if it would hide from sight. Great tears, which all the danger of the distress of the past day j and night could not force from him, were running unchecked down his cheeks now. * Oh, Amber !' he whispered, * don't die; live for my sake, I beg of you.' She only turned -i-er face closer in the pillow, and moaned wearily. He was not afraid of her now. He stopped and pressed his swollen lips to the pale, up turned cheek once and again. ' Is there anything I can do for you ?' he whispered. There was a pitiful quiver in her voice as she answered : ' Leave me a little while now, please.' With tears still on his. face, Asa took up the candle. ' Gome mother,' he said. 'Is it really you, Asa?' asked Mother Land, when they were in the kitchen, still in doubt — he looked so strangely. ' Yes, mother ; but last night this time I never expected to! be here^again/ Mother Land clasped her hands, and her lips moved noiselessly. Asa knew that she was thanking God for his escape. Presently she started up. ' You must be half starved ; I'll get some thing to eat rig-htoff ; and we'll have a great hot fire in no time/ 'Not for me, mother; I'm in torment from the fire already.' ' .. * What, are your feet frozen ?' . * Yes, and hands too.' 'Well, look here, it's lucky the snow drove up against the door. You get yomv boots off, and I'll fill the big tub with snow, and we'll get your 'feet into it, and the frost will all be out by daylight.' * I must look at my lamps first,' he said. The lamps were burning courageously, and the frost was beginning to melt on the windows inside, though it was colder out doors now. than it had been at any time before. It was abdnt 4 'o'clock now. He made more fire in the furnace and came down, satisfied that the lamps would burn till daylight. ?'.'';.',? He found the tub of 6now and ice wait ing for him; and, with his mother's help, cut off his boots and stockings — there was no getting them off any other way, liis feet were eo swollen— r-and pat his feet- into the frozen mass. His hands were eared for in ? the same way, arid his ejars .anil' 'the side of his face, wiaeh, when -;t!ie cap and handker chief were removed, proved to be frozen likewise^ ? ??? i ' What's become sof Dency ?J ajsked Mother Land, in a whisper, after Asa .had drank off two cups of steaming hot cqffee, 'I slon't know,' answered Asa, gloomily shaking bis .head ? .. ' . . Before the sun rose that morning Asa had told Ms Story. ' ' '_' '? '.-.?'?-. It seemed that they had a rongh passage round to the river, but reached Lyme Ferry about 10 o'clock the day they started. Here they ate their lunch, made an awning of the sail, and waited. About 1 o'clock that night* three men tame down to the boat. One of them was St. Cyr, completely en veloped in a thick woollen suit. TJae other two pat him aboard, gave h|m $, bojbtle of brandy, and told them that ihey must put out jEor the island at once fbr*£fee officers were already on St. Cyar's track. They expected a rough time, but-iconcluded to start. They got on better, than they ex pected till they rounded Saybropk Boiat.

Then they drove straight towards the shore ; but just before they reached it a cross wave struck the Lucky, and she went dewrtr Dency he did not see, but St. Cyr was near him when they went down. Asa struck out for the shore and reached it, which proved to be Saul's point,' stretching out from Glittfrm beach. Here he waited the rest of the night and the next day, hoping to see or hear something from Dency or St. Cyr, in vain. Just before night be took a rowboat and started for home. He had been all night coming from Clinton to Faulkland Island, and had barely escaped perishing bj the way. So it was ended, and Dency and St. Cj^* were undoubtedly lost. Chapter XXXIX.— They See Smoke: On the third day after jfehe storm Asa had so far recovered th€-fusg|o$ his hands and feet that, by having them, carefully done up (wearing boots aia$L j®£%S^s was out of the question) he ventraredjjp take Amber home. By virtue of ox^raElmjsepiidden changes for which a New Sngiana climate is dis agreeably famou%| i£ub Jlrs^ther was now quite mild and pleasant, Asa rigged up a sail for his rowboat, for^^bf course, rowing was not to be l^^^nT df'in his presentcon otion, and ab^^^oi&r; they steirted for Duck Island. Burwefipj^l^ey went Amber, in answer to the many entreaties of both mother and son, at last promised that if neither her father nor Dency were heard from she would some time, sbe could not tell when, come back to Faulkland Island again. They could not urge her more, and bo they let her go. Very little talking was done on the way from Faulkland to Duck Island. They had been in plain sight of the little island for some time, and Amber's eyes had wandered over it from side to side, when suddenly she started, the pale face growing paler. 'Asaj there's smoke coming out of the chimney.' 'Yes.' Not another word was said on either side, and Asa, without waiting to go round to the wharf, hastily ran the boat in between two rocks on the south side, where he sometimes landed when he was in a huiry. To cross the island was the work of only a few moments, even with Asa's lame foot. They pushed open the door, and there on the floor, within reaching distance of the fire, lay a queer looking object, so bundled up that they could not tell whether it was. human or not; but the jar of the closing door made it groan, and Amber went quickly to what she supposed to be the head, and stooping down, exclaimed : ' Why, Dency, is it you ?' * Yes, child, and I'm glad enough to see you back again,' answered a thick voice. ' Are you sick ?' said Amber, tenderly. * No, but I'm all frozed up, and can't stir hand nor foot, and I hain't had a mouthful to eat for three days. It was all I could do to lay here and poke a stick of wood on the fire how and then.' . * I'll get you -some dinner, and we'll make you more comf^^^blte^rjght off,' answered Amber, hurriisdi|6^^-;BiiJ she did not move from her stoopmg^tf&isBtfe;^iand there was a question in herle^Is Inair, her tongue could not ask. ir'f ^rsm cv *I know whai^|g^^but I can't tell you nothing about 'mm. said Dency at last, presently adding, * Who brought you over?' f 'Asa/ ? L .-.=. s, * Yes,' said Asa, coming round where she could see him. ; ?- ?' *Well, I never expected to see you again.' * Nor I you,' answered Asa. *That was the awfulest night I ever jknew.' Amber went out of the room, and Dency whispered to Asa: .-''???: * You don't know anything about him then ?' 'No.' A painful silence ensued. How Dency ever got lo Duck Island no one knew. She never told, and when -she was questioned answered — 'No matter how I got here, so long as I'm here now ; I don't remember much about it, anyway/ That was all, she ever said- they saw that it troubled ker, and forbore to question, her ftfterihat.

He remembered how Hetty came to the door and the welcome she gave him then, and thought of all the changes, and how different it would be if he should apply for admission now. He was growing strangely tired and sleepy, andfwas about to sink down by the wayside and end the miserable farce his life had become, when Amber's pleading face flitted before him. For her sake he must make one more struggle. He forced himself along to the fence and stood holding on. The last of the brandy was gone. He must have warmth from somewhere, or he could not live another hour. His mind wandered ; he fancied himself going over the old house, and taking Hetty out of the chamber window from the back shed, -and, without being exactly conscious of what he did, he crossed the yard and stood in the lee of the house, looking up at the old shed. Suddenly, and like an illumi nation, came the remembrance of the Dark Hole, 'and how warm it used to be there. It was iust the place for him now. No one would ever think of looking for him there. He could warm and recruit himself, and after a day or two get out again in the night, go down to the shore, and cross over to Duck Island, and be at home once more. New strength came to him now; he could see his way through at last. With a painful effort he raised himself to the roof of tire shed, and with his numb hands forced open the window and stepped in, carefully closing it after him, and in a few moments was lying on the floor back of the chimney, in that old iJark Hole. It seemed very pleasant there to him. Warmth and shelter from the storm — he would not have exchanged the place for a kingdom. It was now daylight — he heard them moving about downstairs; but he was not afraid of their disturbing him; and being thoroughly worn out, he fell asleep. Towards night he awoke in terrible agony. It seemed to him that his feet and the lower part of his limbs were enveloped in a bed of burning coals, and were slowly roast ing through. He knew that both hands and feet were frozen, and it was impossible for him to do anything for them then. His . head was not right, but still he remembered where he was — the dread of pursuit and cap ture- never left him day or night. It was possible that some one of the family whom he heard moving about might unexpectedly enter his retreat; he must hide himself more effectually. Moving his hands restlessly about in his agony, he felt that one of the boards near him was loose. It required no great effort and but little noise to force it off, and be neath this was as snug a place as any one could desire. To be sure it seemed a good deal like a coffin, and he shuddered as he drew the board over him to its place. ' Before the next morning he knew that walking down to the beach without help was impossible ; he could not even stand. He must make arrangements to stay where he was for the present. £50 after the family' were all asleep at night he crawled about the house on his hands and knees, got com fortables and bandages for his limbs, and food for his stomach. His previous practice of seeing in the dark, at Newgate, was an advantage now ; but having to go on his hands and knees, of course he could not move as quiet or as fast as he would other wise have done. Going up and down stairs was his greatest difficulty, for his limbs grew worse and worse instead of better, and he moved slower and heavier each night. The thought that possibly some one wou'd see him, made him wrap himself in a sheet, that he might be supposed a ghost. In this condition Charity Grant, the ' hired girl,' saw him on the stairs one night, when she was watching to see who it was that ate up her pies arid cakes and bread. She had sus pected Mathew, but had found a ghost as she believed. She vanished so quickly that StJ Cyr had no;time to see 'who she was ; and a few nights after went to her room, haviner ' a vague idea of throwing himself on her] mercy, and getting her to help him to] escape* for he suffered so in body and mind j that existence in his present state was well j nigh intolerable. But his appearance fjejgh- ., tened her bo that she screamed amdalatjaedJ the house, and search was made for *fee phantom but in vain. St. Cyr wasaawjast losing control of himself, both phygigaOy and mentally.
