SPIRITUALISM. TO THE EDITOB. Sir—Seeing that you take notice of my activity in Spiritualism, which is less intrusive as a new creed than shattering to pieces old and worn-out ones (thereby affecting the "craft"),I beg of you to state to u«y many friends in the Peninsula, that in spite of the aberration of my mind, I am in full swing of intellect to knock down any sceptic, without calling in the ghost of my grandmother, whereas opponents usually deliver their arguments from under the apron of their clerical nurses. Mr. Green has done fine work here by removing the childish notion that all is fraud and trickery, and shifts the responsibility on Satan, certainly a more respectable theory than the conjuriug business, for' it confirms the supernatural source. Whether Mr. Green will extend his persuasive influence beyond his clique, has to be seen, but he has lost much ground already by confessing his scope of practical experience. I may sum up the situation by suggesting that at first people were in a rage, that all was humbug, and now they grumble because it is true. But the discontent starts from the clergy in fear of their "business"—not of danger to their beloved creed. If editors would only betake themselves to inquire at proper quarters about authorities, the temptation of attacking the intelligence and character of the pioneer for progress would reduce the decent silence and cautious talk.—Yours truly, C. REIMERS. [We would respectfully suggest that Herr Reimers obtain the assistance of his grandmother's ghost or some other spirit to unable him to write a letter that ordinary readers can understand or give up scribbling.—E D.]
