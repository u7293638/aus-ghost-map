POETRY. SO LITTLE DONE. So touch to do, so little done ! In sleepless eyes I saw tbe sun ; His beaming disk in darkness lay, Tbe dreadful ghost of Yesterday. So little done, so much to do ! The morning shone on harvest new, In eager light I wrouarht my way, And breathed the spirit of To-day. So muoh to do, so little done ! The toil is past, tbe rest begun ; Though little done and muoh to do, To-morrow tan band heaven are new. â€”J. J. Piatt.
