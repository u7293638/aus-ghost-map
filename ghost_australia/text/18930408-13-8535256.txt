' THE ESCURIAL: PALACE, MONASTERY, AND TOMB. Harper's Magazine contains a posthumous paper by the late Mr. Theodore Child It is a brilliant description of the Escurial, that singular and grandiose monument of the former might and magnificence of the Spanish kings. MF-ANOUOL- i_i_t_\sm The first impression made by the material is its immensity, and the last its melancholy There is no getting away from the place. It nearly fills the little town of Kscunal, for naturally a monument built in the shape of a gridiron to recall the instrument of torture on which St Laurence suffered martyrdom is rather struggling - "The immensity of it takes your breath away. It is not a palace, but a cyclopean town, and although the sun may be shining brilliantly, it looks sad and funereal with its grey walls picked out with storing joints of white mortar, its leaders roofs, its granite paved surroundings, its volcanic aspect This impression of something burned, blasted, plutonium, of something that has passed through raging fire, struck me time after time as I looked upon the structure Nor is this side - of fire inappropriate The palace convent itself is built in the form of a gridiron turned upside down, and that in memory of the patron, San Lorenzo, who was bowled by Valerian on a slow fire, and, according to Prudentius, bore his musty room with coolness and even jocose irony, for when one side was roasted he had himself turned and invited his cooks to try whether he tasted better undertone or well done. 'the surface occupied by the edifice is 39,000 square metres , the exterior of trades measure more than 800 metres, and are pierced by 15 doors and 1,128 windows , in the interior there are 16 court yards, St staircases, 88 fountains, nine towers, and 4,5.3 rooms, in the whole edifice there are more than 10,000 window a and 2,000 doors, while the lobbies, cloisters, and court yards measure in length some 75 miles " ntl GHOST or run IP. Hie Tsctinal is haunted by the ghost of its founder-the grim, gloomy, fanatical Philip II, who married our own Queen Mary, and made of the Inquisition an unexampled engine of tyrannical power He built the vast place as a monument to his father and himself, but, as the old Duke of Braganza said, he who made such a great vow must have had great fear" Mr Child gives us a striking picture of Philip's own quar- ters - "With a chill of mysterious terror you pass through a low door, and find yourself in a simple room, with a tiled floor and b ire whitewashed walls, relieved of their base by the usual blue and white tiles The room is lighted by three small windows glazed with old rough glass, through which may be seen vast landscapes of drink verdure and grand mountain silhouettes, which prove that the morose king was not so ill advised as some writers state, when he chose the site of his cloistered police This is the room where Philip II lived in monastic simplicity, and boasted that from the foot of his mountain he governed the Old World and the New with two inches of paper The carpet of matting interwoven with gold, and with the double headed imperial eagle in red, is now hung up against the wall and the red tiles of the floor are bare Here is the table where Philip used to sit and annotate state papers, here are his portfolio, his inkstand, his set of pigeon holes , here is the smaller table of his secretary, Antonio Perez ; here is amused able armchair studded with brass nails, and with a 1 athel back stitched into checkers On this ch in the King used to sit and on these two stools, with their cushions of greenish brown velvet-the one stool bealing still traces of red lacquer, the other of black wood bound with silver His Majesty rested his ulcerated legs In the alcove to the right the great monarch slept on a bed doubtless as vulgar and even sordid na the chairs and tables of his sittingroom Next to the alcove e Dundalk oratory, with walls of polished and panelled jasper Touch a spring, the panels open and reveal the grand altar of the church and on the opposite side, in gilt bronze, the group of Charles V kneeling in eternal firoyer with the women of his house beside him In this narrow oratory Philip, in 1893, took to his bed suffering tortures, his body devoured by sores, wasting away literally like Job upon his dung heap Through these narrow openings in the jasper panels, with which the irreverent fingers of CURIOUS tourists now play, the monarch, worn out with care and sickness, peered with anxious eyes as the priest celebrated mass amidst the splendour of the capella mayor Here in this narrow, dark, and close corner he died An inscription on the wall records the graphic summary of his end -' In this narrow chamber died Philip II when the world was too small to contain the son of Charles V, He lived so far from the earth that his soul alone vi as being of his body there remained but the shadow when he finished dying ' Titi. MUMMY Of "tHAT CHORUS ' And now for the end of all the might and splendour of the Spanish Hapsburgs the nice who for a brief space held the major part of the world wealth-not, as it turned out, in fee, but on sufferance " We descend into the royal tomb, or Pantheon, for such is the term given by the Catholic Spaniards to a Christian burial place This vault, placed exactly beneath the high altar of the church, is an octagon room 16ft in diameter and 3Â½ft high you descend into it by means of a staircase whose walls are lined with green and yellow polished Missed The walls of the Pantheon are of polished marble, porphyry, and jasper, richly ornamented with gilt bronze capitals, bases, and angels, the whole executed by Italian artists after the death of Philip II As an inscription informs us the founder of the Lscunal built only a simple vault Philip He began the present gorgeous structure in 1.17 ; Philip IV completed it, and moved in the royal bodies on the 17th of Match, 1034, alter Diego de Velasquez find with his own hands fixed in its place the bronze crucifix by Pedro Faces, which he had brought back from Italy The octagon walls contain 20 niches or shelves, on each of which is a grey marble sarcophagus or use of classical shape On the left are the lungs and on the right the mothers of kings, from Charles V down to our own times In lodes Philip IV opened the urn containing the remains of Charles V and after looking awhile at the mummified body he said, laconically, to Luis de Halo, 'Don Luis, crepe homage, to which the Prime Minister replied, ' Si, sector, may horrid Charles II also opened this august sarcophagus, which was again opened by Ferdinand VII after the French invasion, and once more in 1870, when the aspect of the mummy was carefully reproduced by a painter of Madrid, and photographs from this picture now enable curious tourists to carry away with them an authentic portrait of the corpse of the great emperor, whose features inspired so happily the brush of Titian and the chisel of the Leonis " ' Silent, empty, dear, and useless , a prodigious monument from which the soul has departed this is Mr Child's summing up of this wonderful monument SEMSOK ALFREDO LFIIVS, judge of the Court of Appeal at Goa, in the Portuguese Indies, was tried recently on the charge of corruption by the High Court in Lisbon and was sentenced to three years' suspension from his office and to pay a line of 36in milreis After the judgment had been read Senhor Leilas quitted the court, and immediately afterwards blew his brains out
