"Ghost " Upon "Ghost" The theory that an author who has made a reputation can sell anything he pleases, so that his signature is attached to it, is supported by the following story:— Some months ago a Paris newspaper ordered a story of adventure from a well-known novelist. The price agreed on was one franc per line. The novelist straightway hunted up an old man of letters—the unknown "ghost" or collaborator of many more famous authors—who willingly agreed to write the story at the rate of twenty- five cen- times a line. When the work had reached its second part in the course of publication, the novelist learned that his old client was seriously ill. Hastening to his bedside, he found him dying. In agony for the fate of his story, the novelist rushed to the office of the newspaper, got hold of some back numbers in order to pick up the threads of the romance, and brought it to a speedy end in a few brief chapters. Then he went to the office with the manuscript. "What's that?" asked the editor. "Why, the continuation and end of my story." "Oh! then you want to change it, I suppose; because, you know, you sent in the last chapters three days ago." Admirable self-possession on the part of the novelist prevented disaster, and he finally evolv- ed this explanation: The old man whose price was twenty-five centimes a line had himself sublet his task to another "ghost" at ten centimes, and thus the work had been finished in good time!
