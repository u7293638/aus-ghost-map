A GHOST. A weird story of the appearance of a ghost at Brighton reaches the Daily Tele- graph from Mr. Thomas Lucas Smith, who writes as follows from Mansion Hlouse Chambers, E.C.:â€”"On Thursday I was stopping at the house of a friend at Brighton, and having remained up reading for some time after the family had gone to bed, I at last, it being nearly twelve, pre- pared to retire to rest. In going upstairs I seemed to catch a glimpse of a patch of moonlight on a wall by the window on the second landing. As I drew nearer, to my utter astonishment, this gradually took the shape of a woman! The ghostly nature of this form was apparent, for the wall was clearly visible through the figure. The shape was that of a woman about thirty, tall, well-formed, and clothed in some plain garment which might have been a shroud. She was gazing earnestly into the grounds through the window, a very sad expression upon her face. Suddenly she gave a deep sigh of such utter lament that it startled me more than even the first sight of the apparition. Then her form grew indistinct, and in a few seconds vanished. I examined the wall, but found no trace of anything abnormal. In the morning I related the strange adventure to my host, who was remarkably upset at my narrative. At his request I refrain from naming the precise house, as the pro- perty is for sale, and publicity might do it harm. He stated there was a family secret he could not reveal, and contented himself by asking me to inspect a certain picture in his possession. I was astonished to find the ghost and this portrait to exactly tally. The latter must have been at least seventy years old. I await an 'explanation' from these scientists and conjurers who laugh at spiritualism. I know that my experience is real."
