Novelties. There isa general desire with costumieres to describe the colours for the season by the names of flowers— dahlias, pansy, coleus, annemone, scabious, geranium, violet heliotrope, rose, &c..; Considering .into how many shades of various colours the majority of these flowers have now been classified, the original term gives but little informa tion. Dahlias are in several colours of red, yellow, and purple ; pansies include the velvetty blue black, purple, berless. Scabious is equally diverse in tint. Geraniums offer endless changes in colour ; and roses, though often bracketed with red, are white, yellow, pink, and some nearly black. In a general sense the original colour is understood; this to grandmothers may be tolerably clear, bnt even with them the shade would be doubtful. A wall flower brown is recognisable as one of the richest of modem shades. The Colombe breech in antique «Jwr coasufe of two doves perched on a small rsd, with a' ball of dark blue enamel at each end. From this bar hang three silver fieur de lys, the largest in the centre. This is one of the prettiest of new ornaments. A necklet of antique silver, containing 28 round medal* lions, with a flower and a satyr'6 head alternately on flach, is a second. Cleopatra pins are fashionable for the hair; an antique coin forms the head. Jewels are now veiled with tulle, as were the flowers of last season. Gobelin or ghost-gray is one of the new colours, and in velvet is particularly elegant. A muff to match the hat in colour and material will be conspicuous in this winter's toilettes. Some French and English ladies are endeavouring to revive the fashion for powder. Long arrow-shaped brooches are most fashionable with dogcoliars: round ones can only be worn when of especial value. ?
