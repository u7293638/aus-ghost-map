Lochinvar. Preachers who have conduoted service in our little brick church in this picturesque if somewhat ancient village, and your readers everywhere, will be glad to hear that quite a time of refreshing and revival has come. The special services during two weeks, conducted by the Eev. C. Jones, our respected superintendent, have resulted in the conversion of about twenty persons. With the exception of two nights, when help was rendered by Revs. T. Parker and W. Hill, Mr. Jones was at the helm; but the unseen Pilot, God the Holy Ghost and the adorable Saviour, who is the Captain of our salvation, were present to heal, and there were souls willing in the day of His power. Considering that the Methodist population of the place is small, a yield of twenty, among whom are Borne promising young men and maidens, must be regarded as a something to bleBS God for : ' Break forth into singing ye trees of the wood, For Jesus iB bringing lost sinners to God.' Good prayers never come weeping home. â€” Bishop Hall.
