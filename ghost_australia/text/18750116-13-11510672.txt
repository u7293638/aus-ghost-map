THE THEATRICAL WORLD IN LONDON. (FROM AN OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Nov. 26. Plays are plenty just now, and playgoers are numerous, as they always are at this season, when the "great world has not settled down to its task of entertaining and being entertained when the very worst, be cause the earliest, portion of the dreary London winter is exerting its most depress- ing despotism, and driving and riding are impossible for motives of pleasure At this dismal time fashionable London dines early and goes to the play. The Strand is lined on both sides of the way with carriages the horses' heads looking like monstrous living imitations of the gigan the cast from the head of the fatal steed by whose agency was compassed the fall of Troy, as we behold it in the Crystal Palace, and masses of dark vapour filling up the entrances to the theatres, so that the ladies who descend from the car rages are swallowed up in the fog despite Hu glaring gaslight Nevertheless all undaunted, fashionable London goes to the play So does unfashionable London but then is always goes when the theatres are open, and the fact does not affect the question of in season or "out of season,' or the occupation (otherwise than by paper," 01 gratuitous admissions) of the orchestra stalls fashionable London goes chiefly to the Lyceum, where Mr Irving's Hamlet is an attraction of the most potent kind The announcement of a new Hamlet has always been a source of excitement, curiosity, and interest, but in this instance those sentiments have been increased by the length of time which has elapsed since a new candidate for public favour in the character of the Prince of Denmark has presented himself, and by the immense popularity which Mr Irving has attained to in a totally different line of representation He has been described lately as having been four years ago " a good stock actor, rather difficult to fit with a part," and that description is substantially true He has risen to a height of faint and fashion within a very short and, though, his career in this respect was no more bear comparison with that of David Garrick or Edmund Kean than he talent can be fairly submitted to competition with theirs, according to that traditional' standard which is the only on to be applied to an actor, that artist who is truly vox el practices mind No one had thought of Mr Irving as a Shakspearian actor, until it was announced that Hamlet was to be produced at the Lyceum, though a little attention to provincial programmes would have enabled us to learn that he had played the chief character in that tragedy on several occasions Genuine interest, even excitement, were created by the announcement and as the time for the production of the play drew near they assumed exaggerated dimensions One heard of large bets on certain readings which were to be or not to be expected from the new Hamlet, and paragraphs appealed in several papers in which the important question whether Mr Irving would appear in his own hair or a wig was gravely debated. This created just a little reaction , it was put down to the original and well trained talent for advertising of the manager of the Lyceum the enterprising gentleman whom the Home designates "Papa Bateman, and it was universally considered to be in bad taste The slight reaction, however, in its turn gave way to the interest of the occasion, which no puffing could really injure, and on the 31st October such a house assembled for the first night of "Hamlet," as has not been seen since the gathering which, with equal curiosity perhaps, but with much less cordiality, greeted Mr rechter, when, in black velvet attire, and a flaxen wig, with the Danish order of the old plant displayed upon his breast-an reach ronism equal to that of the cannon perpetrated by Shakspeare himself-he accosted the ghost in the accent of the boulevards Many persons were there who remembered the "Hamlet ' of Macready and of Kean, the majority of the spectators had seen rechter It was to be expected that comparisons should enter largely into the general criticism The theatre was crowded from floor to ceiling, and a hat? of recognition, speculation, and rumour ran through the stalls, private boxes and dress circle The pit was crammed to an extent which must have been very distress mg to the members of the crowd, but they bore the crush with great good humour Art, literature, fashion, and the press were all well represented on this occasion, and every body had enough to do in recognising every body else, to render the inevitable delay in the rising of the curtain unimportant People hardly attended to the first scene though the ghost was a good ghost, they settled themselves in their seats, glanced over their programmes, adjusted their glasses, and awaited eagerly the shifting of the scene, which, when it occurred, contrary to the tradition of Macready s time, disclosed not the assembled court, but a prepared presence chamber, vacant, then rapidly filled to the music of trumpets by the retinue of the King and Queen who entered, followed by Hamlet The first impression was very striking The brooding melancholy of the Prince of Denmark, the pale and haggard countenance the scattered black hair, the dress elegant tasteful perfectly appropriate and quite unconventional, the very attitude in which Hamlet dropped into the chair of state beside his mother, averting his gaze from her, and turning a deaf ear to the growing voice of the King, all these fulfilled the expectations of the audience, and a rustle of satisfaction made itself distinctly heard. The originality of Mr. Irving's Hamlet established itself in the general conviction from that moment His face and figure have certain attributes most favourable to the personation , but, again, certain defects of both mar it to some extent Granting that Hamlet was 30-as seems proved by the text, Mr. Irving looks too old, the two months of suffering and disgtistsince his father a death could not have turned the young man in his prime-who, in describing the contrast he now presents, describes his former self into what we see him there The power of facial expression, in which Mr Irving is certainly unsurpassed in this day, is invaluable tells "Hamlet," but the an- gularity of his movements is against him and the thinness of his legs, rendered additionally remarkable by their being clothed in tight black silk hose, met by the furred edge of his black surcoat, gives him at times when his back is turned to the audience an almost grotesque appearance, which is added to by his excessive restlessness The latter is one of the peculiarities of his acting in this part, which seems to me most truly conceived and admirable, both as an evidence of Hamlet's shifting misery and irresolution, and of the feigned madness of which restlessness would be a true characteristic. "He is like a by ena, was one of the numerous remarks which caught my ear, and it was singularly true He walks to and fro, yet with some thing caged and repressed about him too where other Hamlets stand, and he Hits talking to himself, but always with a tired out air supine from utter weariness, when other Hamlets strut and decision. I almost all the famous soliloquies he acquitted him self well, and in the scene with the r'Sjorfl, in which certain critics consider that his acting lacked dignity, I thought it per feet. The combination of the kindliness of a princely patron with the critical taste of a true artist, in Hamlet's hints to the loading actor, the quick sensitiveness conveyed in the rebuke to Polonaise, and the sudden falling back from the involuntarily aroused interest in external things to the ineffectual brooding upon the dark secret in his own soul were all extraordinarily fine On the whole the conclusion of the play scene, when the meeting breaks up " in most admired disorder was the most brilliant and startling success of the performance The wild bar of triumph with which Hamlet witnesses's effect of his device, the exultant frenzy wit which he tosses away Ophelia's fan i peacock's feathers he has previously been playing with it-as he changes the old lie "A very, verypivjock' into "A very, ver peacock,' thus lending it a vivid means and emphasis, and flings himself into a seat just vacated by the king can hard ever, I think, have been excelled on any stage His marvellous burst of emotion, which Mr Irving's figure seemed to dilate and the expression of his face assumed a indescribable intensity, was admirably It up to by his acting during the play seen The adopts the traditional attitude of Hatnle lying at Ophelia's feet, with his head turned away from the players, this attitude I have noYerbcen able to recognise as correct ] must have excited the attention of over; body, and as the play has been special! ordered by Hamlet, and is bailed by the King and Queen as a means of diverting him symptom of his return to a more healthy state of mind it would certainly have provoked comment and remonstrance on the part However, as it is accented, Mr Irvin adopts it, and he certainly gives it extraordinary effect, as he repeats the hues 1: has written for the players, inaudibly, wit a rapid movement of the lips, his face change mg every moment to increased pallor an ghastlier sigmQcance He raises intense stealthily from the carpet of skins he lies of with a series of snake Uko movements, as to things at the Queen the terrible taunts in the next, until at last he gains his feet with spring, and the crowded stage is emptied i an instant no one sees how, and the triumphant miserable Prince of Denmark : alone with his victory of wretchedness Among the numerous comments which have bead involving comparisons between the Hamlet of Mr Irving and that of his: predecessors the most unfavourable hay been made by the admirers of Mr Macready; They pronounce Mr Irving deficient i dignity, and they especially regret the absence of that intense and terrible hatred towards the King, Yvlnch, they say, so in flamed and devoured Mr. Macready, that never left his face for a moment, but expressed itself in every glance and movement I think this difference is consistent with the whole of Mr Irving's conception and po: traiture of Hamlet, which is strictly an curiously introspective Trots the descriptions I have heard of Mr Macready s Harr let, I feather that it was quite the opposite, watchful, observant, busy representation eager to confirm by his own proofs the ghost statements before he made up his mind t "take the ghosts word for a thousand pounds and occupied as much by the ss ternal world as by the terrible visitant whose behest be hesitates so unaccountably t fulfil. Nothing could be more widely dif- ferent from Mr. Irving's Hamlet, who, from the first moment of his entry upon the scene is completely possessed and engrossed by his grief and disgust the latter feeling is more strongly expressed, and so admirably, that the intensity does away with the unpleasant effect of some of the coarse phrases, to plain for modern ears, in which Hamlet denounces his mother and his uncle-am the addition of the supernatural element only plunges him deeper into an abstraction which already exists, embues his speculations on the future, his efforts to read the riddles of the present, with darker gloom and adds bitterness to his self knowledge and to his contempt of others. It is no ghost who has taught in an hour "Young Hamlet" the clear insight and the cynics scorn which exhibit themselves in the dialogues with Polonius and the application of the self same method to Osnc Mr Irving is steadily consistent all through to the idea which he presents at the first moment of his appearance, and that ideal is such as to deprive the oath which Hamlet takes (to himself) after the ghost disappears of much of its significance There is but little hope or joy left to be renounced by the mood] Prince who follows his "aunt mother' to the palace hall, and is reproved by her because his eyes are still " seeking his noble father in the dust The burden on his heart can scarce be heavier, the added lost is laid on the soul and on his nerves Mr Irving conveys in a manner which I cannot believe has ever been or can ever be surpassed, the weakness in Hamlets nature and the combination of rage and superstition which animates him in that terrible scene in which he steals on the king, during his agony of remorse (1 asking the grace of repentance, and is withheld from killing him only by the fear of sending him to Heaven This one of the most daring and consummate flights of Shakspeare's genius, is a scene from which the most accomplished interpreter of that genius might well shrink and indeed, I am told by old playgoers that it has rarely been acted, though it seems to me the tree feeds must suffer sadly, and the character of the King be deprived of all poetical and dramatic skill and delineation, and be reduced to a mere representation of monstrous wickedness a horror of thick darkness, quite unworthy of the mighty master, by its excision At about this scene the defects of the play, in a dramatic point of view, the abso lute lack of interest, of mobility, of light and shade in every character except Hamlet- who only Yards, and is quite human all through would be increased, I venture to think, to an unpardonable extent Thissceneonlydifferen states the King from the Queen , this scene only exhibits the working of any other mind among the number engaged, apart from the direct action upon them of Hamlet It is a minor consideration, but yet one which ought not to be overlooked, that this Scene only gives to any actor who has to play the difficult, ungracious, and unpleasant part of the King a chance of gaining distinction in it, Of this opportunity Mr, Swinbourne, Yvlioplajs the King to Air. Irving's Hamlet aVails himself, he acts remarkably well in it 'The Queen, represented by Miss Pauncefort, execrably dressed in a gown made of something which looks like Yellow chess boards, and jewels only fit for the co rest burlesque, has more chance of individualism herself in the terrible scene between the mother and the son, a scene which bears a wonderful testimony to the power of genius by the environment in which it holds us, despite its odious mean 'ng, and the unbounded unnatural horror of the situation, the revolting nature of Hamlets reproaches, and the careless cold- bloodedness of the avengerofblood, when he himself becomes a murderer by killing Polonius the Queen has her oppor vainly Miss Pauncefort does not use it to advantage, abo grimaces too much and she makes a slow exit, returning a second time from the door to kiss Hamlets hand, thus running the risk of making the whole scene ridiculous Considering that the dead body of her chief courier counsel for, and old friend is lying behind the arras -fresh murdered by her son-it would require an agonised absorption in her own remorse, and a truly distracted anguish under the reproaches of Hamlet, to render her oblivion of the fact endurable I might be rendered so, if she staggered blindly away from her son with his den eyes, and broken sons, on his stern, scornful dismissal, but it is quite intolerable when she returns, to slow music, to kneel beside Hamlet, and receive a solemn " Good night," together with the ancient Danish equivalent for a bedroom candle Mr Irving has introduced an tune vation nto this celebrated scene, which is much discussed, but which I admire extremely though I am altYO to the cogency of the objections raised against it by those who contend that an actor ought not to leave of the Groundlings ' out of account altogether by appealing to an exclusively cultivated and aesthetic taste. There are no portraits on the walls of the Queen'aroom, in which the terrible interview to which the Queen summons hamlet takes place. He wears no miniature of his father, she no miniature of his uncle "Look on this portrait, and on this ! "-the famous point' in the scene, is made after an entirely new fashion As Hamlet t> his father, when he fondly dwelt upon noble form and princely qualities to Moral in his mind's eye, so he sees him, so forces his struggling and reluctant mother see him when he bids her "look ' W [ wrapt gaze, one hand gripping feet 1 arm, the other pointing to the very air, he sketches the two portrait The effect is very fine indeed, a I don't believe that it is lost upon I least instructed member of the numere audience, who are perfectly still absorbed attention deeper than I have over been seen manifested in a London theatre do I think the least instructed member that audience fails to catch the exquisite marked transition of the actor, from the s< conjured phantom, of his brain, the di invoked vision of the fathers well remo bered face, untroubled by the memory of t awful ghost which so lately laid its stern best upon him, to the perception of an awful ghost itself, as it glides into sight, unseen by his mother, a the assured commanding tone dies away hollow tremulousness In the scene with the "recorder' i Irving's acting is exceedingly fine, the si picion to which he is driven with such ma fest reluctance , the sharp pain with whom he recognises the treachery of his quondam friends, the piteous frank appeal he i dresses to Rosencrantz and Gildenstern , t dexterity of the test he applies to them, t scorn with which he tosses the broken pi away, and tells them they cannot pi upon ' him are all perfect in their r. pression. They are also exquisitely true the inconsistent sensitiveness of the man w has no tenderer epitaph than, farewell, the rash intruding fool, for his fathers c servant and his lady love's father, slain his hands, but who winces like a worn from the stroke of personal unkindness a treachery, or attempted cajolery from t object of his own personal regard The cor plex character of the great Shakspeare enigma is sustained from first to last, as if the concluding act fails to excite an interest as the preceding acts, I venture think it is because the material does n exist. In the churchyard scene the acting Mr. Irving is impressive, but he would do better if he dropped Yonck's ski himself, instead of handing it to Horatio There is a touch of the "gentlemen in waiting " about Horatio s action ju here which is objectionable There is b much philosophy but too little feeling also Mr. Irving s soliloquy He comments on the disgust with which " poor Yonck's" reli inspire him-he does not struggle with it, 1 is not sorry for it, as his childish memory of an old friends kindness ought to w him to be He is hard and graceless c through this scene, and his sudden leap in life on the discovery that Ophelia is a corpse just laid in the grave is mere go vanism. The difficulties of this act has always seemed come to be almostinsurmoun able, and Mr Irving does not surmount the quite successfully, or reconcile us to its n congruities In the last scene his acting again perfect in the acceptance of a challenge, in the whispers with Horatio in the formal courtesies exchanged with Laertes in the first crossing of the rapiers, the growing excitement, the pause the fierce putting out of skill and strength, the dexterous changing of the sword, the play of countenance, the house awakened by the revelation of Laertes, in the grand consummation of all his treasure wrath and tardy vengeance, trebly justifies with which Hamlet kills the King, i his dying struggle with Horatio to prevent his drinking the poisoned wine and in his own death, Mr Irving achieves last and a complete triumph I cannot be lieve that "The rest is silence" he ever been more effectively faltered out that by this Hamlet, as he drags heavily down -maids from the vain hold of Horatio s armS with eyes vaguely gazing towards " thatundis covered country' he was wont to dream of the midst of the life of a court How perfect that simile is, how effective it will be to a time, how telling it must have been when America was a new found land, and th illustrious travellers who had returned there sat among Shakspeare's audience That Mr Irving has surpassed the expectations of all among his admirers who are no fanatics must be admitted The one defect which he seems unable to surmount exist in his voice, which is harsh uncertain, am thin He manages it in Hamlet with much increased skill, but its want of melody am volume and the occasionally flat intonation are irritating in the best effects What am to say of Miss Bateman s Ophelia ' Perhaps I had better say, as Newman Noggs in Nicholas Nickleby cautiously replies to Mr Lilljvick's question concerning the Ken wigs s baby, "Well, it isn't a very nasty one Shakspeare's Ophelia is such an impossible anomaly, that I am constrained to pity any young lady who is con- devoted to act the part To assume an air of virginal candour and innocence totally in compatible with the worldly wisdom eau tion, and general "knowingness' of an unpleasant kind instilled into her mind by her father and her brother, within hearing of the audience and to be used as a tool of the divining rod kind, to detect the vein of her lovers madness, until the catastrophe which turns her own brain-this is hard enough. but the sane Ophelia who has to listen to the coats? cautioning of her father, and rug shrewdly indelicate counsel of her brother, and then to supper and sentimentalism with Hamlet as if she had not the faintest notion what either of them means, and believed in her own innocence, is tolerable in comparison with the mad Ophelia, stray- ing about the stage in a muslin chemise, dropping Mowers, and Bingingsenseless songs which an absurd stage tradition has turned into dirges, whereas, if they are to illustrate the contradictions and absurdities of mad ness at all, they ought to be sung as gaily as possible, in matches, not on grand emus Ophelia must be a bore, let who will play the part. It is impossible to admit that Miss Bateman is less of a bore than any preceding Ophelia , except in so far as Bhtjcuts the mad scene short and spares us her "mother's maid called Barbara Her voice is unpleasant, and the monotony of her enunciation is almost distracting at times Every utterance is lamentably by rose," and she has no notion of the tone and manner of rejoinder, of catching a sentence up by her reply , so that no dialogue in which she has a part takes a conversational tone , her questioner must always literally " pause for a reply," and, as the case of Hamlet, when he puts his burned question suggested by the tell tale glimpse of Polonius boland the arrival here's your father' -take the chance of having a ' point utterly spoiled This young lady is painstaking and, if she turns a deaf car to the nonsense that is talked to her about her "success she may become a very fair actress in time She has been pushed into characters to which she is entirely unsuited and unequal, because she enjoys the doubly perilous distinction of having been an infant phenomenon" and being a managers daughter If she achieves anything like a true artistes success in a career which she has entered thus overweighted, she will doses every high commendation indeed At present her performance is painfully crude and artificial, and it is always to be apprehended in such a case as hers that an actress may be flattered into imagining that her stage education is finished, while in reality Bbe boa everything to learn Miss Bateman has one great attraction she is not vulgar, over her unpleasant intonation is not of the vulgar kind, and the value of that negative quality your readers would have to make the tour of our London theatres to estimate even approximately. In them almost without exception, vulgarity reigns triumphant and unopposed, In the plays and in the players, It may fairly be objected that actresses are not in society, that they are not Given opportunities of studying the manners and modes of speech of ladies in their own houses and among their equals but the objection applies more stringently to Trend act leases who are much more strictly excluded from society who are in fact set out by a rule to which, no exception exists and yet Trench actresses can play the parts of ladies as well as if they were not only to the manner born but to the custom educated in every day life Madame Arnould Plessy is a; perfecta?)anddame bothe and off the stage as ever combined race with simplicity ml run with gentleness poor Dcselce though not so refined was thoroughly ladylike and I could enumerate many others to whom the slightest solecism in speech or manner would be impossible Here there is nothing but sole claims in speech in action in dress and the ideas which are supposed to repress in modern life are as unlike the original as the actors are unlike the men and women whom they are supposed to imitate To this rule the Prince of Wales Theatre offers at this time a striking exception Mrs Bancroft (Miss Marie Wilton has always been remarkable for the quietness and finish of her acting She never permits archness to degenerate into impudence est Sarcherie to be come fast or ease to drop into vulgar familiarity and she has preserved these characteristics through the trying ordeal of a long series of so called comedies of modern life by the late Mr Robertson In several of these plays there is a great deal of merit but it does not include a resemblance to the manners and speech of ladies and gentlemen and in none of the series is the absence of such resemblance more conspicuous than in the comedy entitled Society Mrs Bancroft contrives to make even the preposterous heroine of this weak and ill constructed i lay a refined and ladylike girl Her Lady Teazle is to my mind perfect and indeed she has not only no e trial at present but no competitor At the Prince of Wales they are playing an exquisite little piece such as is rarely indeed seen on any stage since the horrid reign of burlesque and opera bouffe the arch and types alike of art and nature has been confirmed by the deplorable fiat of degenerate public taste it is written by Mr. W. S. Gilbert t who calls it Sweethearts a Dramatic Contrast The story is very simple and is in two scenes the first represents a coquettish misunder standing and parting between two lovers the second represents their meeting again after an interval of 32 years during which neither has married and their reconciliation Tull of humour and yet exquisitely touching this little piece is a perfect gem and it is acted with perfection worthy of it by Mrs Bancroft in the part of Miss Northcott Mr Coghlan who plays the part of Henry Spreadbrod - originally intended for Mr Hare - is hardly up to the mark of the elderly gentleman in which Mr Hare would have been admirable but he does the young love business decidedly better than that hardest and driest of clever but unsympathetic actors could possibly do it Still everyone regrets that Mr naro has left the Prince of Wales and in the case of Sweet hearts it is particularly to be regretted because it is always important that the impression to be created last should be favourable Lecoq has succeeded Offenbach as the ii rare of the day At the St. James a at the Strand at the Philharmonic (with Saturday afternoon excursions to the Gaiety) they are playing English (and desperately dull) over signs of his extravagant and tasteless productions The music is sparkling and pretty and sufficiently acceptable when it is played on the piano or by a band but the plays if they must be so designated are beneath criticism and degrading to actors year able of much better things
