'MACBETH. - - , Mr.' Thomas Kenny, a clever essay ist, and Avlio has written most ably on , ihe subject of " Macbeth," 'cliaract.r-' ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime and terror relieved by the niost niau-' nificent imaginative exprc.ssion," yet marked with great siinplicity'of general design. The date of the production of the piece is set by Furnival at 1605-6. and "Ave may take il;'; for' granted," snj's Kenny, "that it was Avritten in the time of James the First, who ascended the throne March, 1603, as it contains an evident allusion to that moniirchlivlacbiv.': scene. ;i,: and also a complimentary reference to him in an other part. ; Tlie; material Tor the play Avas foinul -by. .Shakespeare in Holin- shcd's History of Scotlainl, where the story of Macbeth is told at page 16S." The Macbeth and Duncan arc repre sented to have been cousins ; the lirst a valiant gentleman but! of .cruerdispb- , ' sition, and the latter " so soft ' and I gentle in hi.s nature th.-.t the people ' wished the inclination and manners of ' i the two to- have- been so teinpcred and . I iiitGichang.ably shared - betwi.xt them that Avherc the one had, top much of I clemency and the' other of cruelty, the I main -I'iflue between these two e.xtre- mities might have reigned by inciiffcr- 1\. ent partition in them both. The play I all along keci>s close to the line of Holinslied, varying from it in scarcely I any particular except in the non- . appearance in the banquet scene of the ' inurdercd Bantpio's gliost." ( This tragedy h.ns been presented in Melbourne wc believe oftener than any ' other of Shakespeare's works. The I late G. V.
