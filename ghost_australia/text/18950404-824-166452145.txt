A DRAMATIC CRITIC'S DREAM. As I tossed in my bed with a very hot head, And t'other extremity cold, I found myself musing, and freely abusing ^>3 The liquor a pnblican sold. v Now, I hadn't been tight, during the night I had sipped a few sherries and bitters; But I'd been at "The Queens," and had haricot beans, Steak pie, and a couple of fritters. P'raps that may account for the awful amount Of notions that entered my brain, For the way I got muddled, and lovingly cuddled My pillow and soft counterpane. I had been at the play—-quite a week I should say— Seen Richard, and Mister Macbeth, That insane chappie, Hamlet, who utters a damlet When doing his uncle to death.

Oh ! it's awful to wake With a head like to break ; For you get no repose With your knees at your nose; And your tongue is as dry As the wing of a fly. Ypu feel quite undone, Like a Monday bath-bun; And fancy you'll crack As you turn on your back -To sleeplessly wait for the morning. T. T.j in Bon-Accord.
