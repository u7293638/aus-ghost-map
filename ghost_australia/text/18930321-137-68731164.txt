A Diference of Opinion. What constitutes the point of a joke is largely a matter of opinion. A German one day expressed himself as being some what offended because an American gear tleman had asserted that his Teutonic countrymen could not as a rule appreciate American jokes. "Try one on n me" said Ihe defiantly, and the Americanu accordingly told hinm the story of the tree "out west" which was so high that it took two men to see to the top. One of them saw as far as he could, and then the second began to look at the spot ~'where the first stopped seeing. The recital did not raise the ghost of a smile upon the Gerulan's face, and the other soid to him: "Well, you see, the joke is lost on you, You can't appreciate American humor." "Oh, but," said the. German, with the frankness characteristic of his country men, "that is not humnor-that is one lie!" -Tit-Bits.
