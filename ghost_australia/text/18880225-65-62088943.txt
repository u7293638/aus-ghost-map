THE LATE MUNICIPAL ELECTION.-We under- stand that every effort is being made to find some tangible reason for upsetting the recent election, and of coarse upsetting the ratepayers' choice. Everything that can be considered a lache is being used, but we are assured, on the most reliable authority, not local either, that the Opposition have not the ghost of a chance of succeeding. The question regarding the few declaration forms, even allowing these few were declared informal, the result of the election would not be altered and the numbers would remain the same for those re- turned, besides even allowing the election was de- clared informal, the ratepayer have the power to return the same men. There is no disputing the fact, that the ratepayers are determined that " new blood" shall eccnpy the Aldermanic chairs, and there is no UBe whatever in trying to override their wishes.-Chronicle. A LEGAL LAPSE -Mr. O'Mara, who is defending the young man Sullivan, charged with having murdered Margaret Kennedy, complained to his Honor Sir George Innes, of the slip-shod manner in which the case had been given to him in his brief. His Honor in reply said that he sympathised with Mr. O'Mara, and the way in which the solicitor's business had been conducted in the case was most discreditable.-E. News.
