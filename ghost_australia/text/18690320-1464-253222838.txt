A YOUNG LADY'S WELCOME TO PRINCE ALFRED. (Per Favor of Mr. Punch.) Oh ! how delightful ! Come at last ! How wearily the time has past, Dear Prince, since last you left us ; While, ever dinned into our ears, The tales of ghosts, and plots, and biers, Of sense has near bereft us ! And will you dance with us again t I hope, though, that you will refrain From noticing Miss Miggles — The odious creature, I declare She'd almost make a parson swear (As pa says) when she giggles ! I hope you'll speedily begin To let us hear your violin — I'm told you play it finely ; And oh ! what fun the time to kill With Lancers, Gab p, or Quadrille— You know we dance divinely. Do stop a month at least ; you'll see How pleasantly the time will flee, With welcome true and hearty- ; And while you're here, you may be bound No lack of pleasure will be found From ball to picnic party.
