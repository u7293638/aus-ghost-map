The device adopted was a most ingénions oheV but luckily, was frustrated. A stranger waited on the manager of the Mont de Piete, requesting an advance of £8W on a quantity1 of brandy, rum, and whisky in bulk, stored tn bond, on which duty was alleged to naveTwin £aid. Inspection of stock was invited, luckily the managing director for the mouth happened to be one of the leading wine and spirit merchants in Sydney, and hil suspicions were aroused hythe statement of duty having' been paid. The duty would amount to over £3000. He accordingly told the manager to communicate with tho detectives, and get the Cmrtowgoflicer to go with him to inspect the stock, ^fcyrrival at the store, the casks of Buppçeodej^Bte were there, with the stranger and a stor^Bn in charge, Unfortunately the Custongfl^Ber was in uniform, and conse 0,'ientIj^KrmcJ thc rogues. A cask was selected and everything got ready for a trial, when the stranger begged to be excused for a moment, and went outside. Half an hoar elapsed, and as be did not return, th» store man said he would fetch him, and went out also. Neither returned, and on hour and a half being consumed In further waiting, it was determined to take a sample from the cask. The syphon was Inserted, and brought out excellent spirit, but being inserted again it had to be dipped a long way down before the spirit could bc obtained. The investiga- tion Bhowcd a tin tube, about 8 In. in diameter, had been inserted right through the cask from side to side, which was filled with spirit. Tito rest of the cask was Siled with water. AU thc casks were filled in the sam« way. It ls believed the swindle mast ha vé cost £200 to prepare, The swindlers hiv« Bo) been seen since.
