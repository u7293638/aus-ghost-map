ST. PAUL’S CHURCH, BALLARAT EAST. The sermons were preached by the vicars Rev. A. J. H. Priest. In the morning he continued a course of sermons on the Apostles’ Creed. After dealing with the work of the Holy Ghost in tho Christian dispensation, the preacher dwelt upon the Spirit’s influence through the church, visible and invisible, upon mankind. He then pointed out that members nf Christ’s church, inheritors of a glorious pist and noble pre sent, looking forward to a brighter future, should put forth every effort to lead holy lives and benefit their fellow-meD. In the evening the textohoßen was I Chr., 29, 14, “ All things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.” Mr Priest began by briefly referring to the circum stances under which the words were Bpnken, pointing out that they were of eternal signi ficance, as in the principle that all things are from G'<d, we have the foundation of all generosity'aud liberality. The preacher then reviewed in outline the discoveries of modern science, showing that they should deepnn the senße of dependence nn God. He showed how in the acquisition of wealth both talents and opportunities are nf God, while, after people have realised indepen dence, they are Btill dependent on Him. From the thought that all is from God, then follows the practical duty of giving to God. The J«ws gave one-tenth of their produce and Jacob a tenth of his income, and many Christians felt it their duty to do the name.- If people would only give systematically there would be no lack of money for the Lord’s work. The preacher closed by an earnest appeal on behalf of the charities. The following special music was rendered during the day; Morning—Anthem, “Blessed be the name of the Lord” (Gadsby); offertory solo, “ Thy rebuke” (Handel). Evening—Anthem, “Hearken unto Me” (Sullivan); offertory solo, “ With verdure clad ” (Haydn).
