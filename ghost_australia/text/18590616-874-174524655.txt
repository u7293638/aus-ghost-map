THE SOCIAL EVIL. A HINT. (BY THE GHOST OF BURNS.) Ye moral men wha's blameless lives, E'en slander o' its tongue deprives-- Wha stap at hame ye'er weans an' wives, Alane caressin', And a' temptation vainly strives— To send transgressin'. What tho', whyle back ye may hae went Frae the comman' a wee bit sklent— Now ye'er groun auld ye do repent, An' twa'r three year; O' better ways wipes out a' print— O' man's career. Once ev'ra year ye meet to balk Their ways, wha sae disgracefu' walk, Wha at some corner laugh an' talk Fu' i' your sight; An' wi' bare heads an' shouthers stalk, I' braid day light. This night I'm gi'en to understan', Ye'er gaun a spierin' out some plan To cleanse this else immac'late lan' Frae women vile— Nae mair shall they poor thoughtless man— To sin beguile. Poor harmless man, wham they seduced Wha's blastit name can be produced To show how he hae been traduced, A' o'er the warl'— Man, wha ne'er yet the faith abused, O' ony girl. Nae doubt they're a' alike depraved-- Alike a' thought o' shame hae braved, Sae jist mix up the misbehaved, Vile social vermin, All in one place—wha's d----d or saved, Let chance determine. Nae doubt 'twas them an' them alane, The moral pestilence set gane First put the deeper dark'nin stain, On human nature; Branded it wi' disgrace sae plain On ev'ra feature. Nae doubt its them wha keep it goin' For men are now sae virtuous groun, That were they a' jist let alone To their ain ways, In social life wad soon be known Millennial days. If sic's the case, its nocht but fair That a' the odium they should bear,— But some o' ye—jist have a care, What way ye speak, Or what ye've done, ye'll maybe hear Some ither week.
