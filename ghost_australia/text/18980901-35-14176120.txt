FEDERATION. On ? THE PREMIER'S RESOLUTIONS, MOTION BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. SPEECH BY THE PREMIER. HE REVIEWS THE FEDERAL MOVEMENT. EXPLAINS THE PRESENT SITUATION. ASKS FOR GENERAL SUPPORT. THE SPEECH WELL RECEIVED. In the Legislative Assembly last evening the PREMIER moved the federal resolutions as follows - " That, in view of the nearly equally divided vote of the electors of New South Wales on June J list upon the question of the acceptance or rejection of the bill framed by the Convention constituted under the Fe local Enabling Acts, and the fact that the statutory number of votes in its favour was not recorded, and in view of the conclusion, confirmed by the results of the recent general election, that the but is not acceptable to the electors of this colony in its present shape, although the electors have made it clear that they are strongly in favour of union with the sister colonies upon lines which can be mutually accepted as fair and just to all, this House affirms " (1) Ita desire that steps should be taken without delay in conjunction with the other colonies to bring about the completion of federal union " (2) Its desire that the other colonies should agree to reconsider those provisions of the bill most generally objected to in New South Wales, namely " (a) Representation in the Senate concerning which this House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that, if equal representation be insisted upon, the provision for a three-fifths majority at a joint sitting of both Houses should be removed, and that a simple majority should decide, or that the provision for a joint sitting be replaced by a provision for a national referendum " (b) The 87th Clause, known as the Braddon Clause concerning which the House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that this clause should be removed from the bill " (c) The Capital of the Commonwealth concerning which Una House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that changes 124 should be amended, and provision made in the bill for the establishment of the federal capital in such place within the boundaries of New South Wales as the Federal Parliament may determine " (d) The Boundaries of State- i concerning which this House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that better provision should be made against the alteration of the boundaries of a State without its own consent namely, by the protection afforded by claude 127, as to the representation of States " (e) Inland Rivers concerning which this House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that the use of inland rivers for purposes of water conservation and irrigation should be more clearly safeguarded. " (f) Money Bills concerning v. Inch this House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that there should be a uniform practice in respect to such bills, namely, that provided in the case of Taxation Bills, and bills for the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth " (g) Judicial Appeals from States concerning which this House desires to submit for the consideration of the other colonies that the mode of appeal from the Supreme Courts of the States should be made uniform, namely, the appeal should either be to the Privy Council or to the High Court, but not as at present indiscriminately to either " 3 Although prepared, for the sake of union if it be placed in other respects upon a fair and just footing-to accept the financial system embodied in the bill, with the one exception mentioned, this House earnestly invites further inquiry into, and a more thorough consideration of the financial clauses, regarding as ev is to be avoided in possible excessive burdens of taxation, a prolonged system of book keeping, uncertainty as to the amount of the surplus to be divided, and uncertainty as to the method of distressing it among the States " He said Mr Speaker, in moving these resolutions I feel that I can, with great confidence, rely upon the indulgent attention of this House, and I should like to say at once that it would be far more convenient to me dealing with the multitude of subjects to which I must refer, if any members who have questions to address to me would kindly postpone them until I have concluded, when I shall be glad to answer anything which by that time seems to have been neglected AN INTERESTING AND CRITICAL STAGE There is no doubt that we have reached a most interesting and critical stage in connection with the movement for federal union, and nothing could have been more striking than the marvellous development of sympathy and interest in connection with this object during the past two or three years I do not wish to claim any undue credit for the Government of the last Parliament in connection with that development but I think him entitled to say that the movement began to acquire genuine life and power from the time that the public men of Australia decided to put it within the reach of the personal interest and initiative of the whole body of the Australian electors (Hear, hear ) Of course, it will probably seem marvellous to the historian of the future that there should have been within a comparatively short time such a marked evolution from the policy of separation v bach was rampant in these colonies not many years ago CHANGE FROM SEPARATION TO FEDERATION I suppose everyone in this House, even the youngest member, will recollect that at one time the last thing talked of was the union of these Australian colonies. There was a constant feeling of an opposite character desire to set up independent forms of Government animated by feelings I will not say of away but certainly keen feelings of emulation, and unfortunately when different parts of this great continent were endowed with free and large powers of self- government those powers were used in a way in connection with fiscal policy which certainly did not tend to promote good feeling between the colonists of Australia (Hear, hear ) However, looking back upon those rivalries, I think we can see now that they had their good effect, that in point of fact the developments which flowed from them have hastened and opened the conditions under which it would have become possible for the colonies to unite PROVINCIALISM A TERM OF REPROACH And so with premnciabsm This is a term which is now used as a term of reproach, but there is no doubt the spirit of provincialism in post years in exciting a desire to five us apart, has had an important effect in stimulating the development of these great political divisions of Australia, and in stimulant 1 ing their development, strength and wealth, the time for federal union is undoubtedly been hastened All this wonderful change from the green fields of separation, of hostile tariffs, of separate ambition of provincial ideas, to a general desire and ambition for a union of the colonies is, I think, one of the most rapid processes which has been notice- able in national development They certainly give very little colour to the somewhat hysteric impatience of many people in connection with this great movement and with the desire to arrive at a thoroughly sound and well-considered constitution MR REID'S OPPONENTS IRRATIONAL If there is one regrettable circumstance in the record of those who are considered to be the most sincere, ardent, respectable federalists of Australia, it has been the utterly irrational way in which they have dealt with the serious and sensible objections raised to any particular form of federal constitution which has been submitted to the people of Australia. (Hear, hear ) One would think that they imagine that there can be some logical process of arriving at first hand at a perfectly well-balanced and satisfactory form of federal government for the Australian people There is no more difficult task to set the most profound statesmen than that of framing a sound federal constitution for the people of any nation But the difficulties in the way of such men when they essayed at first band to frame a perfect constitution for people so keen, intelligent, and independent in their instincts, blessed with a political constitution which has accustomed them to so large a measure of political freedom themselves, was so great that if it were expected that even the most profound statesmen could hit off a perfect constitution, it shows, to my mind, that they have not mastered thoroughly all the intricacies of the federal problem TWO WAYS OF GETTING A CONSTITUTION There are two ways of dealing with this problem One is infinitely more simple than the other. It is to accept any thing; that has been framed There is nothing more simple than to accept the bill which has been brought up, to shut one's eyes to its principles, its contrivances, and all the probabilities of its operations On the other hand, it is the honest way to set ourselves to test the bill, to discover by reason and history and experience whether it has been well drawn, whether its important principles are sound, whether they have been used in such a form as to work harmoniously, whether, having arrived at a stage of perfection as a piece of machinery, it also fairly and safely recognises the varied interests and rights of different part, of this continent Any person who sets him self to a task of that kind must have found in the bill framed by the Convention of 1891 a great deal of material for sense. doubts as to whether that bill as a whole in one which the different peoples of Australia could fearlessly accept oanfcM I was one of those who did endeavour to test that bill, there were others who, I will not say did not endeavour to test the bill-men of great ability and of undoubted patriotism-but who unhesitatingly accepted was one of the marvels of constructive statesmanship One particularly of the leading newspapers of this country, which had earned a reputation for caution and prudence,, then for the first time in its experience was betrayed into unbounded natures in the presence of this almost divine masterpiece of the English language, and that very worthy and influential newspaper has never yet recovered from that spasm of unbounded admiration There were others in the public life of this country who took their cue from the same inspiration They were men or high ability, and vast experience some of them men whom the people might well follow were amongst the number Now, the only reasonable construction in the light of experience and in the light of universal opinion to-day is that those npc judgments were so eager to realise the grand object of Australian federal union that they altogether subdued their critical faculty, believing no doubt that in the course of time those things it Inch were wrong and worked ill could be remedied I would sincerely sympathise with that attitude if I did not draw a very sharp distinction between measures such as we deal with in this Parliament and a measure of a federal character The federal Constitution cannot be altered It is a deed of partnership entered into voluntarily) by independent persons to unite upon a certain basis That is very different to the case of a man who pursues his business alone are here in local legislation a de- fective bill was passed in the anticipation of altering it subsequently it is a case of one man acting alone Alone the man can alter and modify his arrangements, but once he finds himself governed by a deed of partnership his Lavadia! initiation n nil liberty) is absolutely destroyed I her it depends not on him alone to remedy faults, and when one r< utter in a general partnership seeks to alter the deed it is a perfectly fair retort on the part of another parties that he should have satisfied himself as to the terms of the deed before he signed. (Hear, hear ) THE DEADLOCK QUESTION That view his always had this effect upon my mind I am often led into imaginative views on politics, and I have often felt in connection with this great question of framing a constitution that while it is in one sense to enlarge our powers of self-government, that piece of word-painting the enlargement of our powers of self-government is true in one sense, but it has a reverse side In many respects it absolutely obliterates our powers of self- government that if the powers which those colonies have to-day under their free constitutions I feel the pressure of tire bill so strongly that I have all through tried to apply any critical faculty 1 possess to the study of every bill which has been submitted with the object of accomplishing federation WTieuI applied another bill of "it I felt bound to resist the bill most strongly (Heir boa--) The leading part I took in that attitude of hostility has been abundantly justified by public opinion of to day (Hear, hear) The leading objection which I advanced against the bill has been abundantly justified by those who then did not agree with me in the first place, I objected that whilst it established two Houses of Parliament, and surrounded them with a set of complex relations and duties, it absolutely neglected one of the first duties of constructive states- manship-the providing of an escape it to the working of the machine a state of tension and difference between the two branches of the Legislative occurred The bill was absolutely devoid of such a provision It was then said in the well-phrased platitude that 'leaders save the price of constitutional liberty " (Hear, hear.) I was not satisfied with that (Ministerial cheers ) "in mist the matter is of small importance when all is smooth, it may become a matter of infinite concern if the two great Parliamentary forces of the Commonwealth are thrown into a state of hopeless and bitter antagonism What is the function of Parliament ? What is the principle of the Houses the device of two Houses may be intended to throw a wholesome influence of restraint over the legislation in certain cases to act as a very strong break, so that nothing can be done until the people are appealed to But in this Parliamentary constitution that appeal to the country was manned and imperfect A deadlock might have been wholly caused by au utterly irrational attitude of hostility on the part of the Senate to a measure of reform of almost universal popularity The names of the House of Ilepre cutatives in insisting upon the completion of that race of legislation may not only be eminently wise in itself, but also, as I have said, by the unmistakable verdict of the whole of the constituency of Australia be approved and yet under that constitution the Senate is as put in the position which could only be described as that of a dictator, the enormous strength of the position of the Senate was that whilst the House of Represen- Uli i es was intended to wholly change its character every three years, the theory with reference to the heats was that it was to be an immovable body only partially change- able at intervals I was told by the most able and learned federalists of the day that when I asked for a provision against deadlocks I was taking a silly course But there was no attempt to try to get rid of the anomaly THE FRANCHISE OF THE SENATE Then, again, the basis of the franchise of the Senate was radically unsound The constituency which elected the Senate was in no sense a constituency of the people. The experience of election by the Legislatures of the United States to the Senate has not been such as to make that month of of election one of a satisfactory character Then, the franchise for the House of Representatives. was also one of an exceedingly questionable character It was not on the basis of one man one vote or one adult one vote All these consisted' electoral systems of the different colonies were allowed free play in connection with the national House of Representatives I think we can all fairly say now that one of the essentials of a national House of Representatives is a uniform national franchise RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT Then, again, one of the vital principles of every British community, from the mother country exceed ing to every colony possessing responsible government, is responsible government Responsible government is the very essence of democratic control The difference between self-govern event and the more fashionable forms of government is the difference between the British Minister to-day in England, or the colonial Ministers as in IS on South Wales, and the Ministers of Charles I or Henry Till It is a vital difference, and it is in consequence of the fact that Ministers have been made whilst in form the serv ants of the Crown in spirit, and in fact the servants of the people, and liable to dismissal by the people is that which constitutes the glory of British political institutions to day (Hear, hear ) I look through the constitution of 1891 in vain for any recognition of that principle, and looking through the debates I find that the matter had been fully and ably debated, and it was deliberately left out so that freedom might be allowed for possible evolutions of the future which might cause the change from responsible government to same other form of government such as in America, where the President is master of his ministry and the representatives of the people have not the slightest control over them If the future suggests so radical a change in the principles of a constitution, that change should not come from Ministers or from Governora-lieneral, but from the deliberate will of the people expressed in the name of the constitution RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT There are others who bitterly complain as to the bill of 1891 that a treat it gave the power to the federal Parliament to annul any law or regulation imposed by this Parliament or by the Railway Commissioners in working the railways of the colony, and in that way gave a perfect control, there was no accompanying financial responsibility imposed upon the Federal Parliament in connection with our railways which they were to have these powers over. I consider that a monstrously unfair provision No Federal Parliament can be allowed to interfere with the working of the State railways unless there it some fine cial responsibility taken or some authority in the constitution expressly to safeguard the rights of the people of this colony or or any other colony in that respect. The most radical subject in 1891 to consider at all- that of providing a remedy for dead- locks-was the subject in 1918 which took up most of the time and called forth the ablest debates, and in regard to which there was an honest attempt at solution Then, as to the franchise of the Senate. Consider the improvement involved in the fact that instead of some sort of Parliamentary election and our experience of Parliamentary elections is not of the happiest description, even for such humble posts as the Public Works Committee we have been saved by the C invention of 1893 from that sort of election and that sort of constituency And the change is one of vast improvement, too , because the Senate stands upon not only a democratic, but almost a national basis All the senators have to be chosen by all the electors of each of the States on the basis of one man one vote, or, where female suffrage prevails, on the basis of one adult one vote "So, I say that the constituency of the people will do more to make the Senate a respected and (useful body in the Federal Commonwealth than any other device which we could suggest Then, again, instead of being an immovable body not exposed to the very essence of dissolution one of the best and greatest alterations in that bill is that if a great struggle difficult ances between the two Houses designed to legislate, and their functions an inoperative, they are both exposed to the same penalty that is to say, they may both be dissolved That to consider a great reform RAILWAYS AND RIVERS 1 hour with reference to the railways and rivers of New South Wales A very great deal has been done to place them in a infer position, although, as to the rivers, I still think there is something which remains to be done But in all these important respects the time that has elapsed between the year 1891 and 1893, instead of throwing federation out of the political arena, as was then predicted- because we » ere then told that if that bill was not accepted the colonies would drift into a state of disunion and misrule experience has shown that, whatever politicians or orators may say, the great bulk of the Australian people are not under the influence of the weak, hysterical feeling which is so commonly, assigned to them All through the history of these colonies there has run one to think it whilst the statesmen and the newspapers have been nearly now says quarrelling, the great bulk of the Australian people have been animated by good and friendly feeling and so far from the disappointment of 1891 having shipwrecked the cause of federal union, the progress of federal feeling and federal sentiment was never more striking or more ready than it has been since the movement left the politician and was left in the hands of the people themselves A COMPARISON OF? PARTIES Now, I would not have made these somewhat IT.-5t*? observations with reference to the bill of 1891 if the situation which existed in 1891 had not been exactly repeated in the year 1898 the Mme hysterical productions, the Bank frenzied eagerness, the same violent abuse, the game persistent charge of inuncerity-n.il levelled against those who took the trouble to think, and had the independence to express their thoughts (Applause) Every man all over this great colony who has suppressed his powers of discrimination, who did not take the trouble to to read the bill, who relied upon the oratorical explanations of the friend of union-every one of those men was a federalist of the purest, the most enlightened, the most discriminat- ing kind. Only those were traitors, only those were anti- federalists who had to the charge of the duty of insisting upon a better bill hear, hear) and the same wave of odium swept over this country in 1895 which would have swept over the country I ice if there had been the same amount of electioneering Now, I say that those who stand up to-day and point out the reasons why the bill should be more carefully scrutinise d 'why it should be improved, stand in a position in which all the resumptions are in their favour the HistoRY or the movement And now I will go back to the history of this movement for a fc v moments When the bill of 1891 which had been her chief as a perfect measure was in hands of those who believed it to be a pot feet measure, and who had the power of office to push it through, a singular development occurred The bill day by day de lined and dropped from the noble altitude Itpossossed in 1891 to such an anomalous hopeless position that no one knew where it was And yet those who had been its chief champions believing J was a perfect measure, believing that if New South Wales did not accept it there was nothing before us but misrule and anarchy An Hon Member The circumstances were different The PREMIER Well, I think I could quote several speeches of late in which the same state rents have been made The hon member has nothing to complain of unless that the " Herald " was treated you as it has us. I admit that Sir Henry Parkes had no tuna He went out of office in October, 1891 But when he went out his mantle fell upon a very able gentleman, who was in office for two years Well in those two years that great measure only got this far Mr SEE He was not Premier 'The PREMIER No but he had a pledge from the Premier that he should have a free hand, and he never ventured to face Sir George Dibbs for having broken his promise Mr CHAPMAN He had to face a vote of con- sure every week The PREMIER I will tell my hon friend why I am doing this I think that most of my colleagues and the gentlemen who have honoured me with their support throughout the federal movement are entitled to the vindication which I intend to make to-night And I think I am within the bounds of absolute accuracy when I say that during those two years from October, 18 21, to December, 1895, when Mr Barton held office, he had the pledge, and he would have had the opportunity if he pressed for it, but that perfect charter of national freedom was allowed to be obscured in dust One beginning was made We had a debate upon a general resolution that it was advisable to go into the matter But we never went into the matter afterwards An Hon. Member It is like Mr Cook's local option The PREMIER If my hon friend admits that, I am satisfied The hon. member for Ashfield, who has assumed the role of leader of the Opposition by telling the hon member to keep order, is perfectly familiar with every stage of the movement so that interruptions will not be of much service Mr SEE He does not know the facts of the case in regard to Mr Barton as well as Mr SPEAKER Order I think the hon gentleman should be allowed to proceed without in- terrupt, un The PREMIER During these two years and two mouths a full-dress vote-an abstract vote and then oblivion Well, in the course of time there was a change of Government I came into power a man who had never admired the bill, who had done all man could to prevent it from passing, who had not made the slightest pledge to the country in reference to federation, who had been denounced all these years as an enemy of Australian union I took a course there which met with the approval of the Parliament. At the first recess I asked the Premiers to meet me at Hobart And we arrived at a project, which was submitted in due course to the different Parliaments VINDICATION OF THE LATE PARLIAMENT And here I want again to vindicate the late Parliament from a gross and unfounded aspersion which was made with terrific force throughout the late election against gentlemen on this side of the House, but not against offenders on the other side I allude to the charge that those who voted for the bill increasing the minimum statutory vote from 50,000 to BO 000 had been guilty of a breach of agreement between the various colonies That statement is absolutely false There was no agreement between the Australian Premiers on that subject. Each Government and each Parliament was left absolutely free to deal with that matter as it chose. So far from wy agreement having been arrived at the official record of the conference of Premiers shows that the bill was only submitted as a type of draft bill Butt ible for consideration Now, that is a refutation at the blunders made upon the late Parliament This observation might have been made, and fairly slide, that since this colony had arrived at a mine area, and the colony of Victoria had imitated us by cutting in the same minimum, it was an undesirable flung to do to alter it when the other colonies were proceeding with this bill Now that was a fair criticism But there was a great difference between criticism of that sort and a charge of absolute breach of faith and breach of agreement PRESENT POSITION OF FEDERATION The five Parliaments that took the agreement of 1895 up were so expeditious that within a short period a bill had passed through live Parliaments which constituted the Convention of 1898 The other colonies studiously refrained from passing a bill until we had passed ours so that there was no imputation of delay upon them They passed their hill promptly on the passage of ours The arrangement was that we should pass out bill first, and it was a very proper arrangement in view of the way the other colonies had been treated by the "ardent" federalists of New South Wales As hon members know, a number of gentlemen were candidates for the Convention, and I was among them I was one who addressed a manifesto to the people And in view of the statement so often repeated that I have described a most erratic course in connection with these matters I may fairly refer, First of all, to my specific objections to the draft bill of 1891, to my manifesto of 1897, to the Governor's Speech of June last, to my manifesto to the people in July, and to the resolutions which I now submit to the House to show that during all those years my substantial ground of complaint and of principle has never shifted \ Mr A CHAPMAN Why did you vote for the Bill? The PREMIER This gentleman only wants a straw hat to complete his appearance in asking a question of that kind (Laughter ) It is a most remarkable thing that while my friends Have forgiven me for voting for the bill, the only men who cannot forgive me are those who voted for it also The Convention of 1897, considering its composition, deserves the highest degree of praise for the ability and good work which it performed in connection with the bill of 1891 The Convention had produced a bill which has this great recommendation that is, I suppose, that in point of clauses and printed matter the Convention Las lifted nine-tenths of the Constitution beyond dispute And the whole of this difficult task of reform and amendment can now be said most fairly to have been, even with the fullest measure of caution, narrowed down, if not to the subjects which the Government have named, to those subjects with perhaps one addition (Cheers) Now that is a great gain t noble advance in the history of this federation movement Whereas the bill of 1891 was so objectionable that public opinion tacitly agreed to have it smothered, in the Ministerial anteroom of New South Wales this bill of 1893 passed (with enthusiasm, in Victoria, in South Australia, and in Tasmania And in this colony it had a larger number of votes in its favour than those registered against it Now that e road state of facts shows we ought to be now within measurable distance of registering Australian union as an accomplished fact (Cheers ) I hope that this House, and I hope that all through Australia we will do our best to minimise the points of debate and consideration, because I quite admit that by every point we can drop Australian union is brought nearer Whatever side of the House we may occupy we must all feel that this great movement of federal union may be said to have passed its critical stage (Cheers ) THE CONFERENCE OF PREMIERS There are two things to be considered in connection with this matter In the first place, it is quite open to any member to agree with every word of these resolutions and yet to say he differs from the Government in one serious respect, and that is on the point of procedure A most vital point is the point of procedure I have laid on the table of the House to-night, with the permission of the Premiers of the other colonies, a number of confidential telegrams which passed between them and myself shortly after the 3rd of June On that occasion, being then in a House which was about to expire by emulsion of time, and being then about to appeal to the electors of the country, hon. members will see I was in a position vastly different from that I occupy now after the appeal to the country has taken place On June 4 t addressed the Premiers in these terms " I could not cordially support the bill framed by the Conven- tion, and I tell you frankly its prospects will not improve " I think experience has, shown that statement was correct In the same telegram I told the readers of the other colonies that I should like to take the bill in a more acceptable state to the country as a vital part of roy Ministerial policy. think that statement shows that those charges least the Government of desiring to evade respon ability and of desiring to kill federation are amply answered by the fact that I was prepared to negotiate with the other colonies on the basis of "making the amendments we advocated to the people of the country to stand or fall by them So far from bring the people, I proposed to go to the electors In those amendments as a part of the Ministerial policy. I think hon members will agree that we made a proposal which was eminently vital to bring about federal union with expedition Well, as hon "members knew, the Premier of South Australia and he Premier of Tasmania declined to join in that conference It was impossible to have a conference with those two Premiers object va. Sir George Turner showed a most (friendly and straightforward attitude, and did not give way to irritation Unfortunately he intimated bethought only immaterial matters could be dealt with I frankly told him the business was not on Emmett "Vii points, bat on matters of a substantial nature Then I have been taunted with not comply- ing with his request to be supplied with the amendments well, I think I made a perfectly fair offer in the telegram sent after the Cabinet meeting (The Premier road the telegram to the Premiers dated June 7, in which it is stated that " my colleagues cordially concur in my request to you that the Premier of the colonies represented on the Convention should meet as soon as possible to confer and sx change views as to an improvement in those provisions of the bill which Affected most seriously its success on Friday last in this colony If those men ence be agreed upon, we will undertake to prepare and send to you before its meeting; particulars of the subjects we desire to invite you to re- coils der, and our views respecting them ') When the conference broke down and the two I conners refused to meet me I decided to submit all resolutions to this House It was impossible for me to submit any amendments to Sir George Turner I was on the brink of an appeal to this country, and the only ones to whom I could summit my proposed amendments were the people of New South Wales But now the situation is altered The election has been held Ino people have had the opportunity of sending into this House 120 gentlemen representing the views of the doctors of the country I feel very strongly that if I now proceeded without reference to this Holme ignoring all the events of the (central election-and invited the Premiers to confer with me, if they were sensible men the first thing they would say would be this, " Don't you think that before you ask us to undo this great work which his has been accepted in its integrity in three colonies, you should ascertain whether in your proposals you can rely upon the Parliament of New South, W ales to back you up ?" that would place me in a position of comparative weakness in dealing with the other Premiers They would be in the position of Premiers whose colonies had unmistak- ably accepted that bill I would be in the position of the Premier of a colony in which there was so much dust produced by electioneering tactics as to produce an apparently uncertain result, and so as to complicate the verdict from the people hear, hear) So that the first thing that ought to be done to give me strength and to let the other Premiers know how things stand is that, before assuming to speak in the name of New South Wales, I should at once ascertain whether in this matter I honestly represented this House (Cheers 1 As I said on the debate on the Address in Reply, the time for deciding whether I was personally unfit to have control of this federal movement was then The result of the adoption of the Address in Reply without division was that I now stand in all terms of constitutional propriety of the authorised leader of this House and I must so Stand until my position is altered by some action of this House A " CLEAR CUT " ISSUE WANTED But that does not cover the whole of the ground. It is still a matter of the utmost consequence that this House should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on what to propose to do If in any of the amendments which we intend to propose a c do not carry with us the majority of this House, then in the name of federal union, in order to avoid delay and procrastination, that ought to be made known at once I think the people of New South Wales, and the people of Australia, are entitled to know the opinion of this House upon those matters in dispute I admit that without the support of this House my mission is idle It is a waste of time the only basis on which I can appeal to the Premiers of the other colonies is that in the suggestions which I make I am acting in harmony with the views of the representatives of the people We have yet to learn what the collective wisdom of this House u No man could possibly discover the collective ma- flora of this House from fragments in electioneering by creches Each man must register his opinion for himself (Hear, hear ) You will have observed that this has become necessary because of a change of front of a most magical kind on the part of the han member for Ashfield (Mr Wise), and also on the part of Mr Barton, Mr O'Connor, and Mr Bruce Smith When these gentlemen were before the country they identified themselves with the Opposition, and this fact gave the Opposition, it all events in the minds of ardent federalists, an enormous advantage in the first place it gave the Opposition the support of the ' Sydney Morning Herald," which they never had before, and it also gave them the support of the " Evening News, which they never had before, and these are two large and influential organs of public opinion, of whose support any man may be proud I have been proud of the support of these journals in times past, and I and of going to sneer at them now No doubt thousands of electors in this country voted with the Opposition, uotl.oc.iuso they believed in the Opposition, but because they wanted federal union at an) price There was at first a clear-cut issue When the fact was known on June 3 that the limit of 80,000 votes in favour of federation had not been reached there was a public declaration by these gentlemen as to what their policy would be It was to be a policy of repealing the 80,000 limit and passing the Commonwealth Bill as it was There would then have been a clear-cut issue before the electors One party would have come to the House and said, " We believe in the bill, and we ask you to give us strength enough to pass it as it is " That would have been a clear-cut line, because we on this side of the House made no secret of our platform, either before or after June 3 We were consistent throughout We risked our fortunes and policy on amendments, and upon resisting the bill until it was amended (Cheers.) The other gentlemen asked, not their political fortunes, but the fortunes of Ann tralia on the opposite policy in the 80,000 limit had been reached the destinies of Australia would have been fixed probably for all time, and then they would have enjoyed a legitimate triumph When the 10,000 limit was not reached, what dirt these men those Ruperts these men who gloried in nothing but their courage and their adherence to principles and loyalty to their utterances-I ask what did they do ? Well, what was the astonishment of all New South Wales when, after a perfect silence of 17 days, from the 3rd until the 20th June, to find an interview in the "Sydney Morning Herald" in which there was the statement that the bill should be amended This came from the Rupert of nil Ruperts but it must be done in a constitutional way So that, whilst the members who are on this side of the House fearlessly advocate an unchanged policy, the gentlemen on the other side have had the advantage of trying both policies the " Yes-No " attitude was performed in a series of most astonishing g) artistic movements Mr WADDELL Mr Carruthers took up the same attitude The PREMIER Mr Carruthers is all right he went before the people and pointed out a number of defects in this bill What I wish to point out is that if the Opposition had been consistent there would have been a clear cut issue raised before the Par- liament-one aide for the bill without attention, and the other against the bill as it is Mr GRIFFITH The other side would not have been here then The PREMIER By the Opposition adopting the policy of this side of the House we have n thrown into a state of confusion We do not know whether the gentlemen opposite are going to support us, or whether they are going to advocate the policy of the whole bill and nothing but the bill " But those resolutions will enable members to test the feeling of the House If members desire to accept the bill as it is they must vote age nst these resolutions The whole of these resolutions would be absolutely meaningless if the desire is to accept the bill as it stands To negative these resolutions is to vote that the bill shall be accepted as it stands If there as a m Verity in this House who hold that it is their duty to put us out of office and to negative those resolutions, and to carry an amendment to the effect that the bill in its present shape is sufficiently good for the people of New South South Wales then that ought to be done at once Members opposite must admit that I take up a fair position when I say that these resolutions ought not to be supported by anyone who is of the opinion that New South Wales should accept the Convention Bill as it stands, because I admit that any amendment of this bill must cause delay, no matter how slight, uni unless the Govornment have the unmistakable support of the House in making the amendments they want, and unless we can all unite in recommending to the people of the country certain amendments in. the bill, then it is the more straightforward and manly course for members not to vote for the resolutions Mr COPELAND Buttheiomay be differences in degree The PREMIER I admit that There may be hon. members who can fairly say, "On June 3 I was in favour of accepting the bill as it stands, but since the bill failed to receive the support of the statutory number of electors I admit that the situation is altered, and as there are such a considerable number of persons who hold a different opinion, in order to secure that unanimity of opinion so valuable in this matter we will see if it is possible to get some iiracndincuts made which will make the bill accept- able to the people of the country " Mr. E DTJEN Would it not be better now to alter the resolutions The PREMIER No If my friends opposite desire to challenge the position of the Government, they have a very easy course to take by the mouth of their leader. It is very easy to test this matter as to whether it shall be the bill or an attempt to obtain amendments in it. If the leader of the Opposition is prepared to take up the course that it shall be the bill and no amendments, it is easy to bring the matter to a conclusion (loud laughter) without engaging in a long debate upon a series of propositions to which the Opposition are opposed (Loud laughter ) I know very well that if the results of the last election had been to send into Parliament 63 advocates of the Commonwealth Bill and nothing but that bill, there would not be much trouble the part of the leader of the Opposition taking a short cut (Opposition laughter.) The laughter suggested to me that if hon members opposite had the courage to take that course probably 10 men would not vote for the in tion (Ministerial laughter ) I challenge, in the course of the debate, 10 members of the House to take up the attitude of those gentlemen on June 3 (Hear, hear ) FRIENDLY ASSURANCES ACCEPTED. Since we are to have nothing of that sort, I accept the friendly assurances which have been tendered to me by the hon gentlemen opposite, and will be most happy to receive from them any assistance they may happen to be in a position to render In this matter there are only two courses open to the House. The one is to accept the challenge, the other is loyalty to coalesced to carry this thing through in the best possible way. (Hear, hear ) Lot it by one of two things Let it be either a trial of strength on a clear-cut issue, such as the full and noble ing but the bill- (laughter) or if my friends opposite decline that I accept their attitude with satisfaction, and implore them to lend to us the patriotism of their efforts in carrying this great movement through Mr. SEE But you voted for the bill also Opposition laughter.) The PREMIER I never put myself in such a ridiculous position as the hon. gentlemen opposite in reference to any convention bill drafted between 1891 and 1898 I have always taken up the opposite attitude, and if you are not aware of it I hope you will perfect your education I have always taken up the position that both the 1891 and 1893 bill called for serious amendment. (Minister lists " Hear, hear ") WHAT THEY ARE ASKED TO ArriRM I ask the House to affirm, ns index d my f nonda opposite will have to affirm or reject, those resolutions I ask you, in the first place, to affirm that the doctors of New South Wales on June of last, on the question of the acceptance of this hill, were nearly equally divided I suppose that will be admitted, as a statement of fact I ask you to affirm that the statutory number of votes in its favour was not recorded I suppose that will be accepted as a statement of fact I also affirm that " In view of the conclusion, confirmed by the results of the recent general elec tion, that the bill is not acceptable to the electors of this colony in its present form " (Hear, hear) I ask the House to offer in or to reject that proposition It they affirm it, I will not trouble them to reject it when I and a statement, which is equally truthful, that the doctors have made it clear that they are strongly in favour of union with the aid r colonies upon lines which can be mutually accepted as fair and just to all " I do not think that proposition will be denied either The preamble rent in two or three simple afttruiahons which clear the ground, because I contend that detailed suggestions would be out of place, impertinent, and a waste of time, if a majority of the members stand by the bill without amendments THE PROPOSALS OF THE GOVERNMENT Now I come to the proposals of the Government in this matter. The first deals with representa- tion in the Senate This I have placed in the first position, because in my view this is the most important of the amendments which will be necessary in the draft bill I recognise most fully the enormous cake which the Convention took in their desire to arrive at a solution of this particular difficulty in a satisfactory manner It will be impossible to fully understand the work of the Convention without romorn being the familiar fact that 30 of the delegates represented three of the smaller populations amounting to 700,000 people, and that 20 delegates represented 2,00,000 people In common candour I must state that in the case of a majority of the delegates of New South Wales it was sometimes difficult to know what colonies they represent J (Laughter ) The Convention gave so much time to this matter that I will briefly show the different stages which it took THE DEADLOCK PROVISIONS The first Convention hold in Adelaide repeated the mistake of the 1891 Convention by absolutely refusing to put into the constitution a provision against deadlocks Ino propositions were made at Adelaide, and I regret they were made at a time when I was compelled to leave for Sydney Mr Wise made a proposition which I think, on reflection, he will admit does him little credit But he deserves this credit, that he was the first member of the Convention to endeavour to find a remedy for deadlocks He suggested that in case of a difficulty between the two Houses the Governor- General might first dissolve a the House of Representatives If, after the dissolution, and election of the new House, the difficulty remained, then there was to be a dissolution of the. Senate 1 Hat was one of the most remarkable methods of dealing with a Parliamentary difficulty that I over front of the position amounted to this the result of the election for theHouse of Representatives would show not only what the maionyoftbo people thought, but also what the O) Huon in each State was, so that the Senate would be put in the peculiarly cam ement position that if their States showed that the Senate would be picked up the senators could well stand out, and go with safety to their constituents But if the appeal to the people showed that the House of Representatives was right, and that the c should never have been a dissolution then the Senate could have caved in It had the disadvantage that it was grossly unfair to the House of Representatives as be cause if the event showed that it had pursued a course which met with the approval of the people, it was wrong that thoHou«oot Representatives, though in the right should be punished, when the Senate, which was in the wrong was saved That proposi- tion was negatived by 21 to 7 votes Mr WISE No, by 19 to 11 votes The PREMIER I find you are right Mr Isaacs, of Victoria, then came to the front with a proposal for a dual referendum Of all the refer endorsing the world I think a dualrcfetondum is the worst (Hear, hear.) It meant that the verdict of the people could be set aside if a majority, perhaps in the smaller States, was opposed to the will of the people that would be an abortive referendum in the face perhaps of an over whelming maturity of the whole people That proposition 1 strenuously resisted, and it was negatived Upon the position we are Unit the Adelaide Convention refused to make any provision for deadlocks EDUCATION ON THE DEADLOCK QUESTION To show the education to which the Convention must have been exposed between the Adelaide and Sydney conventions it is only necessary to say that in Sydney, instead of the matter being dismissed briefly, it was the chief subject of discussion, and innumerable propositions were made on the subject. I think about eight different proposals were made In the first place, Mr Symon copying the suggestion of Mr Wise at Adelaide, obtained a minority of 27 to 22 votes for his proposition Then Mr Lyne proposed an amendment that if the second dissolution did not prove effective there should bear tion of referendum, but it was negatived Then Sir George lad nor moved that the Executive should have shot of between a dissolution and a dual referendum Mr Wise moved an amendment on Sir George Turner s amendment to provide that in lieu of the first or second dissolution both Houses should be dissolved simultaneously That was adopted by 25 to 20 votes air Lyne then moved an amendment, that if the expedient of the simultaneous double dissolution failed there should be a national referendum That was negatived by 38 to 1 10 votes Then Sir George 1 liner's amendment as amended 1 by Mr Wise was put and defeated by 27 to 18 votes THE JOINT SITTING EMPLOIENT The joint Hitting as a means of settling deadlocks was proposed because there was a set determination against a national referendum Our position was that it was absolutely hopeless to get a national referendum, because the argument that it would cost a large amount of money to apply it over the enormous territory and scattered population of the Australian continent, as well as the inconvenience of it was held to be too serious to be con adored Thou Mr Carruthers moved his proposal for a joint wit a pig I according 1 that we could carry this if a majority *> three-fifths was allowed to prevail I confess I accepted it for the time I did not com- mit myself toil finally, but accepted it on a peg in the direction of settlement which would be infinitely better than successive dissolutions and a dual referendum When in Melbourne the final touches were being put to the bill I voted for a simple majority in the joint sitting, but the proposal was defeated by 27 votes to 16 votes The lo delegates who voted for the simple majority cou y spell of three from New South Wales and seven from a lemons Not one of the delegates of the smaller States voted to repeal the three-fifths majority Tiv e New South Wales and two Victorian representatives voted to retain the three-fifths majority They appear from all points to have been called, perhaps unjustly, the Conservative members of the New South Wales and Victorian delegations Mr HAYNES It is a true list of melancholy ex- expedients and fundamental errors The PREMIER It shows hon members that the ' Convention took a great deal of trouble to solve the difficulty. That there should be a dissolution of the thanks of Representatives alone or a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses and then a joint sitting was the Sydney settlement. At the Melbourne Cou vention the Sydney settlement was improved upon, and it was decided there should be one double dissolution, and then, if necessary, a joint sitting I have given this sketch to show that the matter was thoroughly defeated by the Convention But if instead of the composition as it was, it had been constituted with some regard to the population of the different colonies;, we would not now have to ask for the abolition of the three fifths majority An Hon Member Then you would not have got a constitution (Hear, hear ) The PREMIER That is quite true, and it is the only reason why I accepted it We all accepted equal representation in the Smoke simply two fuse there was no possibility of federation without it (Hear, hear.) It will not do for anybody to say that equal representation is the unfailing mark of federation It is nothing of the kind It is not the attitude of the German or the only British confede- ration we know In Canada one State has 21 sena- tors, another 24, and the other six have JJ between them Mr WISE No That is to say, I do not dispute your figures, but I do dispute your inferences The PREMIER The Dominion is arranged in three different parts, and an equal number given to each but the effect of that is that I stated, that six independent provinces before the union have only 33 senators in the union and two independent provinces before the union have 18 senators If that makes a similar case to the one which exists in tins draft bill perhaps my hon friend will give in Allow New South Wales and Victoria to have 24 senators and the other three 33 Mr EWING In every federation in the world there are greater inequalities than are proposed in the Federal Bill here The PREMIER Not every one to emphasise the case of Canada I might point out that the two larger provinces have 48 senators The six other provinces with a population of only 1,200,000 souls have it senators In our case the two States with 2,100,000 people have 12 and the three smaller States with 700,000 people live 18 senators How that ( in be Sold to have a similar adjustment to the Canadian system requires an amount of explanation. If it is the same thing, give it to us, and there will be no further trouble Mr HAYNES What are these State interests í The PREMIER That is the difficult point I do not know what are the State interests I can see one of ores which cannot be brushed aside, and that is that when the smaller States gives up its independence it wants to take a guarantee against being overwhelmed by the larger ones That is a proper footing, and unless you regard it to a certain extent it is simply idle to talk of federation at the present time I have always been prepared to accept the doctrine of equal representation, but always with the qualification that there should be in the constitution some sort of recognition that in the last resort the will of the nation should prevail (Hear, hear) The Convention tried to come up to that point without entirely surrendering the independence of the smaller States I think if we yield equal representation, if we condemn the possible 20 millions of this country (New South Wales) to any greater surrender in the House of Parliament than tasmania makes, there should in some part of the constitution be at least a provision that in any great national crisis the will of the people should have play I do not think, as I am at present advised that the people of New South Wales will accept this provision as to the joint sitting in its present shape, because we have to turn back on the smaller colonies the same argument which they force on us, and so since we have accepted equal representation, because without it there can be no federation, we ask you to accept this simple majority in a joint sitting The hon member for Ashfield, Mr Speaker, on the question of equal representation in the Senate, I think, with reference to the Act which constituted the Dominion of Canada, will find that he has arrived at a very erroneous conclusion I observe in the preamble of that Act that the provinces uniting were the province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick Mr MOORE Not Canada The PREMIER I hope the Imperial statute is not wrong It is an Act for the union of Canada Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and of the Governments thereof, and when we come to the Senile we find that the province of Canada for the purpose of senatorial representation was divided into two, and each got 24 senators Mr WISE The two provinces were under one Government. The PREMIER They were originally two, then they united, and for the purpose of the Senate they were dissevered The province of Canada was divided into two, forming the provinces of Ontario and Quebec There were 72 senators in all established by this Act, and the province of Canada, is it stood before the severance, got 18 By dividing it into two it is 24, and Nova Scotia and New BY Bruswick were put together to get 21 each So that if we put mod a similar process we should not be dissatisfied If we divided New South Wales would give us 12 Put South Australia and Tasmania together and give them 12, wait a considerable change would take place in the basis of senatorial representation The fact remains that, although several provinces have since been added in Canada, the number of senators has only increased from 72 to 81 So that in Canada there is nothing of equal State representation Of the three States that joined one got 48, and the other two between them got 24 They were united in order to get the 21 The first was divided in order to get 48 That is an absolutely different process from that which is proposed in this bill I do not want to go into a number of observations in order to show the importance of Una matter but I simply want to show what might happen under this provision for a three-fifths majority, in order to show that the matter is one of serious import At the joint sitting we may say assume after a terrible political struggle that every man will be in his place It will be an extraordinary accident that will prevent one of the 91 from being present. A majority sufficient to carry a measure after an appeal to the country must consist of 57 That is to say, there must be a division of 67 to 37 If the division was 56 to 38 the bill would fail, and the votes of the 38 would be stronger than the votes of the 55 Now, if the two Houses were at issue, putting again the closest division you can in the s"enate, there would be 16 to 11 lake the IG from the 38, and you get 22 Take 14 from the 56, and you get 12 And thus a hen you come to deal with the votes of the representatives ofthepeoule you find 22 eau block the will of the 42 representatives of the Australian people Mr M'LAUGHLIN Almost two to one majority the PREMIER And as each member would represent 0,00. souls this difference of 20 would represent a difference of 1,000,000 people The result would be this that after an appeal to the doctors of the Commonwealth. those who represented 1,100,000 Austrihana might prevail over those who were returned representing 2 100,000 Australian; Now, that is no trifling discrepancy it is a matter of serious consequence, and in view of the value attached by Australians to their political rights, and especially to the equal distribution of the franchise, no one can wonder that the people of this colony keenly resented a poor man of that sort I in the resolution no do not come forward and say to our fellow Australian country men, We insist on this solution of the difficulty " On the contrary, I think that this House will be perfectly prepared, and perhaps better satisfied, if the other colonies would agree to an exchange from the joint sitting to a national referendum I fancy we would be perfectly proper ed to accept, and probably more cheerful to accept, it than the joint sitting with the simple majority So that as far as we are concerned we are quite prepared to accept either one or the other THE BRADDON CLAUSE Now, the next point, Mr Speaker, is one upon which there will be less difference of opinion than on mi) other that is, as to the 87th clause The clause provides that of the net revenue from duties on customs and (excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure This is admitted by almost over) critic to be a mistaken provision One of the absurdities of the provision is that it is perpetual And if at any time in the financial exigencies of the Commonwealth the Treasurer desires to raise an additional sum from customs and excise it will be necessary for him to submit proposals calculated to produce one million sterling Mr COPELAND That is if all the revenue came from customs The PREMIER Chavasse Of course, the hon member will see that in that aspect of the matter we are not disappointed One of the effects might be that it would force a In insurer to resort to direct taxation and perlin- s direct taxation of no expensive and clumsy kind to raise a very small sum of money Would it not be absurd to apply direct taxation to produce £100,000 short in the Commonwealth revenue The Treasurer would be compelled to resort to a system of direct taxation which would apply all over the continent, or else he would be compelled to raise the sum of £500 000 in order to cover his £100 000 Of course we all know that the provision w ill not put in for the purpose of produc- ing so absurd a result In Adelaide the treasurers of the other colonies were anxious to have some sort of guarantee in the constitution which would protect them from the consequences of handing over there customs revenue without an) possible control over the question of the amount which they would receive in return that difficulty was not in this way There was a provision put in the will that the Commonwealth Treasurer should return to ever) State an amount equal to the customs rev sure of that State for the year prior to the uniform tariff, that is to say, the last year of the independent tariff of each colony I strongly objected to the solution and in the finance committee in Melbourne we were able to remedy it In our Scheme this Braddon clause had no sort of countenance Unfortunately at tho close of the sitting I am afraid by some prior arrangement-it was sprung upon the Convention by Sir Edward Braddon Mr WISE He gave notice of it a fortnight before on the business-paper The PREMIER Well, this exponent was brought up, and the simple effect of it was this The revenue of the Commonwealth was estimated at something like £15,050,000 that would mean pro- j hardly a customs revenue of £6 200,000, because a customs revenue of that amount would be required to fulfil the conditions of this class that is to say, pay the Commonwealth £lo,0o0 000 and pay the States then share of that amount I do not think I need dwell at any further length on that clause THE FEDERAL CAPITAL Joe I come to a clause which no doubt to some may have the appearance, not of a patriotic federal desire but of a comparatively selfish demand A eil, I justify taking up this matter in this way As the matter stands in the federal union it is covered by this bill, and I feel that the rightful and just claim of New South Wales in this respect has not proper and fair chance of being recognised unless the matter is taken up in this way I confess that taking the colonies without Queensland sa get an artificial centre-a centre which would undoubtedly be a most convenient centre for those taking part in that particular federation, but which would be an absolutely false centre with reference to the future of this continent and the future of the federation But with Queensland the true centre of the future nation must be on the eastern so aboard (Hear, hear ) i there is not the slightest doubt that the true centre of the future Commonwealth is on the eastern sea board, and is in New South Wales (Cheers.) Now I can advance several other reasons besides that This is the most populous colony This colony will produce and contribute to the CouitDonwenlth by far . the largest share of taxation And the incidental effects of the adoption of federation by this colony must involve larger sacrifices to this colony than in the case of any other Aus- ralian colony Speaking of trade and commercial intercourse, there is not the slightest doubt that federation will annex a large province of New South Wales to the sister colonies Nothing in the world under federation can prevent a large slice of the Riverina commerce going under the control of Victoria They have it already, but they have no guarantee of it They have it now under the freetrade tariff by the grace of the Parliament of New South Wales. Still, the difference between the tenure of the Riverina trade which Victoria has now and the commercial tenure of the trade which Victoria ought to have, and which that colony will have under federation, is most aubst lUhal And the same argument applies to the huge slice of our territory on the border of South Australia, and, a Queensland home, to the large slice of territory on the borders of Queensland An Hon Monitor Why not fix it in the bill that they are not to take that trade ' The PREMIER That is one of the sacrifices we are all prepared to make in the name of federation, and in order to secure the benefits of Australian union There is no doubt whatever that one of the strongest inducements on the part of the other colonies to federate consists -in that fact And no straightforward man in these colonies would day it It strengthens their desire for federation, and it does not weaken ours We do not put this forward as an obstacle in the path of federation Nothing of the kind We admit that under federation a large slice t four territory will commercially belong to Victoria, and we say that as this is one of the incidental operations of federation, let another incidental operation take place and place the capital somewhere within the boundaries of New South Wales. (Cheers ) Of course, I quite admit it is possible this would be given generously without the slightest stimulation as a bargain I think we are entitled to ask for it I think it is a fair thing to ask (An hon member ' It ought to have been asked for before 1 P o bably it should have been asked before It has been suggested to me that we should go further, and ask that the capital should be in a certain place I am not prepared to take such an extreme view There a provision in the bill that the federal capital should be in " federal territory " I do not say it should not be in federal territory. Those words were inserted on the motion of Sir George Turner, in order to convince the people of New South Wales that he did not want to acquire the privilege of having the capital for a lotorne. They were put in to reassure the people of this colony I admit it is a very arguable point whether the territory should not be federal in the United States lim federal State is a despotism, the purple being absolutely under the President but I am told they are the best governed people iii to United States In Canada on the other hand, there was no stigma him in the Act of us ion that the capital should 1 beat demi territory, but they fixed the site of the central city in the Act c of union Ottawa is named in the Act of confederation, but Ottawa is not in general, but in provincial territory I do not think the slightest inconvenience has arisen in consequence As to whether the capital of the Commonwealth should be in federal territory or not that is a question which should be left to the Federal Parliament, It should not be stipulated in to s bill THE BOUND SERIES OF SI Al ES The next point is one I am sure there will not be the slightest doubt about it is for the protection of not this colony alone, but of every colony in the strong We propose to put thin S ato r it is to State boundaries under the sun procession as it affords d in regard to the representation, of' blister-, ea discovery State shall have preserved the i ted, ity all its boundaries as a State right THE RIVERS QUESTION Now take the rivers question There is no parallel in the other colonies with New South Wales in this matter. The Darling the Murrumbidgee, and the Lachland are astir ly in New South Wales that is that the whole course of thorn era is in New South Wales As to the Darling, the whole we watershed is not in New South Wales, but it is not in any of the other colonies, and the whole course IB in New South Wales There is an intercolonial law that, in the case of a river that rises and goes to the end of its course in the territory of one country, that country has an absolute right over it as against any other country The moment water flows through two or more count not the case is different, but as regards the Darling, the Murrumbidgee, and the Lachlan, those waters are our property as against all the other colonies A question might arise between Queensland and New South Wales as to the Darling, but not between Victoria and New South Wales, or South Australia and New South Wales These three rivers, for the purpose of of water conservation and irrigation, are in our colony, and are the most valuable possession which we have to day Vast tracts of our territory are absolutely dependent for most of their development upon the use of the water of those rivers We do not question the rights of the Commonwealth Parliament to preserve freedom of trade on these rivers We have sUggested them for the benefit of our intercolonial neighbours, to the injury of our own railways flint shows that we have not been animated by a selfish spirit in our intercourse with our neighbours But, unfortunately, where the Commonwealth has jurisdiction over a thing, and the State has jurisdiction over the same thing, the jurisdiction of the State must yield to that of the Commonwealth, and I do not see how we can alter that state of things Apply that to the case of the rivers These were run high and dry for weeks together they become uneasy ignoble in the future irrigation Wv ria may be established in New South Wales, to which a constant supply of water is necessary these in ors are approaching a point at which they may cease to be any age bro A question might easily arise that the irrigation works were interfering with the navigability of the rivers The only duty of the Commonwealth would be to see that the navigation laws would be preserved, because the Commonwealth would owe no duty to the e tale law on the matter of Irrigation That opens up all sorts of unsatisfactory considers tions i asked the Convention to affirm that nothing in the bill should abridge the right of New South Wales to the use of the waters of her rivers for the purposes I have mentioned Unfortunately, Sir John Downer earned an amendment that the word " reasonable " be inserted therefore, our rights, which are absolutely our own to-day, became subject to the interpretation of what is a " reasonable " use of the water. There might be a COnstant conten- tion that those who used the water for irrigation made the rivers unfit for navigation and that this was an '* unnameable " use at the water is day this colony can authorise the use of the water of these rivers to an unlimited extent but under the Commonwealth Bill it is questionable whether the could do so MONEY BILLS The question of money bills races one of the most important questions connected with federal ation Is the taxation of the people to be under the muster ship of one House or the trial in the United States there are two matters if the public purse, and enormous abuses li iva resulted therefrom in Eng land and the self-governing colonies the House which represents the people is roster of the public purse Mr Gilli I ITH Hero both Houses represent the taxpayers The PREMIER One House represents the people as a nation, and the other Houseroproicutslheiu in a different capacity You have the choice of putting the burden of the State on a State basis or on a national basis If you put the incidence of taxation on a State basis, then each State would contribute an equal amount to the exchequer If you put the incidence of taxation on a national basis one State might contribute one and a half millions and another State not more than a '00 DOO to the cache pier Yet the taxpayers of the £200 000 would have the same representation as the taxpayers of the one and a half million You have the choice of a State system of finance, which lively as an equal contribution from each Mate ora minors! system, which taxes the human beings in the nation and what I say is that if you have the national area and evidence of lava tion You should nationalise the mode of dealing with it (Hear, hear ) On this point he should have a uniform practice in ant of uniformity over this question will only multiply the possibility of confusion The beauties cannot amend it bill for the ordinary annual services of the State but a loan till they came bill for any services other than the ordinary annual services they can Only consider what questions and what disputes may arise If a bill is sent to the Senate, and it contains one item which the Senate considers beyond the definition of the an usual services, in the defence of its rights and privileges the Senate might feel it incumbent upon it to throw it out, on the ground that it broke the constitution and included services which ought not to be include in the measure 1 these difficulties do not appear to the popular imagination, but they are serious, and may lead to a great deal of disorder standing I would like to make the practice in the case of all money bills uniform uniform in the house that they should not be amended by the Senate, because of financial I ills of any kind are to be of open to the ordinary tie fitment of amendment in the second Chamber, as a financial basis and control in the Lower House are gone (Hear, hear) CAUSE OF ENGLAND'S FINANCIAL STRENGTH One of the best attributes of the British system of government to-day in the admirable st ability of the public finances, and that admirable stability, v high is the envy of the whole w and, is mainly to be even buted to the fact that the finances are shaped absolutely in one Chamber THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA With reference to the judicial appeal, I may state that in the bill as framed at Adelaide there was a clause expressly framed prohibiting aj peals from the Courts of the States to the Privy Council! that clause was. removed in Melbourne, and as the bill now stands the plaintiff in an action could appeal to the Privy Council, whilst the defendant could appeal to the High Court of Australia. The bill in that respect requires amendment Unless this High Court of Australia is to be a final court for private appeal, with a reservation that there shall has the right of appeal to the Queen in certain cases, then the position is not a sound one If it was seen by berltujcsty's advisers that the High Court was establishing a principle of law of a pernicious character, then her Majesty should have the power to take the case to the Privy Council in order to set the Hi 5th Court right I say that if the High Court is not to be a High Court of Apps in for private litigation, then it should have nothing to do with private litigation, because the more you multiply the means of litigation the worse it is for those who live to pay for it, and especially for those who could not afford it ran financial clauses The third clause of the resolutions is one I thought I should submit to this House In Melbourne I was the chairman of the finance committee I quite admit that on all the information we could command, and the consideration no could give to the subject, the Behera who presented to the Convention, and which was adopted, was perhaps the best we could frame, but it is impossible for anyone since then to have thoroughly considered this matter ill all its bearings without seeing that there are some doubtful points about it. In the first place there is a want of certainty, which would place the finances of the different colonies in a most unfortunate position I endeavoured to retain a clause in the bill which would give an element of certainty, for the first five j ears at any rate, b> limiting the expenditure of the Cominoiiwi till within a definite amount I confess that as ma ters now stand the point is not an enviable one I was very much astonished by a criticism made on certain words in the Convention Bill during the recent campaign on the bill in Tasmania The bill provides that after five years have elapsed the sur I ins should be distributed under a method which the Commonwealth deems fair the object was not to deprave a colony of the money to which it was entitled, but to enable the Commonwealth Parliament by the light of five years' experience, to apply the same rule which had previously been applied if it proved to be a fair rule But in Tas mania sir Philip Fysh and Mr Johnston (the Government Statist of the colony) made use of these words as meaning that after five years had elapsed the Commonwealth would open any one while it liked to the distribution of the surplus 1 hint was not intended by the Finance Committee or the Cow von tion NEW SOUTH WALES SHOULD MAKE A SACRIFICE So far as I am concerned I think it would be well for us in New South Wales to make a sacrifice in order to secure simplicity and certainty in the Commonwealth finances (Hear, hear ) I do not intrude such a proposal in the resolutions, because I do not wish to have the appearance of off and in a patronising way assistance to States which perhaps are not so strong in their resources as we are to day I think I will have the support of this Assembly in being prepared to make reasonable financial sacrifices if they will bring about, to a reasonable extent, the element of simplicity and certainty in dealing with the finances As the bill stands I do feel that since we have come into this matter again we should exhaust our opportunities in endeavouring to find a better financial scheme than the one in the bill AN IMPORTANT ASSURANCE TO THE OTHER COLONIES At the same time it is a serious undertaking to / deal with that part of the bill and I wish to give this assurance to the other colonies that if, as the result of the boat inquiries we can make, it is impossible to substantially improve of the financial scheme, that for the sake of union we will not make that a ground for a reef veal to federate Opposition cheers ) I told Una aspect of the federal problem so difficult that I enables 1 it my duty to pay of the matter before people of New South Wales Having in side the people conversant with the west- ing of the financial scheme I not say that if it is impossible to get any of mg better we ought to sweep it, and it Now south Wales can make the problem (Miner b) any act of liberality I am prepared to take that course Mr CRUICKSHANK What about federating the public debts and ruin says ' UlieFIlFMlIi.R That is a great feature in the proper n, did it not have to be taken up and considered .

In that gentleman's public utterances I am very Glad to observe that Mr. Byrnes is desirous of bringing Queensland into line with the other Aus- trading colonies from list to last it has seemed to me a national misfortune that Queens- land was not fully represented in the Convention, and is to day not abreast of the colonies in the path towards federal union (Cheers ) I feel convinced from that which I know that there is the highest probability of Queensland taking an earnest and practical just in joining the various colonies in the act of toilet ii um n Of course, it would be peculiarly great trying to us in New South Wales if that should be pro-, ed to be the case (Cheers ) 1; cannot conceive of any Australian who does not see that a le Petition would be but a mutilated federa- tion unless it is eluded one of the greatest and most promising colonies on the continent (Hear, hear ) THE tiLGISLATnE COUNCIL AND THE RESOLUTIONS Mr WISE Do you propose to introduce these resolutions into the Legislative Council 1 The PREMIER Certainly Mr WISE Under the care of Mr Want?

At the same time if the other Chamber were ignored, the first thing that would be said would be that I was endeavouring to foment a constitutional quarrel between the two Houses in order to shipwreck feller tion Mr ASHTON They would have to agree to the resolutions in the same form The PREMIER That is a little ahead of laughter ) THE PREMIER CONCLUDES Now, Mr Speaker, I must apologise to the House for the time which has been taken up in making this explanatory statement (No, no ) I felt it was a matter of very great importance upon which I could not be too explicit, and Upon feel prepared to leave these results tions in the hands of hon members I know observations bay of been made as to the conciliator) form in which they are couched and references have been made to episodes of the recent political ciiiipni(,n Well, I am not ashamed to confess that when the political battle is rising, I as a fighting man and I do my best to return blow for blow with those who endeavour to bring about my destruction There is no doubt that in the thick of the Ray) do not always conduct myself with the dignity and propriety which a man can preserve when he is firing at you from behind the editorial hedge (Laughter.)

He would allow all the latitude he could, but he was afraid that the resolution could not be taken both as a whole and seriatim The House would have to decide what it would do The PREMIER suggested that hon,,, members would not desire to make two long speeches If they spoke when the resolutions were put as a whole they would not speak when the matters came up sometime At the latter stage they would have the opportunity of proposing amendments He thought the resolutions c may be debated as a whole, and then it would be for the Government to put the matter in such a shape that hon members could move amen J mounts The MINISTER FOR WORKS suggested that the Speaker had power to allow great latitude. Mr COPELAND said he would suggest that the debate be adjourned until Wednesday next. The PREMIER said he was in the hands at the House in the matter. He had heard that Mr. Lyne was ill. He had no objection to the aiijonrtunent. Mr. COPELAND moved,-" That the debate be adjourned" The motion was agreed to. The PREMIER moved,-"That the consideration of the resolutions be made an order of the day for Wednesday next." The motion was agreed to.
