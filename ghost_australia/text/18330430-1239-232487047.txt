Errors of the Day.—The devoutest believers in 'the march of intellect' must at intervals be almost driven to renounce their creed in de- spair. Errors which were supposed to have been exploded centuries ago, sometimes reap- pear on a sudden, and propagate themselves for a season with a rapidity which no reason- ing can pursue, no ridicule arrest. Notions, worthy only of the dark ages, spring up in the glare of the supposed illumination of the pre- sent day, and resist all the efforts of the Bria- rean press itself to dispel them. At one time, it is a pious Hungarian prince who performs preternatural cures, at the request of the friends of the sick parties in Ireland, convey- ed through that droll medium for a miracle, the Hamburgh letter bag! At another, it is an old dropsical impostor, whom thousands of blaspheming dupes venerate. A short time since animal magnetism was in vogue; and the strong will of certain gifted individuals was believed to have the power of entering into a mystical communication with the spirits of others, and of absolutely controlling their whole physical and mental being! To-day we are startled by the actual exhibition of a mira- cle, the 'unknown tongue,' on alternate Sun- days, at the Caledonian chapel in Regent square, London ! If at any time we are tempt- ed to plume ourselves on the fact, that the be- lief in ghosts and witchcraft has disappeared, we are humiliated by the recollection that there are yet thousands of devout believers in the prophecies of Francis Moore, physician ; or by overhearing the rhapsodies of some mil- lenarian dreamer, who as confidently gives us the date of the opening of the New Jerusalem as if he were speaking of the new London Bridge.—Quarterly Rev.
