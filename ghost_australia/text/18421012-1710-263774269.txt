A CURIOUS LETTER ^ROM A MAN WITH A CURIOUS NAME: s, Jam satis.. terrjs, nivis atque dir<B Grandinis misit, Fum Fa et rubente Dextra sacras'jaculatus arces Now quite enough of rain and hail Mighty fum fa hath sent, To make the world around him quail. And wicked men repent. But most of- all that " little bug" That bit his ar—^m so sore, And when he thought he'd got him snug! Bit harder than before. Sir,—My friend "Billy Polecat"* and me have long ago come to the Conclusion that he and me together are a match for the world:—there was once a trio of uisj a fellow by the name o^ " Cimex " and a regular Inimbug he was, whom we tried to keep with us, we hardly know wliy^—Butwe thought it convenient to be friendly with him on the same principle that a man in the cage of a.bear or any other noxious' and disagreeable, althougli contemptible- animal or reptile would 1 be enclined rather to conciliate than irritate the beast. We kept him a long time with his head under water, but lie was amphibious and Would not give up the ghost and bis skull was so thick that r it was of no use to try to knock. him on the head \ so " Billy " was obliged to become his keeper and what with soothing syrup that he poUred into his ear and now arid then putting my missis's flannel .petticoat into his mouth as a gag, we managed to keep thb " Voice or the "Vox" as some people caU it, J»retty quiet. Oh, sir, " Billy " Is such a clever fellow ; but, nevertheless, the other was too many for us'—he bolted one day when our eye Was*nt upon him and although I cried "fum fa," and "stop thief" after him as loud as I could» his legs Were longest and h6 got away. To be sure, it was tery silly to make such a fuss about so inconsiderable and insignificant a person and I cannot think how Billy and me came to be so foolish as to take any notice of it» - Well, Sir, Billy and me are now two, n & ^ s a ^ ^ y e f t o impose my missfe as my lawful wife on Governor Gawler, and Ue found me out, and ever/siiice! Ijwo^ed ^r^ little giii for saying^!? was her- fedier, I^Jiiev^r 1 found a nicer fellow or one inore lito j iny liking. He beats lier\«f meut" io s^ick. tc^&er; closer thanBUIy lent '^e '"^bften ^hair not a p&iyjj; of his,ov^ in his pocket, yet he is quite as generous with-it, if he has any, although it may belong to other people^ ~ tte distinguished himself by his scribbling propensities in England, and the fame he acquired by the use, of his pen in one of the Southern Counties made; him so much sought after, that he was obliged to leave his- native land merely to avoid the importunity of those \vh° desired- to seek a closer, acquaintance with - him. j W« are determined, Sir, to Make the ground, shake and x tremble under us, if you will but allow -us , become ^negu-> lar correspondents pf your papers AH your contemporaries shall melt like was before us,-if "you wil] allow us to take ap ' the cudgels -for you, and a green sickness shall ,take hold o£ Goveruor Grey, We used to writer great deal, sand-if it 3iad not been for * that, same- " Gimex^' or e "poor bug'* we should-still stand A vdie poloi^in^teadf: of ^jeiug^flaid up as condemned: liulks up the fiver* The inagip of my " fuip fas " and any table spoons which I used to pawn to buy grog to IU^iiia^ffly ®c«idlej without : ^bich j j ^ m d ; ( f & r I cannot Jp^il I am- • that the risrdrla I'ad^^'jicf^ sten|^«till. v Th« spirit. ^^iuspl^on^-^atlldie vulgar people called are .said /to draw from Fam^ssus^I ; ; Billy - draw from Danielr^^^Q^^II^'i^^ih'o -supplies 5 Us wiffi a glass.

"... ; :.fhat":our lucid and inimitable lucubrations, that are wont fo"restore ".harmony to uproar", beam forth like the sun frona beneath a cleud to reanimate the dull world of scandal in Adelaide, give a gist to back- biting, make glad the hearts of "the flakes who lurk in the grass", and .even the frogs-, croak..from..under. the very stumps of the trees. \ The breath • of :calumny;: has never, attempted, ^tor' injure/ ^iUy'' and me, except about going, to Governor Gawler's Levee, beating the child whose father nobody knows, but her mother and I, the affair that made Billy so much sougiiSt^after at home, and. may be, one or two li ? .tle peccadilloes .besides, since he came here, not worth mentioning, and which peoples are beginning . to, forget. Therefore, in recommending myself, or as it will be in fact, ourselves to you, Billy and me may state ourselves to. b| unblemished character^. I have a feipirkable knack of making people think me to be a paragon iSlinodesty and honori and really to look at me^ one would: think butter would not melt in my hiouth. Billy too, is as specious and plausible a man as you can Ij.ere and there meet with, until about six in the evening) \Vhen he always experiences an attack . of a periodical infirmity that paralyses his tongue, fixes his eyes in., vacaucj', and renders his legs almost useless. ' Sometimes indeed, this sad visitation comes on earlier in the day, and continues occasionally for days together* I jaayself, since {we have been iutupate, li^ye ^ad,severe attacks of this complaint; arid, although I must admit having had frequent toucfees of it before, yet I think it has been" exaggerated by sympathy* To conclude, Sir, if you will allow me to write for you I will realise the motto of Julius C«esar, "veni, vidi, rici," wliicli I trahslaib, " Ye iesSer stars hide your diminished heads."
