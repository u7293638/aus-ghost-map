flip Romance of a Cathedral. The. tom'Ist who rather wearily ''does'' the English7:cathedrals hears very-little of-theslegends . and' quaint stories, the fun and^pathns associated with'the buildings; so it-is;vainer a treat'to stroll ? through Lincoln Cathedral-via the "Temple Ma-j gazine," and to .read how stone».may disappear. . .When William 'the Norman presented his relative, Remigius with the bishopric in 1067, that prelate found the* whole of- it in a state.; of disorganisa tion. -,, :; .> . Remigius had ; a passion f T . building,--and determined to erect a cathedral the like bf which Had, never been,seen in England be fore.'- He wished toiichange the headquarters of the see; and he, therefore, chose - Stowe,' which had been the head of the diocese previous to Dor chester. The Bishop decided to rebuild'the old church that had been f unded in honor .of St. Etheldreda and destroyed by the Danes._ Builders got to work, but what they accomplished in .the : day was pulled down,fitaüg^,^and±he3tfflnesawere ^carj^dÄway.;',i;3^saa»^ irsun^l^he¿4BislK>pi^^ it -was 'no^use-îtrying^to, build ,there-longer. ? The stones . were found r n the top of the hill at Lincoln, so he took- that: circumstance as a sign that his church was to be built there. . Stowe . waa left, in au unfinished state, and , the : edifice now standing was begun. < ' "The- story and figure of an.imp got mixed up with 'the beautiful carving. in the: angels' choir, and explains tr»-a' . puzzled stranger how it-is said "the ; devil watches over Lincoln." "One day, the wind' in its wanderings paid-, a visit to Lincoln to see howthe new . part of the minster was getting on. The wind was accompanied [.'by two 'imps, who*were both impressed with . the-grandeur and beauty pf everything they saw. ' One of them, determined to go inside, and see what was happen ing thçre: ' His curiosity cost, him dear; he was.so awed and astonished at the loveliness of all around him that he ? turned to stone, * though not before taking up his abode in the most beautiful part? of. the building. .' The other imp .waited-in vain for his bro ther,- .and flew, round and round-, not daring " to ' go inside. Tired out : at last.'he seated himself on the 'shoul-: ders of a witch, and was likewise turri ? ed to stone. ,. The latter imp may be seen lust outside the south porch on ' the.1' witch's back,' and.; from this fact . - arose -.- the " saying that 'the . devil .always : watches . over >r Lincoln:' " .
