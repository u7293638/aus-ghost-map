NO SATISFACTION WITHOUT HOLINESS. To the regenerate man there is nothing so lovely, there is nothing so winning, there is nothing so precious as goodness, as holiness. Ah, how He admires it in the angels. And how; he admires it whenever he sees it in his iellow- Ohristian ! How attractive it is ! how winning ! How it captivates his heart 1 how it excites his desires ! how it inspires his aspirations to be holy ! how he hungers and thirsts after righteousness in its fullest fruition I How his heart pants after God 1 how his very nature cries out for the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ! He oannot be satisfied until he realizes it, any more than a famishing man can be satisfied without food and drink. It is a hunger and thirst ; it is the hunger of the soul, the thirst of the spirit. It cannot be satisfied without a realization of the good it craves. It is a new need created by his conversion, and he must have it satisfied or he cannot be at perfect peace. His heart, his soul, ories out for the nature and image of God! His soul is continually saying, 'Ah, who that loves can love enough ?' Can we realize this full salvation ? Is it attainable here and now ? Can we be made perfect in love? May we be ' strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power?' May we be strong in the Lord and the power of His might ? - Yes, for He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think acoording to the power that worketh in us. ' Glory be to the (Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. Amen.'
