KAPUNDA COURSING. rRvTfllprrrnnh.l Kanunda, June 2S. The Ivapunda Coursing Ulubs meeting began to-day on the Anlaby Estate. The weather was overcast and very cold, but 300 or 400 persons drove out to the scene of the meeting. uunng sne morning game was so scarce that only half a dozen trials were decided before lnnoh, but afterwards things improved, and twenty-one courses were run off before dark. The ground where most of the trials took place was full of timber, aud conse quently somo of tlio results were unsatis factory. Mr. Hope, tho Judge, kept very close to his dogs, and gave every satisfaction. Tho favourites on Monday night, Ruby and Juno, meet in the next round, when one of them must go out. Tom Harrington was badly cut in his course, and will probably be drawn. The slipping was particularly gond, but tho crowd proved rather unmanageable. Results :- ANLAIJY STAKE.
