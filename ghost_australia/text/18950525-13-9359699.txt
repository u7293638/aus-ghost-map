ART NOTES. AT A " LIFE CLASS." BY CRAYON. Let us pass through the door of the statue gallery at the Public Library, and close it behind us so that we may not disturb that Greek slave yonder, waiting for the new master who will never come. Now we are in the gallery "For Students Only," and a girl working there by herself under the gas-jets looks up from her easel with a startled glance —she is copying the torso of a Hercules. How puny the men of to-day must seem to her in comparison with the thews and sinews of Deianeira's mighty husband. Pass- ing quickly down through the white ghosts of these departed heroes we reach another door, but the glass panes are jealously frosted, for Lady Godiva often spends an hour or two in there, and the race of Peeping Toms is not confined to Coventry. To-night, however the model happens to be a man, a well-built young fellow of five or six and twenty, who earns a modest wage nightly by posing for the class, which is under the direc- tion of Mr. F. McCubbin. The model stands on a raised platform, motionless as a statue, in the attitude directed, the right foot drawn back slightly behind the left, the arms thrown forward, and the strong brown hands grasping a rake, for he is posing as a gardener. The cluster of gas jets overhead is so shaded as to throw a strong light on the figure, while the students —half a-dozen or so in number—stand round with their easels ranged in a semicircle. As one passes along the line of easels one sees the model reproduced in charcoal from every point of view, and there is infinite variety of light, shade, and colour in this simple pose, from the high bright tone where the gaslight strikes full on the forehead to the blue-black shallows on the back and the purple rim that defines the outline of the solidly-planted outside foot Presently someone calls " Rest," and the silence that has hitherto prevailed is dispelled. The model steps from his platform, and non- chalantly lights a cigarette as he sits on a handy little railing swinging his legs. He does not bother even to throw a cloak over his shoulders, for the temperature of the room is kept up to a comfortable height ex- pressly for his benefit. As for the students, they lay down their bits of charcoal, turn from their easels, and plunge at once into that queerest of all dialects, the "shop" of the studio. They will rest for five minutes now, and then the model will pose again for another 20 minutes. Host of these students are young, but being >oung tiny aro also earnest , and in art earnestness is everything " Continue, con tinne," as lludyard Kiplings old Trench drawingmaater used to say in dhcLi/ht J hal Vailed, " but alwaja with conviction Many of the stueiirs aro capitally done, nnd j ct in glancing o\er them one feels that it is pos sihle for a Btudent even to be too earnest It must bo a thankless task certainly to ha\e to hide ones anatomical knowledge under a bushel just because the model lins neglected the dumbbells, and so one must sympathise withtliedrauglitsmanwhoenlows that rather slim and wiry young fellow with the forearm of " Pompadour Jim ' and the shoulders of Professor Miller Lowell points out, in review mg Swinburne s tragedies that a profusion of imagery is at once the defect anti com pensation of all youthful poetry, even of Shakespeare s Ile declares that, although it Boem8 a paradox to say it, there can be toomuch poetry in a poem.

Her limbs arc crossed one o\er the other, and the sole of one dainty foot is turned towards the class.
