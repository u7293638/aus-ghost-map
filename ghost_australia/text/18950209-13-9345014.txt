THE JANUARY MAGAZINES. No. I. Professor M'Neill, Q.C., the nationalist member for South Donegal, communicates to the Fortnightly Review a short and easy a method which he professes to have discovered, in his studies of constitutional law and history, of neutralising the leg slative power of the House of Lords A new writ of summons is issued, he says, by the Crown, on the advice of its responsible Ministers, to every peer, except Scotch representative ones, at the commencement of each Parliament, which he presents at the table of the House of Lords before taking and subscribing the oath required by law nor can (t peer exercise his functions until this writ of summons has been issued, to which, it is argued, he is not necessarily entitled Therefore, he contends, it is only necessary for the Lord Chancellor to refrain from sum meeting such peers as are known to be hostile to a dissolution of the Empire, in order to " render the Second Chamber a consultative and revising body, in a stead of a danger to the Consti- tution," which is Professor M'Neill's euphemistic method of describing a House of Lords, which would be a mere court of record for the House of Commons Mr C B R Kent, discussing the question of a Second Chamber from an opposite point of view, exposes the fallaciousness of the state courts which are made with respect to the obstructiveness and irresponsibility of the House of Lords, showing that they are based upon imperfect generalisation and a false inductive process The examines the bills which have been mutilated" or rejected since 1882, and shows that, in none of these has um resistance of the declared wishes of the people been really in volved. So far from the Upper House having been a reactionary or retrogressive body, Mr Event adduces numerous proofs that " the other House has so far belied its represents a character as to have frequently assumed an altitude of determined opposition to many measures of an enlightened and really useful kind It has often slammed the door in the face of those reformers whose efforts, now that they have been eventually crowned with success, meet with the almost unanimous approval of the nation So that we are almost driven to the conclusion that, from 1892 to na late at least as 1807, the Lower House either was not truly representative at all, or that, if it was representative, it flagrantly) refused to reflect the wishes of the people The repeal of the Corn Laws is cited as a striking case in point, for it required about fifteen years of fervid agitation in order to over come the obstructive position taken up by the House of Commons on a question affecting the very sustenance of the people, and the salvation of the great manufacturing industries of the United Kingdom from bank ruptcy and ruin The restriction by law of alien immigration, as proposed by Lord Saint bury, Mr Chamberlain, and the Norwich Trade Union Congress, finds a vigorous opponent in Mr O Drage, who shows from the Board of Trade returns that, so far as Great Britain is concerned, the in flux of aliens is both absolutely and relatively insignificant, as it was only 12,000 m IS'Jl and 0,000 in 1893, while the total emigration in those years was 118 090 and 109,090 respectively. As to the Russian and Polish Jews, so far from having displaced native labour they have treated it new trade, time introduced a better system of organisa- tion, are making an opening for successful competition w Uli German) in the fabrication of wearing apparel, and earn remunerative wages At the same time, the writer acknowledges that the question of alien mum gration stands upon an entirely different footing in Australia, neighbours as we are by two empires which contain very near!) three-fourths of the total population of the world. On the subject of the French occupation of Madagascar, the well informed writer who signs himself " Vazaha " argues that his both the duty and interest of Great Britain to give France a free hand in that island, and to be loyal to the Anglo- 1 reach treaty) or agreement, which originated with Earl Granville, and was signed, sealed, and delivered by the Marquis of Salisbury Mr Skelton's reminiscences of the late J A Froude, which are brought to a conclusion in the present number of Fleetwood, more than sustain the interest excited by the former instalment The letters of the deceased historian, written with the most complete unreserve, admit us into the private reflections and mature conclusions of an original thinker an 1 philosophical observer upon the foremost public men of his day, and what he believed to be the perilous drift of current events He speaks in one of the " immense Parliamentary dexterity ' of Mr Gladstone, and records his conviction that "in lift) y cars or sooner a vulgar Caesar will be the outcome of it " He considered Lord Beaconsfield to be "the only English starts man who knew anything about Ireland and wrote very scornfully of Parliamentary m stitutioiiB and party government "In the rigging of parties at Westminster " he observed, "the welfare of the country is the last matter that any body thinks about Some day or other the country will find this out and will wring the necks of thePurhamentar) vermin But it will be a longdnyyet John Bull will be an attenuated animal when the fever leaves him, with bare!) strength to do justice to his misleads " Sharing in his friend Carblc's vehement antipathy to government by palaver, ' Troudo evidently) thought the mother country was approaching a great crisis, and wrote to Mr Skelton in 1884 - "We are to drink the cup of the Louis fury to the bottom But when the drunken fit is over and we are sick and sorry again, amidst the fragments of a ruined i empire, it will remain to show that Carlyle was a true seer Froude's letters written after his return from Australia, and while he was working up his notes into a book, show that his Cleans faithfully reflected his impressions of these colonies I am in the extraordinary position," in 3093, of having to speak nothing but well of everything and ever) body Having nobody to abusE, I am like trying to fly a kite without wind " And again, when speaking of our own side of the world he remarks, "Itis very much like this side except that it is warm and bright, and full of flowers and plums and peaches, and you never see a discontented face or a hungry one." A thrilling ghost story occupies nearly forty pages of the present number, and the usual place of the political article is occupied by some rule) comments on current events?, art exhibitions, and new books, by "The Looker on " in the Pall Mall Magazine, General Lord Roberts concludes his historical sketch of the rise of Wellington, and places his military genius in a brighter light than ever Napoleon, who encountered him for the first time at Waterloo, undervalued it, nndniadesurcof victory but boult knew better, and so did General Tore "These English," said the Marshal, " will die on the ground on which they stand before they will lose it," as they did, and Napoleon paid the bitter penalty of his own cocksureness and of his great opponents superior generalship Wellington's mag imminent) and moderation were shown by his inducing the allies to lower the indemnity) exacted from the French from SOO millions of francs to 240 millions Napoleon's petty malignity) was shown by his leaving 10,000 francs to the miscreant who endeavoured to assassinate Ina conqueror, and the money was actually paid to the In 1rs of the would be murderer by the Mau of Sedan in Paris, after the defeat at Waterloo, the Court, the Ministers, and the chief officers of the French Army blamed towards Wellington with a coldness which sometimes amounted to the court , but it elicited from him a Biircasm which Talleyrand himself might have envied On one occasion when the Duke was attend ing n hide, the marshals present hard) acknowledged his greetings, and after short interval walked away) from him in a body Louis XVIII had grace enough to apologise for this act of rudeness, whereupon Willing ton made the apt r( pi)," Your Majesty need not distress yourself It is not the first time they have turned their back H on mc Very) different was the conduct of the London populace to a brave enemy, for when Marshal Boult rode in the procession at the Queen's coronation the crowd cheered the white headed veteran enthusiastically from Hyde Park corner to Westminster Abbey The Colonia, a magazine published once a term by the students of the Colonial College, at Hollesley Bay, in Suffolk, offers a striking exemplification of the adventurous and colonising spirit of the British rare As a channel of communication between those who are preparing themselves to become settlers in all parts of the empire and those who have already dispersed themselves far and wide, it is a record of what both are doing Old collegians write back to their Alma Mater From Australia New /iealaml.Canada, South Africa, and the East and West Indies, as well as from the United States and South America, relating their experiences, and describing how they are prospering in their new career the tone of their letters is generally hopeful and confident The writers have been well equipped for the battle of life by their practical education, and they encounter its difficulties with Vue British pluck and determination '1 They do not belong to the class of men who loaf about the cities and large towns of the colonies and expect the Government to provide them with employment when occupation is scarce, but they reclaim the wilderness, found homes in solitary places, and are not afraid to rough it for a few years in order to acquire a future competence One vi rites from Hawke's Bay, N Z -'For the first year I worked as second shepherd for his keep, and have received wages from the end of my probation until now I am perfectly contented, as I am with the very best of good people in most then] they district, and (are gaining the right kind of experience daily ' Another at Renmark, SA, says -
