THE CYCLORAMA. The introduction of new features in the, entertainment given at the Cyolorama has caused this already attractive resort to become still more popular, and the attendance on Tuesday evening was very large. The picture of the " Battle of Waterloo" gains fresh inte rest with every inspection, and the illustrative lecture by Mr. Lockley intensifies the pleasurej of theonlookersinamarkeddegree. In addition to the illusion, the ghost of Napoleon, which is nightly on view, a novel and decidedly pretty feature has been added under the some what alarming title " Hydatapikilumina," or the enchanted fountains of laughing waters. This consists of a fountain whioh throws 500 jets to the height of 50 and 60 ft., the altitude of the water constantly changing and assum ing new shapes, which with the addition of colored lights has an indescribably beautiful effect. Tbe Cyclorama has hitherto amply repaid a visit, but with the additional attrac tions now offered there is little doubt that it will be still more extensively patronised in the future.
