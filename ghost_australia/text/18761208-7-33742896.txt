Now, ir this little pleasantry there is much truth, and it is one which ought to be more borne in mind than is the case in tine colony. Not the richest fields in the world wiU stand constant ex haustion with impunity. I look upon the districts between the Ibnas*itnn and j Melrof*, and out to the sea, as the very cream of ' the agricultural lands of this province—the j garden of South Australia; and tbose who have posseano?L of them should value them accordingly. I would, therefore, as a ward of parting warning to people for whom I have a regard, protest against the reckless system of husbandry being pursued in this magnificent region, which haa w thoroughly impoverished otiier lands in other dnfericto which were nearly, if not quite, as good, t have confidence in die continued growtk'and prosperity of tibe comgjpqy^ot one thing appears to me certain— ilirt JWW m? getting to the lknit of the land Width «a? bo cultivated witit proEt ihraogk consecutive yean.

The change in the character of the indigenous vegetation there seems to show a distinct climatic boundary, to the north of which, as they would approatm the rainless sane, I do not think that cereals will be able to bold their ground. I say, therefore, to those who now have the garden of this pcoviaoe, " take care of what yon have got, for if you exhaust this you cannot go farther afield f bat I assure yon that in whatever country I may be Z shall always watch with cordial and friendly interest the {future fortunes of these Northern Areas j (Loud cheers.) j Mr. H.

To complete the purchase of land on which the school is erected, plaster the walls, and fence in the ground, a farther sum of £200 will still be required. Abonfc >£85 will have to" be raised to pay oS a loan which has been advanced without interest for tiie cpmpletaoa of tihe church fence. As soon as the above amounts are cleared off, it is hoped that an effort will in mute^to fmrnre an organ, the want of which has been loa&f; ett. The concert commenced with a part song, "Men of Harlech," by members of the choir, which was creditably sung. A solo, "Bridesmaid song," followed, tmd was givjea with expression, ftfe singer being loudly applanded at its close. A couple of dnets (pianoforte) find two songs, all of which were given witi? taste aad feeling, elicited applause. A vocal duet," II Eittora," by a ladyand gentleman, which was given in good style, closed the first part of the pro gramme. The pecond part consisted of three duets and several songs. Judging from the ap plause which followed «eh selection, the in strumentalists and vocalists seemingly had no cause to complain of want of appreciation on the part of the audience. The whole affair was & brilliant success, and was one of tbe largest gatherings of the kind that has taken place for some time. ' The FaMr of Oolu and bis company ap peared at the Theatre Boyal on^Thnrsday evening to a -moderate attendance.
