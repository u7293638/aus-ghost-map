How to Treat Stammerers. I wish to thow parents and gunrdiunswliut u dreadful thing to a high-spirit* d and ambitious boy stammering is. I say emphatically, ,if taken in its curliest stages, it can beoffoetually chocked. Peoplo are apt to imagine that it is a thing of . Mmill moment, and a defect which tho boy mil ' grow out of.' Fathers, I toll you plainly that, trifling as it may, appear to you, it is a matter, of toiriblo importance to the lad's futuro welfare, comfort,.and happiness. In somo odd casos, undoubtedly, sutferors do ' grow out of it;' but in the great majority it grows upon' thciri till they become confirmed, stammerers, and thoir .wliolo lifo is overshadowed by a dark cloud. A fow'words to the general public as; to their treatment of stammerers or Btuitjrers. Many kiud-lisnr'odmen and women endeavour, to help tho sufl'eror by saying tlio word which they imagine lie is striving to utter. Friends, don't do this. In tho majority of casos you will got hold : of tho Wrong word, and iriako his confusion worse confounded.: And apart from this, it is" ex?, tromoly galling to him to bo'dependont on othor people in this way. If you wish to earn his gratitude and respect, .endeavour" to listen to liim as if you had not noticed anything peculiar in his speech.' Never laugh at a stammerer. If you could for once put yourself in liis place and feel' the unutterable liumiliation.which ho experiences, you would nover again let tho ghost of a smilo cross your fiico when talking to one. When I liavo gone into shops or oflicos and, whilst striving hard to make ray self intelligiblo, have soon tho clerics or assistants grinning as though they thought it fino fun, it lias sometimes boon very difficult to ^restrain myself from 'going for tliom' uud administering a salu tary. leatfoiu -1'Yoiu CasacWs Family Mayaz'uic IJorl'cbntart/.,'
