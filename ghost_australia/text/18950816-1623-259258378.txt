Miss Snow, the eh\\. v, s-.-tzed his hand in both hers. "Permit me to be the first to c m- griduhtto you," she said, tremulously, j "Ita is a brave girl. What has been' done is right.

A this the briditmr-s in th" girl's face suddenly clouded with something that resembled sham", ar.d her eyes fdl. " Don't take it so much fo 'netrt, dear Miss Snow," she murmuri d. " Whatever happens, I shall never forget your goodness." ''There! I have made you remember all that trouble, and 1 ought not, tonight," said Miss Snow, remorsefully. " I'nt do not worry, deary ; it can't help coming right now." Then, turning to tho listening, curious Frank, she added, earnestly. " I am sure that you, Arthur —for I must cdl you so—I am sure that you are not afraid of the consequences of this step ?" Frank grasped the hand she exfen'tea cordially, as ho replied, with entire truth : " I am not afraid of anything." She gazed a moment admiringly at his handsome and manly, if somewhat audaciems features, thou at Ita, as though the sight of tho comely pair was a joy; and, suiiiiiig through tears, she pass, d on.
