I NOTHING ' IN THE RAILWAY CROSSING. (Dedicated to the Railway Commissioners). There are some who die on mountains high, And some in war's commotion ; Some suicide and cross the tide To satisfy a notion, And some there be who death must see Amidst the tempest tossing, But far the most give up the ghost Upon the railway crossing. Some silly loons jump from balloons And meet the fate that follows ; Some lose their breath and choke to death Upon the hangman's gallows, But those each day we lay away Beneath the headstones mossing Who try to beat the engine fleet, And die right at the crossing. Oh, you may toy with buzz-saws coy Whenever they're in motion, Or on a feather in stormy weather Attempt to cross the ocean, And even jaw your mother-in-law, Who always does the bossing, But don't go near — if death you fear— The fatal railway crossing.
