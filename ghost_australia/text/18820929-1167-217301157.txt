A Glass of Cold Water. Where is the liquor which God the Etern&l; brews for all his children ? Not in the simmering still, over smoky fires choked with poisoning gases, and surrounded with the stench of sickening odours and rank corruptions, doth your Father in heaven prepare the precious essence of life, the pure cold water. But in the green glade and grassy dell, where the red deer wanders and the child loves to play, there God brews it. And down, low down in the deepest valleys, where the fountains murmur and rills sing ; and high upon the tall mountain tops, where the naked granite glitters like gold in the sun; where the storm-cloud brooods and the thunderstorms crash ; and away far out on the wild wild sea, where the hurricane howls music and the big waves roar; the chorus swelling the march of God ; there He brews it—that beverage of life and health-giving water. And everywhere it is a thing of beauty, gleaming in the dewdrop, singing in the summer rain, sliining in the icegem, till the leaves all seem turned to living jewels, spreading a golden veil over the setting sun, or a wliite gauze round the midnight moon. Sporting in the cataract, sleeping in the glacier, dancing in the liail shower, folding its bright snow curtains softly about the wintry world, and weaving the many coloured iris, that seraph's zone of the sky, whose warp is the rain-drop of earth, whose woof is the sunbeam of heaven all chequered over with celestial flowers by the mystic hand of refraction. Always it is beautiful; that life-giving water; no poison bubbles on its brink [ its foam brings not madness and murder; no blood stains its liquid glass; pale widows and starving orphans weep no burning tears in its depths; no drunken, shrieking ghost from the grave curses it in the words of eternal despair. Say on, my friends, would you exchange it for tne demon's drink, alcohol P —J. B. GotrGH.
