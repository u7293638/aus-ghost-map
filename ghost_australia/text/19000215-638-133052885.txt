sis WA& Frcm'Private Sosthev, of Bowral. ; We arrived at fcHe Cape on ths-^fch, and anchored 'in the harbour.

In the tent X' damped in thare were eighteen men, and' aS a tremendous storm calm© on it added ziot to the conif ort pf the scene. Next day, 'however, we. pitched bur own tents and are now pretty comfort able as things g&. The country out here is ivery flat. Indeed, from Capetown right away through there is nothing^ bat a series' of-plains (veldts); ar^'smMraiid^very stor^ Miscalled kopjes. There is not a tree to ?be seen anywhere for love or money, and |the ground is very dry and sandy I cab tell fyou the heat is pretty well- trabearable. (There is no miatakb Soath A'friea is pretty ;warm. We stayed- afc Duar one night a£d 'then went::on to the Orange River, which 'is 'not the river you -wpuld imagine itf was on perusing the map but', .merely a, chain of ;dirty, muddy water. We enjoyed a : great ?qld storm of rain there and some of the men took the opportunity of getting, out of the train and 'having a shower bath. We passed 'jthrousrh^ Belmont where a big fight took placc 'and had tea there., The railway |tation was riddled through with rifle bullets. We also passed j through G! ras0pa,n' i vyhere the Biitisli vlost thi-ee riaval officers. Th6 place wh6rei we are ca^jjed- witnessed a ! I pretty hot tint©.
