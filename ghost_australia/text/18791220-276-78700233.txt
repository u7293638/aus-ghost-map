TAKE NOT YOUR LIFE. You look at.the shining river Yon gaae at the deep, deep sea And because oi youv maiiy troubles, 1 And because oÂ£ your misery, While the beautiful sun is shining, Or the moonbeams softly fall, You say, perhaps, in your anguish, This hour I will end it all, Oh tarry, world-weary mortal, And question before you leap: 11 Is it honest to end the being That never was mine to keep ?" *. Is it manly to leave the dear ones To battle with oare alone ?" " Is it safe with no heavenly summons, To rush to the groat unknown V* Remember, if you have oourage To look, at the matter right, That no trouble will last lor ever, And the btave will wiu the fight. That, oil iriend, if we live for others, Though driuhing at sorrows fount, When compared with the joy we give them, Our paiu is of small account. Then gird on the soldier's armour, And march to the front to-day, Making war on tho morbid fancies That, ghost-like, iuiest your way; Laying by ail your selfish motives, Contented to kiss the rod Llviug out his appointed season A man, with your trust in God.
