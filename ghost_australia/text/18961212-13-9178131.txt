THE LAST ENTRY: A STORY ,,,,. FOR YACHTSMEN ? BY CLARK RUSSELL. ! CHAPTER XII. : WHAT IS TO BE DONE - In the year of this story, Old Leisure was still going to sea He flourished as pleasantly upon the ocean as amidst the liens and dung dulls, the milkmaids and dunes of the Poyser farmyard He brought his main topsail to the mast with one reluctance, when there was anything to be seen or talked so, he went on board the stranger and dined with him muted His struieCi in return, then leisure he) proceeded There was no prompt despatch to spoil, of, no urgency 'The mud was the prevailing condition of the immense distances n Inch the wooden eil bud to traverse Old Leisure kept his eye to windward, and hauled out his bowling, but it is a time of gambling of doing, and of a rustling for winds until too much care Only in such a time is this non drill 16 with it she could not conten e a large full rigged ship homeward bound from India, full of impatient hearts, love to, it Till a derelict schooner within his mind, and the commander taking plenty of time to reason about her with a gentleman who was inst lately concerned in her unexpected astounding apparition and log book narrow the "The thought of Miss A Anderson being at the mercy of a crew of mutinous ruffians is unbearable," exclaimed Captain Parry "What is to be done ' Adi see me, in the name of God, Captain You know-) you know I have told you she was to be my wife You me an old sailor For God's sake, counsel me. " "If I could be sure that they had made off in their boat and were still afloat in her," answered the Captain, "I should know how to advise on But if they have been received on board a ship, then I don't see what can be done For in M hal direc lion may that ship be heading' Enough if your young lady should be safe, sir Supposing her to be on board a ship, I have no doubt of your hearing good news of her in course of time-alter your arm al in England " He opened the cabin door, and called to one of the biggest hauls "M) compliments to the chief officer, and ask him to come to me " Mr Mulriad) quickly presented him self "We have some notion, said Captain Barrington, addressing his mate, whilst he laid his hand upon the log of the Mowbray, "that the crew of the schooner nil) have left her in then be it, taking the young lady Mile Hiern Send a couple of hands don't trouble the young gentleman,' said he, until a supercilious, smile, finishing almost as it appeared upon his firm lips, ' but a couple of sharp hands to the royalists beads Gue one of them this glass." He handed Mr Mulieady a, binocular ' Let the other take the ship's telescope aloft 1 want the sea carefully swept Mal c them understand that the must creep in their march to the very i eggs, for how far off is a boat visible But they might sight the gleam of her lug STILL " Mr Mulrcart) took the glasses and bent as if it) out. Captain Parry stood at the open window, listening to what was passing, straining his sight, also, with consuming passions of dread, blind desire, helpless wrath at the star blue hue of the Rea That swept the brilliance of the heavens Within little more than a league The captain of the ship went to a locker, and took out a chart of the Atlantic He spread it, and called to Captain Parry The officer turned and eagerly stepped to the chart. He saw zigzag prickings or lines upon the white sheet, as though somebody had been trying to represent flashes of lightning Each line terminated in a little dotted circle These were the "rains " But then there were also the doldrums, and the motive power of that ship, the Alfred, lay in the breeze that in the doldrums blows in the delicate catspaw that scared) has power to run a clever into a gWed breast ' That was our situation at noon jester deal," said the commander, putting Jus a finger upon the northernmost little circle "There is no land for leagues, as you may observe " What are those rocks'" observed Parr), peering "St Paul's Island, a horrible hornet's r nest of black fangs, entirely out of the boat's reach I am not sure that I have ever heard of a boat effecting a landing An) one cast ashore there must perish 1 There is nothing to eat or drink It is Hit J desolation of bell," added the commander, 1 with a note of religious fervour in his speech, and a dreadful Binf like a night- mare of storm rains day and night round 1 those rocks " "What is to be done" said Captain J Pain, lifting himself free from the claim "If they are in a boat they cannot be far s distant they have not long left The schooner, but every stroke of the car 3 carries them further away), and renders the 1 search more hopeless I "The search'" exclaimed the commander 1 in a note of inquiry and surprise I don't mean in this ship, of course," <" said the officer, spin!
