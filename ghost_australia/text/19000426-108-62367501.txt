PORTFOLIO. S. Mark's Dy.--The lesson of S. Markls life is intended to be one of encouragement to those who have made an ignoble start in Spiritual things. Donst let anyone reason that becaume he has been feeble in the be gnning of his career, that he must remain feeble to the end. Just as S. Thomas was the last to believe in the Resurrection, buhat when he did believe gare the strongest of all utterances of that belief-so . Mlark who was lukewarm in the early ages was amongst the most faithful, and active, and useful in his later history. Like the patriarch Jacob, his history is one of pro gressire advance showing what God's grace can accomplish in the development of character. It may be, it probably was so, that S. Mark felt this weakness, and was resolved to do his best to overcome it-and that he did overcome, partly by dwelling on the active oide of our Lord's character, '- the Sion of the tribe of Judah," and also by personal intercourse with those two Apostles who were fired with the greatest zeal, and did more and dated more for Christ and His Church than any besides. Let all faint-hearted Christians take courage, and as S. Barnabas did not despair about S. Mark, so let not them despair alout themselves. Let them strive to go forwar , to take a wider view. and be fired by the iHtly Ghost with a nobler ambition. .-C . trlt J 'nfr.r
