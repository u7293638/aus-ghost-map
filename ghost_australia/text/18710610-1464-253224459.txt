THE MAN OP MYSTERY. The great and mysterious man, who was consigned to obscurity a short time since by a not very brilliant leading article in the Herald, is about to reappear. He is on his way to the House again. He commenced the journey last Saturday, starting from Liverpool, and may be expected to turn up any day. He is quite unchanged. It is needless to say, that his start was made under the most encourag ing circumstances. He took occasion to point out, that the opinions of the late President of the Council of Education, Professor Smith, were " calculated to do very much mischief." How characteristic this is. The Prefessor had given about seventeen years of his life to the cause of public education — had been identified with it many years before we heard of Mr. Parkes as a patron of education, and it was necessary to abate somewhat of the Professor's pretensions. And he had added to his sins the unpardonable one of being (like the country) a rather heavy creditor of Mr. Parkes. This was enough. The great and mysterious man is always hard upon those who have enjoyed the proud distinction of obliging him. The Professor has just left the colony, and will not hear for months what a dangerous enemy to the public schools he is thought to be. However, that is a matter of little importance. The great fact is, the Man of Mystery is coming ! Lackey is with him and Wearne. That is all the party at present. But they have made a grand start. The Public School children of Liverpool have recognised the party, for the Herald informs us that they sang God save the Queen, and gave three cheers each for Her Majesty and Mr. Parkes ! There are to be no more ghosts, or bloody conspiracies, or anti-Irish crusades, except against Martin, who is now looked upon as the most dangerous Irishman in the country. Perhaps we may find out at last, that he was, after all, the missing Fenian whom the Man of Mystery wanted. »
