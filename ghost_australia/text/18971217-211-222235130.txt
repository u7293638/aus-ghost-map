Came Through Ghosts Terse of fortune has just come under my notice. Mrs. W was the daughter of bumble parenlB living in an agricultural village in Westmoreland.. She was one of eight children supported ou 16s a week. At 18 she married with good prospects. At 26 she became a widow with five little children totally unpro vided for. She sought parochial relief for her children, and went out nearly every day charing, thus keeping her humble little home tegetber. Two years ago an elderly couple (lady and gentleman) coming to the neighborhood, re quired two servants, only to find that no one would enter their service, the house havine the reputation of being haunted. Nothing daunted, this woman, hearing of their dilemma, undertook the duties of the household for the old couple. The lady died eight months ago ; now the old gentleman has departed also. Mrs, is left everything, including a good -sized villa residence, splendidly furnished, several cottage?, a few acres of land, and an income from several sources, at present yield ing Â£420 a year ! This is absolutely true.
