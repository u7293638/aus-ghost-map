ATHLETIC_NOTES. (By Mno.i The time is now drawiner near for our peds to try conclusions with each other, and the track this week has been very lively. Sprint runnors from fourteen years up to our champion mile and Ladies' ?Purse runners have been doing strong '.work.' : ? ?'..'' ::?-?: -I' notice that Markhavn, Willis, Riley and others are training for the mile, and by the way they shape'there should he good racing over this distance. -??-. ? . Ahearne andhis.men seem to be improv ing every day and should be heard of at Latrobe. Blano and Walsh, stick! to it every night. Moore and Lideter are .'both going very well,' but ?!? do not' like their show anywhere this year; 7: They are i both good men, but have been roughly handi capped.'''' ; ?-;..;'; - : - - 1 r.-. . -: ; - , i . ; .,:i'p ' Tlie handicaps for Rosb and St. Leonards are now out; and on the whole: have' given, satisfactiori.although of course they' are not by any means perfect'.': Roes being the first to' appear, I r will deal with them at once. To Begin with; there are agreat niimberof assumed names, a system which1 should be done away with, as not only, handicippera :;;bilfc the- publio:.!.ara uJisled.rlfa; man iii .

'W'1'' entries ;' 'for ':?' 'the' ' Sheffield Handicap,- - -a .riuuibar.-v.wb.ich can^ not tie gru'mbieoV 'hV. ' Alf. Smith of Hobart, is at Bcratch, but I do not . care for^his snow; ' ' The ' best treated tner are Boon, (10 yardsyand Sibloy, (llyards); . It lae'ems sfirang'b . 'that . Boon Bbould have ^received so hutch, 'sp.emg that he ,won the ''St. 'Leonards' Handicap. Sibley'shbuld run 'ti'good race. J.'H. Stariwix is the best treated 'man from tho' North, arid' shbuU ?i'give' a good account of 'himsolf. If he 'had ' the1 samp luck' as^ his trainer ' had |he must 'win.' J.'. Moore on hia'performance's should ' ' nave another yard, ' and accordiri g ' : to , my ''idea 'with 'his [present 'handicap' he';cannpt -win. . B:: Boss is,' 'I believe, an assumed 'name .'for 'Morton, who, with -ten ' yards, ': -should 'fun intb'-a place, butlhear ttiat'ho has: been unwell for thd last couple, bf !; ''weeks and has not been on tho track since.; v Wolfe ought to' have a bigj'say with, eight yards.' 'The Terry brothers, ? Leonard, ? Bryan, :and;: Vision will, it' they. Btart, .;. make some: of the men near the. limit run j to boat them; ' JDeerfcot,. who has nine .' yar'ds/is.said to:be the assumed name for :, Salisbury, and if this is so, the race should .?be a'gift to him. . For the Ladies' .Purse ?there are also 27 entries, and if it is not : won by. Stanwix or. C. Howell, who.have a . big startj-they ought never.to run. asrain.; . Tv J. Sauriders isat scratch* but will have /to get some ''go quick 'to enable him to i catch'soniei of. the limit :-.men. .Leonard, iWolfe,1 Vision, and Deerfoot will not be .far out at the finish. The I Hurdle should /?'be a gift to Wolfe! but;.he may be put ?..down bv Siblev. Saunders, or, lies. . ; . : ». !i;St..Leonards have received , ,the best on .?:? tries i of -.? any association .thiB .. year, this libeing no' doubt due to the day being altered ?: to Saturday. .They have received, no less . than .160 entries for tbe handicaps, but the ''allotments were hurried over too quickly. , For the Handicap Blano.is scratch, but will not have the ghost of a ohance, be being at : least a' couple of yards too far bapk. ,.W. ? Ahearne with 3£ yards is treated very, well, considering that he ran a dead heat for 'second hist year with only two yards from ? Blane. ' Lidster.is not well -treated with ?j'6J yards, :but H.-Boori is in about his pro^ : tiertilace. 'Walsh with: his performances .should have had a start from Darcey, but ?to;my surprise, it . is . the; other, may about, .-.and ,1 think the; best man of these .two: will ..get a place. ..
