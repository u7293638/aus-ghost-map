YES I SUFFER. Yes I suffer, yes I do, For my feet are dyed with blue. The sox I bought when down the street; Your tears would flow if you saw my feet. Oh ! Jack, you are wrong-I bought a pair too I'll hold up my leg, and take off my shoe. By jove you are right-my foot is quite black I'll give up the ghost, and lay on my back. Oh, do not desert me, but let us both hope ; We'll try the effect of the Magical Soap. You can get it for cash, and many things wore, If you just run up to the Central Store. Hush! When you are there; if you've a shilling to spare Forget" this wicked world " and its racket, But invest like a man, all the cash that you can, In fMorrison's wonderful packet.
