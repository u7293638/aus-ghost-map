*;::z -^ THE HOLY GRAIL, r;™: .'?'' ' ' ? FSecond Notice:! '? ' ' Thevtwo Arthurian Idylls which remain to be noticed are 'Pelleas and Etbarre,' and the ' 'Passing of Arthur.' The first named is of, 'the whole series, perhaps the one in1 ;vhich.we ' find the fewest traces of the peculiar inspiration of -the master. \ Sir Pelleaa is a noble-hearted youth, full of all | the freshness and simplicity of his years, whom j Arthur makes a Knight when tilling up the gaps j in the Round Table which 'had been left by the Holy 'Quest. ' 1 know,' ho says, All that belongs to knighthood, and 1 love : . But the -lady of his love had been, till a day or two before, only the creation of bis young and chwulroua fancy. Resting -in the shades of tho Forest of iBuan, he saw a cavalcade of damsels, attended by threo knights, who had lost their way- It .was the fail- Etfcarue, on her way to seek the prize of beauty in the lists at Caerleon. Pelleas immediately conceived a sudden passion for a very unworthy object — ? The beauty of her flesh a'oash'd the boy, As tho' it' were the beauty of her soul : Eor as the -base man judging of the good : Puts his wa baseness in him by default Of will and nature, so did Pelleas lend All the young beauty of his own soul to hers, Believiug her ; and when she spoke to him, Stammer1*!, and could not make her a reply. For out of t»he waste islands had he come, \ Where saving his own sisters he had known Scarce any but the women of hie isles, Rough wives that laugh'd and scream'd against the gulls, Makera of nets, and living from the sea. Ettarre aceeepts his devotion for the chance ? of winning the golden circlet by his means. He is knigted by Arthur, who keeps his older and mightier champions from the lists in order that the young lover may win the prize. He does gain it, and his lady is gracious to him for the last time. He follows her to her home, and is treated by her with studied insult aud indignity . These be the ways of ladies, Pelleas thought, To those who love them, trials of our Saith ; Yea, let' her prove me to the uttermost;, For loyal to the uttermost am I, He is at last convinced, however, and takes Ms leave of her thus : Lady, for indeed 1 loved you and I deemed you beautiful, I cannot brook to s-ie ^-ur beauty marr'd Thro' evil spite ; and -if yo love me not, I cannot bear. to see y«w so forsworn ; I had liefer ye were worthy of my love, Than to be loved again of you — farewell;' And tho' ye .kill my hope, not yet my love, Vex not yoursulf : ye will uot see mo more. Etbarre begins to be impressed with a dim idea that Ma nature is something higher than he*», aud that she is not worthy of him. Upon thiu Gawain, ' the light o' lo,ve,' arrives and offers Pelleas fco obtain her confidence and plead with her in his favour. Pelleas consents, but soon dtacovers that Gawain has played him fadae. 35416 two are asleep and in hia power, but he Bpares their lives, and, to show tho* he niighb have slain them, leaves his sword, and EtUrre ?fey The circlet oi the tournoy round her brows, And the sword of the tourney across her throat. It may perhaps be «onaii.l erect hypercritical to object to fcisa rhythm of the lafit two verses just quated ; coming from any one but such r master of rhythm as Mr. Tdnnyaou, the line would probably pass without notice, but in a poem of his the forced accentuation necessary to give ifc fche iacabic itaw is ft phenomenon to ^hich we are quite unaccustomed. Pelleas goes half mad, aud losing his respect for his ov/n love, begins to question all his other illusions. On Iuk journey homo he staita from a dream, And being ware of some one nigh, . / . Sent hands upon him, «» to tear him, crying 'False! and I held thce pure a« G-uusevere.' i Bub Perceval stood near him ami replied, , 'Am t bui i'ftlse as Guinevere is puro ? Qr art fchou mazed with iire*tns ? Or being one Of our fxee-«poken Twblo &tsb; nob heard That Lancelot,' — there check' il -.himoeM and paused. ' Then fared ib with Sir Pelleas as. with ouo Who goto a wound in. l.mtt;le, ; and the sword » That made it plunges) thro' fche voiuk! .again, And pricks it deeper : and he shrank arid- wail'd ? ' la the Queen iaiso ?' and Percevale waa; mute. '? Have »ny of our Round Tablo held {their vows Y' ? And Pevcovalo made answer not a word . 'la the King true?' 'The King.!'' said Perce»aio, ' ' Why fcheu leV men couple at once with wolves. What ! art thou mad ?' Pelleas, in his frenzy, attacks aud 13 overthrown by Lancelot. Refusing to bo comforted by Guinevere, he Lifted up an eye so fierce She quail'd, aud he, kisaing, ' 1 have no sword,' Sprang froQi the door into the dark. The Queen Look'd hard upon her lover, he on her ; And each foresaw the dolorous day to he : . And all talked died, aa iu a grove all .-song ? Beneath the shadow oi some bird of prey ; Thenalongsilence came upon the hall, Aud Modred thought, 'The time is hard at '..handy ;.! .yv..-. ... / '. '?. ? ' . '??? ? ??? Thus has the sin of Guinevere broken down all that; . ' ? ?'?-::, .!;i =?''? ? f :' ? '?'.;?? ? '? ?: -?.:?-:?,. .?- ' ?? ' . : . , fair order of (bin- V Table Round, ..} A glorious company, the li..\y.i-r of men ; To serve as model for the uiiyh'ty world, And be the fair beginning of a, .time. The maideu love t-f 'Elaine for Lancelot, tho i wiadoin of Merlin, the fair fame of Tristram and Ysolt, the ti listing, hopefal youth of Pelleas, \ are all withered and ruined by her fault and her ? example. Few, we should hope, have read in ' ' Guineveie' of the pc- nitouco of the Queen and of the reproachful but measureless pity of Arthur without being moved to their very depthti. The Passing of Arthur' shows us the hero whoa, after leaving the ?joavent at Alcues bur)', ho is on his way to the 'last weird battle in the vest.' Then ? came on Arthur sieeping, Gawa;n kill'd j In Lancelot's w.ir, the ghost of Gawain blown Along a wanderiiinj wind, aijd past hjs oav Went shrilling ' Hollow, hollow all delight ! Hail, kirn* .' to- morrow thou i'ha,lt pass away. Farewell I there is aa iale of rest for.thee, And I am blown along i\ wandering wind, And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight. Some fine lines follow, which we quote as an instance of the happy introduction by our author into English poetry of the Homeric ex pansion of a simile : — And fainter onward, like wild birds that ohs'ige Their Beaton iu tho pighfc nod w,n\ their way From cloud to cloud, down the long wuid the dream .

When we Bay that the ''P.ir stag of Arthur' is worthy of i/he 'Mortc d' Arthur' which nn\v forms a part of it, wo hevo givea it nearly the highest pi-u3e R'hich it i« in o»ir power to bestow.

'?? ln;tho 'Morted' Arthur', we heard the last of the hero when tho mysterious' bargo ' ' i .ook' d one black dot against the verge of dawn, And on the mere the wailing died1 away. ? , TV ', this now follows a laulelotatioh of Sir -}et!ivere that his lord had passed 'bo be King among the dead,' and then -from the dawn it seern'd bhere came, buo taint \\* from beyond the limit of the world, i ike the last echo boi-no of a great cry, Rounds, as if sooie fair city were one voice A round a Kiog leturniny from his wars. And the new sun rose bringing the new year. Wo almost mhu tho framework in which the poem used to be sot, .and in which the poet dro&mpd; that Arthur was come again, not as a mailed knight, ? but as a modern gentleman Of shikihest port ; and all tlie people cried. ' Ailhur is come again ; he cannot die.' Then those that stood upon the bills behind tti 'pc died — ' come again, and chiice as fair.' And foither inland, voice echoed — 'come With fill «ood thinly, and war shall be no more.''. After this, one is inclined to resent the story told by the old chronicler, how the resting place of the great British hero prince was indeed in in the Isle of Avalon, and how in the reign of Edward I. search was made by the Abbot of Glastonbury in the spot indicated by im- memorial tradition, between two stone pyramids in the precincts of the Abbey. There at a great depth, they came upon a flat metal cross of ancient form, bearing the following inscription in the rudest characters. “Hic jacct rex Arturius in insulâ Avaloniâ,” and nine feet deeper upon two skeletons, one of gigantic size, with the skull gashed with seven deep wounds ; and another still possessing a remnant of the golden hair which lay humbled “in the dust at Almesbury.” The remains were placed by the hands of King Edward and Queen Eleanor themselves in a costly tomb in the Abbey Church and the destruction of the monument and of its contents is one more atrocity to be laid to the account of Henry VIII’s Commissioners. This prosaic version of the story may serve to make it a less terrible drop from the Idylls to the Miscellaneous Poems at the end of the volume. “The Northern Farmer” is a pendant to the poem already published with “Enoch Arden.” It is quite as good in its way as its pre- decessor. The other was the old style, this is the new style of Northern Farmer. He gives us his view of love marriages in particular, and in general of what is and what is not worth hav- ing in this world, in a sufficiently diverting man- ner. \ --?' u't tiwjn 'ear my 'erse'o leq', as they cantors !
