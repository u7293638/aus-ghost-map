Select Poetry. THE TEAR. When the soft tear steals silently down from the eye, Take no note of its course, nor detect the slow sigh ; From some spring of shy sorrow its origin flows, Some tender remembrance that weeps as it goes. Ah! it is not to say what will bring to the mind The sweet joys departed, the friends left behind ; A tune, or a song, or the time of the.year, Strikes the key of reflection, and moans in the ear. Through the gay scenes of youth the remem- brancer strays, Till mem'ry steps back on old pleasures to gaze ; Fleeting shadows they seem that glide calmly away, The remains of past hours, and the ghosts of a day. When we set out in life, each event has its charms. Enkindles the fancy, and all the heart warms; 'Tis this makes us look on the joys that are past, With an eye that turns coldly to glance on the last. I.et the tears, then, flow on, nor mark the full eye, 'T is the soul's secret off'ring no mortal should spy ; Few hearts are prepared for a rite so divine, When the feelings alone pay their vows at the shrine.
