CUP DAY. INTRODUCTION. BY MONCURE CONWAY. A gentleman in San Francisco, who had witnessed a Cup Day in Melbourne, described it to me with such enthusiasm, not to say solommty, that it occurred to me to ask whether the Holy Grail might not have been a prize cup, and the Knights of the Round Table, certain of the old English gentry, engaged in its quest. This chilled my companion, but I nevertheless resolved that I could not leave Australia until I had seen the famous race. I can now understand that man's enthusiasm. The English "Derby," "Oaks,' and other races, had not prepared me for finding in a horse race an event of such social im portance and human significance as that of yesterday. To horse racing in itself it is difficult to attach any serious import in the present day. It has, however, its archaeo logicil side. The man who first appealed among his fellows mounted on horseback multiplied his power over them by a score. The man who first tamed a WILD steed to draw or bear burdens of several men was a pimitive prince. Ths invention of gunpowder diminished the multiple of the man on horseback, and the discovery of stream has reduced the supremacy of the early teamster. But there were many ages when the breeding of swift and strong horses was a most serious human occupation, and, whatever may now be said of Parliaments adjourning to witgness races, it waa once of national importance that the breeding of fine horses should bo stimulated and encouraged. In England, that time has so far passed that grave philosophers have come to look upon Epsom and Ascot with a certain disfavour. They point out that a horse fitted to win a race is fit for nothing else; he is like a card, and if he is not an ace of trumps he is only pasteboard. There is much truth in this. Not long ago an English marquis, whose horse had been defeated in a race, went up to the animal on the racecourse, took off the bridle and stiuck the horse with it, pro claiming, as it bounded away, that any body who should catch him might have him. The thoroughbred was caught, but the new owner could neither feed nor sell him. The theory of racing was that the breed of horses would be improved thereby, but that original utility has been replaced by the secondary interest of winning stakes and prizes. It need hardly be said to those who have attended the greaat English races, that the scenes by which they are surrounded are not of such a character as to conciliate those who object to them, either on utilitarian or moral grounds. But it sometimes happens that an institution survives its onginal purpose by ingenious adaptation to other and new purposes. If around any such custom there has grown a scene of beauty, if it has become gradually invested with usages which subserve civility and popular enjoyment, it must not be supposed that such wholesome " cakes ánd ale" are to be dispensed with, because some are puritanical. Nor must it be imagined that because such a scene as the " Cup ' costs much in proportion to the brevity and evanescence of the enjoyment, that it should be discountenanced by serious people. A lady once remarked to Goethe that it appeared frivolous to give a dinner patty, at so much cost of time and money, 'when the plea sure of it so soon passes away. But Goethe answered, "The effect of it never passes away ". The same may be said of many pleasures that seem transient. It must, indeed, be admitted that in some cases it is unfortunate that the effects do not pass away. This is unhappily true of some of the effects of racing in England, and it may be true of racing in Austialia. Of that so casual an observer as myself can hardly give an opinion. All I can say is that during the eiight hours that I passed to day at Flemington many of the evils visiblo on similar occisions in 1 uropo «eie conspicuously absout Tho ' loud} ' element «as not thoio , tho "rou0.i" element «as not thoio lho much t ilkcd of "larnkin «horn I liad meint to depict, A. as not discovoi iblo I did not seo ono drunl on poison and tho fist people, so prominent at Epsom, must also havo selected somo othoi ]heo and cecasion There «as somo i ul_. mty, 1 good many " loud " dresses, but not much loudnoss of any othci kind and m ill tho vast eiond a not iblo good nature Suiely no vast ciowd «as e\ci moie docile Tust beforo tho Cup raco about five hundí ed people m then eager ness climbed on topof thogrand stand, and a fe« policemen elearod thom oil in live minutes «ith so little ofloit that the meidout o\cited tho attention of but few A « uo of the olhciiil h md «as sufhoient to ollect in immediate elcaianco of tho win so as often as tho multitudes mthucdon it to seo tho costumos on the I m ii I lily in tho morning I wilkod over tho com se so to say With i genial and thot Highly liifoiniod guido I «as ablo to leu lho aitistio anangomonts for this B eui e\ent, the churning apaitinenta f i tho Go. unoi, lus guests and fnends, tho coimmtteo rooms, tho ladies looms, tho rooms for disibltd jockoys the piOBs looms and ininj othoi cuofully doviBod nccominoditions Such nicoty m ovoiy detail Buch anticipations of every con tin.cncy oven to the needles and thioads oí uiiious colours, and the fullers oaith ii othoi cosmotics «hieh ladies might uqime, «ould alone raise tho rionung ton i leos out of tho oidmary couisu of Bpoitmg events Yoi some hours I stiollod ilono along tho spaces whcio »n.lity propirutions woio being mado for the thousinds of «Inch I was as yet the hist nu rial ¡bevon silent oyster bins «ereittonded by silent individuals, still inoiooxtcnsivo lows of bottles standing uecoratively behind thoir punoyors, placiuls containing sucli valaablo m foi mation foi the people as tho prices of «mes and iles, all tried to hint to mo tlio .astnesB of what was appioaehing then thoio «as the lawn with its fouu um and its paitónos of flowers, all blushing unseen as yot not dreaming of the moving lustlos by which they «ero to become p do md moilcctual lhen tlioro weio eoi tam signs that this fino artistic fr uno « as about to lca\ o its piotui o Oi, to iii HILO tho similitude, that tho waitois lind olhcials weio piepaung foi nttion ino busy caietakor bogan to show a ceitam quickness in his movomonts, his toieo lang out with somo vivacity, not to my shupncss, and tho mon undor Ins command «ero almost military m thoir prompt obodieneo Now ovory man was at Ina post, and thoro «as to bo no sur rondor beforo any monster mass that choso to como Amid this aohtudo, about 10 o'clock, I saw in tho distanco a gathoring of wag gons and cabs, and lho raising of tonts, mid hastened over to that rogion At ?4>som that would havo been the region of Double hoaded Calves, Fat Women, of tho Living Skeleton, tlio Spotted Girl, and similar side shows But these wero jiot to bo found at Flemington In the largo oloment of grotosqueno, by no means an uninteresting element, the fc-glish l>erb/ has its one advantase over P3__-A--tsr Q-F .FXi-BI^I-ISra-TOIsr BAOECOTJBSE. tlio Cup At Epsom tho gipsies, the noiiiidic foicat folk, mo much tho most on tci turning pooplo , the Gi and Stand is dismal bcsido tho Richaidson fellows, whoio tho heaviest of heavy villams plot iganiBt tanned beauty ind uinoecnco in pink cotton ¡leslies Yet 1 kmmgtoii was not 'without its eoceno do\olonmoiita of tho gio tcaquc, which m tlio futuio will bo cuiious onougli 'llioio waa exhibited tho Gieat Slunk lu tlio woida of i li indbill, " Tust captuiod, tho laigcat monatoi o\oi ciu"ht in Pentland Baj, and aftor a feaiful stiugklo lies quiotly within ' A man at tho dooi pi o c1 umtd that ono of those who stiugglcd with this monatci w is nisido-niBidc tho tent, not tho monstoi -to describo the tiptuio, and with much publie Bpnit warned the publie not to loso this ono oppoitmuty of seoni.,' this monatoi of tho deep I behe\o I was tho only p ition of his exhibition up to 11 o'clock lXccpt that its mouth was painted piotoinatuiully led, it was i lían mutation of a ahailv Jt hld Ino lows of teeth, mil ono could not but I lespoct tho self lesti lint that lind not given it si\ A sun bio« ned mutton ne u by piesided o\oi aioulotto tibie, and took ina oonaidcinbloiuuubei of shillings till tlio pohco appealed , thon BOHÍO Wauk misgiving-appen ed in hot colinton mee, and hoi whoel of foi tuno ceased 1 sup poBO hot t iblo must have boen too at ti ictive, foi coitain dice pla} eis it what was called the Amoi lean gamo of "sweat ' wont on undisturbed Oi was this duo to a feeling of nitei nation ii comity on tho pait of the police?

It cost a mint of money to drain it. But the committee were clear-headed men, and saw their possibilities. They got an act of Parliament which requites them to spend their money on the course or in prizes, and they soon got their coffers full enough to do both in the handsomest style. I don't mind telling you that when the improv ements of the course are all done, our prices will be the richeat in the world. But that will be a long time yet. How much will the new works cost? Well, that is kept pretty much a secret, for it looks too bold to tell everyone how much weare going to add to the£150,000 we have olready spent. Still, I don't mind telling you that Byron Moore-the secretary, I mean- has a little schemo on the board which will make so large a hole in another £80,000 that the fringe will bo very ragged indeed. It's a lot of money, as you say, but he does not believe in tinkering. His improve- ments are all puit of a splendid nnd uniform whole, just like those of his indefatigable predecessor, Mr. Bagot, who worked like a Trojan to get the place in order. This was the study of lúa life, and he was never tired of planting, building, planning, and designing with an ardour which will always keep his memory green, and which certainly kept his committee's handB continually dipping into the committee's funds. He died in harness, poor lellow, sincerely regretted, after seeing many of his pet schemes realised. The family, you may be sure, were not forgotten by the club, and now Mr. Moore is no less activo than his lamented friend in carrying out both the plans which were the legacy ot his office, and others which he keeps on evolving from his own busy brain. But I am so fall of gossip that I quite forgot the plan. Here it is again. Let us start afresh.

THE THEATRE ROYAL. The performance of " The Silver King" at the Theatre Royal last night drew a house crowded in every part, and so great was the rush for admittance that numbers had to be turned away through want of room. The various scenes of the drama were highly ap- preciated by the audience, who were very liberal in their applause of the line acting of the principal characters. PRINCESS'S THEATRE. Giroflé-Girofla was repeated last night at the Princess's Theatre bythe Emelie Melville Comic Opera Company. Every part of the house was filled and the dress circle was crowded. The audience were kept in a state of continuous enjoyment by the pleasant, sparkling music of the piece, and the lively manner in which the performers rendered the numerous comic incidents and songs con- tained in it. THE OPERA-HOUSE. >, "Manteaux Noirs" was reDeated at this theatre last night, in the presence of an over- flowing audience, who were exceedingly liberal in their applause. BIJOU THEATRE. The powerful and realistic acting of Signor and Signoru Majeroni in "Jealousy" was witnessed hist night by a crowded assemblage of holiday spectators. TniO'OWN.HALL. At the Duvalli Shilling Concerts in the Town-hall las>t night there was a largely im- proved attendance, but nevertheless thus far the time seems to have been jil chosen fpr the presentation of musical cntertuinnients of this class with a view to attract general publie support M. Horace Poussurd, the distinguished bolo violinist, achieyed quite extraordinary success in pleasing his hearers. His first selections were " Une Plainte" and " Ronde do Nuit," the former being a moat xdiarming musical work in which'the pianoforte paxjt is very »i.ly ndele*gaxitly written M jrelli¡*thjíí.X4r the violin solo In tho " Ronde de Nuit" oc eura a woneleiful piece of bowing, of which wo have spoken previously. 'Hie audience were not to be contented with nnj thing less than an encore piece, which M. l'oussard gave them m an élaborât« and brilliant extract from the "Fantaisie Hon- groise" AllthrecpicceswereofM Foussard's own composition In the second part of the programme, the repetition of tho grand ttintasia, the "Scottish Carnival," aroused the audience to enthusiastic approval. 'I he broad humour infused by the player in tho old air, "lia, ha, the vvooin' ot' evoked peala of laughter 'lins special passage is, without exception, the cleverest in its way that vve have ever heard Another encore being greedily insisted on, the pla)cr treated his hearers to a brilliant performance of the air, "Toll the Bell," vvith vurmtions Hie other instrumental selections were per- formed b) Messrs llarcout Loe and Charles Sykes tit the pianoforte and Amcnc in organ rcspeetivel) these were the overtures to '"Hie Crown Diamonds," by Auber, and to "Norma,' by llellim These performances were in euch case well received, although they wcie open to improvement un re- spect to finish and îeflncment, Miss Rosina Caranthni sang with excellent eilcct the muBical scene, "Fly hence, each idle fear," fiom Wallace's opera " Matilda of Hungary " lho support rendered by M I'oussard's violin obligate accompaniment during this scene greatly enhanced the artistic value ot the performance Later in the evening tho samo lady sang "No, Sir," by Wukelield, and as an encore "DreamFaces," byUutcheson Mis Cutter sang, by request, "IlocLd in the Cradle of tho Deep," nnd Balfe s song " O take mo to thy heart again," und in each caso her admirable voice wir" heard to gie.it advantage Mr Armes Beau- mont was very woll received He was in admirable voice, and achieved distinguished success in each of his solos His name appealed for two songs on the programme, anil he san¿ three, namely, " My dearest heart,' by Sullivan , " Let mo Like a Soldier I all," Maritana, and "'loll me Mary How to Woo '1 bee, ' by Hodson, and was twice recalled after the latter performance Mr. B T. Moroney sang a very pathetic song, "Tho Auld Wife," by Phillips, and pleased his hearers so well that he had to sm¿ again His second song was Blumen- thal 8 composition, entitled "Life," a cha- racteristic work of the author, which Mr. Moroney renders in a highly artistic manner. Hie same gentleman, with Mr. Beau- mont, sang the duet, "I am th« King of Spain," from "Maritana," nnfi both gentlemen were associated with MirS. Rosina Carandini and Mrs Cutter in tt__¡| final quartet from " Kigoletto " In the pell formance of this, an apparently nnrohearsac, transposition led toa very slovenly effect I ft the accompaniment.
