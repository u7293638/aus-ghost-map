Spurgeon's Hell Lately a paragraph appeared dealing with the recent lapsing of the Methodist Church, which has been revealed by the statistics published in the pastoral letter, of the Wesleyan Conference. The remedy officially proposed for this lapsing was the more emphatic preaching of the great doctrine of repentance, and the inevitable punishment hereafter of the unrepentant sinner. It was suggested, in opposition to this view of the matter, that this very doctrine was the-cause of the lapsing. The logical outcome of this doctrine, is vividly expressed in the accompanying extract, which is from the second series of sermons by the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon. After a perusal of it, one is struck with wonder, not only that a man could in clude 'this view of things in a message purporting to be 'good news,' but that he should have been, for many years in the latter half of this century of enlight- enment, a preacher with all immense and enthusiastic following : — 'There is a real fire in hell as truly as you have now a real body — a fire ex- actly like that which we have on earth in everything except this, that it will not consume, though it will torture you. When though diest thy soul will be tor- mented alone — that will be a hell for it, but — at the Day of Judgment thy body will join thy soul, and then thou wilt have twin hells, body and soul shall be together, each brimful of pain, the soul sweating in its inmost pores drops of blood, and thy body from head to foot suffused with agony ; conscience, judg ment, memory, all tortured ; but more, thy head tormented with racking pains, thine eyes starting from their sockets with sighs of blood and woe ; thine ears tormented with ' sullen moans and hollow groans and shrieks of tortured ghosts,' thine heart beating higher with fever, thy pulse rattling at an enormous rate in agony, thy limbs cracking like the martyrs in the fire, and yet unburned ; thyself put in a vessel of hot oil, pained, yet undestroyed ; all thy veins becoming a road for the hot feet of pain to travel on ; every nerve a string on which the devil shall ever play his diabolical tune of Hell's Unutterable Lament.'
