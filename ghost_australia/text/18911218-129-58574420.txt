r CHAPTER 1. -There are few icenes' ir New Zealand mnre grandly I:tuged thanl the OhaIl Valiey, Taranaki; the u. nu where the volunteers had formed the bivouac, on the.24tlof Decemuber, in antieipl.tion of meeting thlu rebel Maorie. .It was ChristinasEve, the titme night; I with inouo alid ataris atuddine the dark blue canolipy of heaven, as on the night of the advent of the Mnaster, ntsrly nieteen hundred years ago. The lauji iius comiposeu d of six hurti dred, rank and file, of the AucklandI Mtilles, togfether with one troop of Carer- I sham'i Horse. H The latter had pitched ! their tents on a siiall hill adjacent to where thl Coominiesariat stores had beer. piled and covered over by a large tar Ipaulin. Of the sixty men of the troup ten had been told off as a guard, under the charge of Sergeant Exley. The supply of grog and provisions were only limitcd, and needed but one sentry at a time to keep watch and ward over them. There were six quarter casks of ruin standingin a row flanking tie stores,-a terrible temptation and dangerous in the extremo to any poor tippler who chanced to have cilarge in the still dead night with no eye looking on. This idea appeared to have taken pos session of thei sergeant, for he called ti?e guard together about the watch-fire, and said: " Corades, I need !narall remind you of the general orek, isutte this morning. Weo are under mirtial latw Ihere in the ,fiel.

' This experilent t with tile dog appeared equally interesting to another individual, via., a btre-l.egged MaI:uri lad about four teen, who stood by with tlouthiagape.

Tile Ilaori lad, protwlvnt about for soett place of shelter for the night, found a snug corner beneath the tarpaulin which covered the stores, and there retired to rest without Imore ado. The party round the tire gradually thifiined, until only two persons remained seo.ted by it,-Charles Stanton and Bob Cable. It was easy to perceive that a warm and sincere friendship existed be tweent e hese twain, y-t lio two melni were more opposite ill person and adisposition. Tihe one handsome, gentletnatly tnd re fined in bearing, but weak and yieldilng tu pusillanimity. The other coarse, plain of person, yet obstinate alnd detertamined as a bulldog. Hloe came these opposites to be friends? Simply through oll little act of kindness.

Silence teow reignit througlout tie camp, save for thte wild screech of the pelew out yonder by the lake. Santly, crouched utnder the friendly covering of tite tarpj.uli?. is suddentily ateakenied fiom his rosy dreams by the sound of voices it the vicinity. Tile Mtaori noiselessly lifts one cud of the cover ing and peeps fortri. Sergeant EUley is stamting with a lannikint in his ihand, ta:lsug to the sentry it a lo0w, earnest tulle. â€¢" Indeed, Charlie, I see no creart harm in t.aking a glass of grogt on such a cold nitght. We tare no, in town where it could be easily obt.ained, therefore one must get it by stealth. Of course you are on sentry, dald can preventt my taking anly, but I must say at small half-pint out of one of these casks would never be missed." Pl'erhiaps not," hnswered Charlie Stanton, carelessly. " Pray do as you please, you have command of the guard; but I saty, lExley, what about that lecture you gave us respecting genteral orders and Coloinel Ilartoppl stetlr discipline .?" T:e sergeant laughed in a iluiet way, and replied, " Wait until you're promoted again, Chlarlie, then adopt my plan. One sidle for ilh men, tile other, for your friends. Surely you were not impressed with may caution. Lord, I feel inclined to roar sttnetimes at all the fuss and humboug lunt forth in orders general or othterwise.

Tile otficer of the night begins his runids earlier that was expected. At three a.m. the coimissariat guard turned out at his sumnonl, and was dismissed as col rect. " lowi nmany satries have you, Ser geant Exley ?'" "Oilly one, capain !" " I will visit hit."
