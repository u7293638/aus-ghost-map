SPORTING NEWS. RACING NOTES. (BY FLANEUR.) A Jew and Gentile went into partnership, the Gentile found the money, ths Jew found the ex perience. At the expiration of three months the Semitic partner had the money and the Gen- tile bad some experience. This is as it was .at, Caulfield on the Guineas Day, and this is, I am afraid, as'it will be continued while racing lasts. The only race on which heavy preliminary bet ting had been done, that for the Guineas, was an absolute skinner for the children of Israel. This obnoxious habit .of rank., friendless .outsiders running away with races on which-large sums of money depend, knocks the tipster off his perch, and if he had only the smallest regard for the public welfare be would not get on it again. In the absence of fair play, tipping as a custom should be more honoured in the breach than the observance When the acceptances closed for - the Caulfield Cup, only 30 out of an entry of 137 remained in; this was at least a dozen under the number expected. Although not up to the ex pectation of- the club, the 1 30 will afford one of the finest races ever seen south of the line. With good going, the pace will be phenomenally : hot, and the finish phenomenally desperate, for with 1 the 500 sovs to the second horse and 200 sors to the third, the places will be fought out with determined energy. The .stake is such a rich bile that I expect to see a tolerably square race for-it, but there is nut the slightest, .doubt that at least 10 horses will go out, specially commis- - sioned to block the'favourites, Colstoun is at present the favohrite at 5 to 1, He touched 4’a on Monday night at which price his owner backed him in one hand to win £4OOO. Since then he has receded to 7’s but is now at s’s. -l am strongly 'of opinion that he cannot win, and if nty opinion was that he could win, I should still : feel that he would not be permitted to, and > consequently I dismiss him. Vergy, on the strength of a splendid trial, rapidiy went from ; 20's to 10’s, and is now second favourite. TO a galop was a good one, and he palled up as fresh ’ as a daisy and'as sound as a bell; 2 min. 47 sec, was the record for the mile and a half. As the track was heavy this was considered a good spin, but it is a long way from.being good enough to win the Caulfield Cup. If this is the best Vergy ban dp I fear he will run unplaced. This horse is a great favourite with the knowing ones, and a good many of the pencillers - have made their books for him. Fryingpan and Martini-Henri .are at 12’s. It was blazoned abroad yesterday that the Pan had split bis hoof, and would be a certain non-starter. Tbs following is bis record for a round after the:hoof splitting:—! min. sec. This is a better performanos than Vergy’s, and as the son of tbs' Saucepan has a brillliant list of victories'already compiled, as he is as fit as hands can make him,, as the distance suits him, and because he is as game as a pebble, I am unhesitatingly of opinion that what beats him will win. 9st 21b is a big weight, but I saw him romp home with lOst lib on his back about nine months ago, and his fettle is as good to-day as . it was then. Martini-Henry, with 9st 41b, if in his spring form, would be bad to beat, and as it is, must run very forward. ■ Malua, 9st 121 b, is one of the mysterious division. As this customer has won all bis races-with great ease,;it is really difficult to tell what weight would stop him if well and meant. Baplka. 'Sst lib,; and. Hastings, Bst 41b, are twO good'’uus when ’ thoroughly wound up, and should, both give a good account of themselves. In the light weight crowd there is nothing so well in as Yately, Norfolk, and The Agent, and any one of the trio may do the trick. If the weather was like that of the open ing day, the grey son of Warlike would • be ;my final selection. -Despot, who is to have the ser vices of Hales, is reported to be very, fit, but if there is any bad luck about during the progress of a race, this grey gets all his own and several other horses’ share.: On this score only, 1 can not stand him. Plying Jib is declared to be cherry ripe, and if so, he will run well, but judging by the display made by him at Ballarat, he must be out; of it. As the heavy weights have been getting a good ’ turn, I am disposed to believe that in this Cup. they will again demonstrate their superiority, and bar bad luck and accident, the winner should come from Martini-Henry, Fryingpan, Despot or Boolka, my cockboats being Yately, Norfolk, Agent.
