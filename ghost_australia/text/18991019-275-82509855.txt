CHAPTER II. "Will you come for a sail this evening, Nancy?" Rob asked at tea-time, two or three days after Nancy's return. "I should like it of all things," she said eagerly. "May I go, auntie?" "Of course you may, my dear; but you'd, better start soon and get back early,for I fancy the wind will rise at sunset;'' Mrs. Dennis answered, with a weatherwise eye on the sky. "Oh, Rob and I can manage to sail my namesake, even in half a gale," laughed Nancy, as she ran upstairs for her hat and coat. Mrs. Dennis came down, to the gate with them, and watched them lovingly as they went down the steep road, turning at the corner to wave their hands to her. "What a fine couple, they make, to be sure!" she thought. ''God bless them both!" Nancy felt that it was almost like old times, although Rob never used to help her over the stones then, as he insisted on doing to-day, and always used to let her help him run the boat down, whereas now he seemed quite ridiculously afraid that she might get her feet wet. As if salt water mattered ! It was these little attentions, with the shy deference that appeared in his manner towards her, that emphasised the difference between the old days and these; although he had not referred in any way to the earnest words he had poken during their homeward drive. In fact, this was the first time she had really been alone with him since then. She took the helm, as a matter of course, while he rowed until they were clear of the shore, and then shipped the oars and set the sail. It caught the breeze instantly, and the little yacht danced over the waters like a big white- winged bird. "This is glorious !" cried Nancy, with cheeks and eyes aglow, as Rob sat down near her. "You're steering straight for the sunset track, as you always used to do," said Rob, with a smile. "Yes. Do you remember, Rob, how you and I always used to think that the sunset made a path of gold leading to heaven, and if we could only keep in the track and go fast enough we should certainly see the shining city, even if we didn't reach it!" "Yes, I remember, but the sun always set too soon, and we had to go home over a grey sea, with all hope of seeing the shining city at an end for that day. What fanciful youngsters we were !" It seemed to Nancy that there was more than a touch of sadness in his voice. "Well, we were children, and we thought as children then; but now we have grown up we have put away childish things," said Nancy gently. 'We know that it's no use trying to get to heaven by sailing up the sunset track, but that the kingdom of God is within us, 'righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,' brought near us by Christ our Saviour." He looked at her sweet face, bright with the faith that was in her, and sighed again. "It may be near to you, Nancy, " he said sorrowfully. "Tis with you as with mother; it's all so real. You seem yo think of Christ, as of a familiar friend, always close to you, always caring for you " "I don't think I know," Nancy said. "It is a thing I cannot explain; I only know that it is true, as you will know some day." He shook his head. "I can't grasp it, Nancy. I've thought and thought, about it often enough ; sometimes I have felt, that I was getting to understand, just as we used to think we got glimpses of the city when the golden glow was brightest ; but it all faded and left me in the grey twilight alone. " There was a silence for a minute, and as they sped swiftly down the sunset track Nancy sent up a prayer from her heart that God would give her words that might help and guide her dear Rob. " Don't think me an atheist, Nancy, " he said earnestly. "I'm not that. I do believe in God, the Creator of all things. "The Lord is King, be the people never so impatient; He sitteth between the cherubim, be the earth never so unquiet." He raised his cap reverently and turned his face upward as he spoke. "That's just it," he continued dreamily. "We have to live out our lives and play our little parts here on earth, and God 'sitteth between the cherubim.' David knew, that, and Job, when ho said, 'How should a man be just before God?'' "Rob, dear Rob, you are wrong," Nancy cried. "Why do you take a half- truth and argue from it instead of taking the whole truth and believing it? It's true that none of us ourselves can be just before God, but, we are justified before Him by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who came into the world to save sinners. Rob, dear, it's all so plain if you will only try to see it. God sits 'between, the cherubim,' but He knows all our hearts. He humbleth Himself to behold the things that are in Heaven and earth.' He loves us so, loves you and me so much, that He sent His only begotten Son, that all who believe in Him-you and I, Rob— should not perish, but, have everlasting life!" They were both so engrossed that they had not noticed the dark clouds that were piling up to the north-west, stealing round and gradually blotting out the glory of the sunset ; or that the wind had suddenly dropped; and for the last few minutes the boat had been almost stat- tionary, the sail flapping idly against the mast. But just as Rob was about to answer, the boat gave a sudden lurch, and they both looked up. "The wind is changing," cried Nancy. "There's a squall coming," Rob exclaimed at the same instant, and sprang up to alter the sail. Nancy glanced over her right shoulder, and saw an ominous black shadow racing towards them over the water, and as it came the dancing, waves were converted as by a miracle into sullen grey rollers, crested with white. Rob had scarcely furled the sail before the squall was upon them, a shrieking wind and a rush of heavy rain. The boat shivered and plunged like a horse suddenly struck with a spur, and bounded forward. "We must run before it," shouted Rob his voice scarcely audible in the sudden din. He had seized the helm and it took all his strength to bring the boat round, for she was nearly broadside on when the squall struck her. " It won't last long," he cried, reassuringly, as they dashed along. They had weathered worse squalls than this in the old days. But as the darkness fell the squall did not pass ; the wind and the sea were rising every minute, and' there seemed overy prospect of a "dirty night." Rob's face grew white and anxious as he saw matters getting serious. It was impossible to set any sail ; the attempt would have capsized the boat at once, as he knew well enough. " Will you take the helm again, Nancy " he ecrid. " I must get out the oars." " It's no use," Nancy answered. " If we could bring her head round you could never row back against this ; we must be miles away from home." He knew it, and knew also that it was impossible for them to land elsewhere on that rugged coast' unless they could get into Bideford Bay and run for Clovelly; and that was a forlorn, hope, for they were being blown out to sea. However, he got out the oars, and in half a minute they were snapped and whirled away like sticks. A chill feeling of despair seemed to touch his heart as he crept aft again, and after groping for a tarpaulin, and wrapping it about Nancy (who, however, like himself, was already wet through with rain and spray), he took, the helm. It did not now require much effort to keep the boat's head straight. That was the only thing to be done, and he put his left arm round Nancy and drew her close to him. (To be Continued.) In the United Kingdom there are 2,000,000 females in excess of males, and 2,000,000 more males than females in the colonies. GOVERNMENT ADVERTISEMENTS WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS.
