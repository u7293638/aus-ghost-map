ECHOES OF MELBOURNE , ': J.-..ii.;i',ti!i!.-(Bx;THB. Ghost.) ,,:,.--. ....-i:- r lit is evident that in Parliament there is a generil agreement that the Coalition- has , putlive'd': its' usefulness, and that the Min istry 'of ' whioh the' Honourable. Duncan Gil , lies' is the1 head, will ere long be numbered /with 'the things of the post. The Govern ment appear to be fully alive tc their impending1 fate,' and are allowing their followers to become disorganised. As- a consequence the proceedings in the Assem bly partake largely of the character of a . 'go-as-you-please '?' contest; The obstinate attitude'of ; the Premier has again resulted ? in bringing defeat on his colleagues, and .alienating some of their most steadfast supporters. Even the Government whip, much to the astonishment and chagrin of Ministers, on Tuesday crossed the floor to vote against his employers— a sign that the «nd is not very far off. The Irrigation Bill is experiencing somewhat rough treatment in tbeCouhoil,' and when' it emerges' from : theUppei; Chamber will be very different in scope from what it was when first'subriiitted to the revision of the Upper Chamber. Indeed so; radical arethe changes made in the measure that it is not improbable tho Lower -'House Will refuse1 to accept the alterations', and in this event the bill will 'be shelved forth'e session.1 With its dis ' appearance ' ' from' ''? the ; stage,'. 'the' ration d etre of the Gillies-Deakin combination will also cease.
