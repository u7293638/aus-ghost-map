THAI* KNOWING G- B. 1HE ACTOR'S SONG. WHICH GR. B. was his name, And I will not deny, At the managing game That the old chap was " fly And he worked all the tiny-flute business In a way that looked rosy for " high." Each poor little mite 'Twas a pity to see, AB it twisted each night In the baby-bailee j But so long as it brought in the dollars 'Twas all right for that knowing G. B. " The play is a game At which I take a hand," Said G. B„ the same With the juvenile band ; " And I flatter myself that the babies Is a game that I do understand." Small " squeezers " his trumps In size very wee, Kids too young to play dumps His great card but a " three," If the little babes went*off their chumps That wasn't the fault of G. B. And men actors complain Unemployed they must be, And cannot obtain The dear £. s. d. " We are ruined by cheap Bijou labour Brought out by that knowing G. B." Which we don't think it right To tax juvenile brain, And doom a wee mite To a future of pain, Even though it may bring in the dollars— And that same we are free to maintain.
