ASHAMED OF ONE'S NAME. WHEN one starts in life his name is a more convenience, but not a symbol. It serves to distinguish between one man and another, and is, as it were, a handle by which we seise one man rather than another. Bat, in process of time, by the law of associa tion, we clatter aboat a aua'i name all the dr. eumetaness of his history, the elements of hit character, the prominent traits of his dupoci tion. Tb* Bam* becomes a history. The mo ment that it ia Bounded in oar eara we do not think of the name itself, bat of a life, per sonality, and eharaoter. In fret, the name » a portrait painted in letter*. What is •peeially curious is, that to itt wearer the name may sag feat one train of association, bat to all other* •Bother, a different and often oppognant idem. It would be a earioo* literature v one could pat in parallel line* what each man thought of him •elf and what other men thoofbt of him. Bat, it i* not • sputqlation of this kind that inspired me to begin thi* article. I have re j ecived a well-written note from a lady signed F. X. B.—that and no more. The request con tained was reasonable. The note was proper, j and everything aboat it was pleasing except the on willingness to gire her name. Was she ashamed of it? Or was it ait of modesty? Or was then some romantic sensibility aboat it which men cannot be supposed to be one enoogh to appreciate? I have formed an inflexible rale that I will nerar read an anonymous letter containing on- UTorable matter concerning others. A§ soon as I see the drift of it, I send it where it be longs—into the Ire. Neither wOl I answer any letter which is anonymous, though its content* concern the person's own sett. Ho person should be »-uiwH of bis name. Ho person sboald ask for anything without being willing to take the responsibility of the request. The habit of standing up frankly to ones own actions, opinions, or feelings, and taking the proper personal raeponaibUity be longing to everything ooaeeniog his own per sonality, is manly and wholesome. If we were writing letters, like Lord Ohesterield, to » son, we should say, Never write any letter that you are unwilling to sign. If there) are rsaeone which »ake it improper for yoa to gire your nejne, then yoa shoald net write at aIL I will not say that there are never eases in which anonymoasness is permissible. But, they are rare and extreme eases. In general, it is a safe role of eondaet not to do anything to which one is unwilling to put hie name. A good name is better than great riches, The habit of acting in all things frankly, openly, ooungeeuarr, and of taking the eoneaquenees of one s thoughts and actions, "y*r"rt fail to result, m individuals and ia nommunitise, ia a high yd noble type of manhood.—HxnT Wuu> Bnom.
