CHURCH SERVICES. ST. PATL'S CHtERCH. Tlie Rev. E. A. Crawford, of Castlcmaine, preached at the above last evening upon " The Episcopal Office." Tlio epistles to Timothy and to Titus indicated, he said, tho principle of diocesan episcopacy. A bishop lias to rule a diocese. He is.to bo a "Father in God," not lording it over the flock but ruling tiiem gently and feeding them with divine teaching. A bishop lias to ordain, but he is to " lay hauds suddenly on no man," being careful as to the persons he entrusts with pastoral work and office. Ho has also to lay hauds upon the baptised that they may be confirmed in their faith and Christian life by the Holy Ghost. The late pastor of St. Paul's parish was to ho made a bisliop'next Tuesday. How is this done? Not by Government appointment, nor by election ; but by prayer and the laying on of hands of those who wero bishops before him. It is an event of special interest for three reasons. First, because there has never been an English episcopal consecration in Victoria. Secoudly, because there has never been a clergyman educated and trained in Australia raised to the episoopatc before ; and thirdly, because of the man himself. Young bishops arc no novelty in the Holy Catholic Church. Timothy is; enjoined by St. Paul to iet no man despise his youth. To-day youth is not despised. It is rather held to give an addi tional interest to high office. In Dr Green's case youth was combined with a pure com bination of qualities fitting bira for a leader. But we must not think so much of the man us to make us forgot the cause in which he is called to bo a leader. He needs our sympathy and prayer more than our congratulation and euloary. A time of trial is at hand for the church. Paganism is reviving after so many years. IVe need the best of men to be our rulers and guides.
