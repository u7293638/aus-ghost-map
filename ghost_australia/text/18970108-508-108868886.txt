Exhausted nature, however, at last gave way. and I was on the eve. of sending for a doctor, when a friend drew my attention ' to a remarkable cure of dyspepsia and nervous debility effected by Dr. WiUiams's Pink Pills for Pale People. I got some of the^pills.as an experiment, and at once pro ceeded to take them in ? accordance -with the printed instructions. - After a ; few days, and . before I had completed. the' flrst'bdx, I felt a visible improvement, . my appetite returned, and once more rood agreed with me. - I .continued staking' the pills, and am now happy to relate that I seem as well and strong as -ever, and have suffered no more ^Erom . that terrible indigestion.
