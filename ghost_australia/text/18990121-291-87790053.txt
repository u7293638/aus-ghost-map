HOW A BISHOP LAID A GHOST. I called one winter's day, writes the Bis hop of Ballarat in the current number of the ' Fireside,' while rector in a large parish of England, at the residence of a merchantâ€” a new and extensive house, elaborately fitted with gas stoves and brackets and all recent appliances. Upon being shown into the dining-room, where all the family were assembled, I at once saw that some thing was wrong. Soon the story was told to me. There was a ghost. It was be lieved a girl had been immured in the base ment of the next house, which was in the course of construction. ' Of course,' I said, ' you have communicated with the police?' ' Yes,7' was the reply, ' and a policeman is on duty to try and get at her. But it is no good.' The servants had all given notice, and nobody knew what to do about the ghost. 1 went down to where the noise seemed to come from, and, after returning, suggested that I should be al lowed to control the family domestics and house for half an hour. Permission was granted. I then had a talk with two ser vants. Afterwards, with the family, I went down to the cellar while the fearful groans were being uttered. ' Avaunt,' I cried, in a loud voice, ' Abracadabra, I charge thee to abate these wailings.' Slowly the noise died away. ' Aldiboron tophoscophormio!' I shouted again. ' Chrononhotonthologofi! Now hiise thy voice as loud as thou canst raise it.' Once more the groans waxed louder and louder, reaching such a climax tbnt my companions turned to bolt, but a loud peel at the door bell transfixed them with a midden terror. Then his lordship explained. The horrible cries were caused by the gas. A small piece of grit had got into the pipe, and the gas going over this had created the row, which, an the quantity turned on increased, grew in force. The servants had , at my request, first lowered all the lights, and, when I shouted the second time, turifod all on full, producing the distressing noise. The gasfitter soon removed the obstruction and nothing more was heard of the ghost.
