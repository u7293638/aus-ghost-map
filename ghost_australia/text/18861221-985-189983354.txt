It would hare been a hap pier •-erosion still if he could hare foattd hit P.icothy mloae in ber amber- tinted ; When CipUin Irton reached the door, ! he coutd see Mrs. Lennox. standing in ihe nr.dat of a email crowd of people, who ' all Beamed to be talking at once. By " bow '■ fetching*" she looked in her uli-pr-cray gown, with a huge bouquet of orchids, and that gray telle thing she had on Iter head I Was that a new fashion, Diet wondered, for women to wear bon net* at their own ** at homes!'" And there was that ass Shorthorn close beside her. with a particularly fatuous and c*» 5>v-ng expression on hit face ! It was 1 high time ha had written, Dick thought; it was high time be had cone. Why the f< U. w was far gone—over bead and ears ; Dick could eee that by the way he appro- j pmted Mrs. Lennox with his eyes. i Then one of the circle moved sway, j and Dorothy tamed and saw Captain | Irtott at the door. She looked as if she , had seen a ghost. Coming forward, ha j took her hand, and then he saw that something was wrong. Without a word she motioned him into an adjoining room , which for the moment was empty. | *' ti-vvi i*od she whispered, "why j have you come now ? I wired that yon were not to come, that it was too late. I w-n-u. too, bet you cannot bare got my letter." "• * T v> late," Dorothy ! what do yon meat-. Tear telegram said, * Do net (vow u»c late." Well, 1 started the next day.*" "• Poor Dick." she eaid at last, " what » dreadful mistake you have made 1 4 Do net c.>tae. Tee late,* was the message I went. Did you cot remember that there arc- no full-stops in telegraphy ? I was married an hour ago to Lord Shorthorn. Ctime in and let mo introduce you to my husband." And this was Dick Irton a little mistake. There are no full-stops in telegraphy, but when, ten minutes later, Dick saw Lord ami Lady Shorthorn drive off amidst showers of rice and slippers, he knew that he had had a moral full-stop which he would remember all hia life.
