''UP AM, NIGHT IN THE ASSEMBLY." (The Debato on Mr. M'DodbIcI'b Claim, From "Political Froth, by an Abstainer," in the Quetiutanier.) When, later in the evening, supply mi en tered upon, and Mr. Stewart moved the vote of £6000 to Mr. P. T. Maodonald, member for Blackall, the cork blow put and froth began to foam. Mr. Maimer waa up like a crocus in spring, and mentioned that so long as Mr. Macdonald remained a member of that House he would not vote him a shilling, lie sug gested tie withdrawal of the item. Several members of tho Opposition declared war, and Mr. Dickson defended tho actidn of the Go vernment. Not even the appearance cf that master of strategy intimidated tho Opposition, however. They did not quail, even though it was the Colonial Treasurer who spoke. On tho contrary, Mr. Walsh seized the moment to fling himself into the thickest of the fray, and taunted the Government with indelicacy in having endeavored to induce the member for Blackall to come and vote to order on occa sions. • Messrs. Murphy and Griffith explained that Mr. Macdonald had only failed to Bustain the verdict giving him the money owing to tech nical legal objections. The strange event of two lawyers talking with blasphomouB levity of technical legal objections (ailed to move the ob- j duracy of the opponents of the vote, and pros- i pects lookod cloudy far Mr. Macdonald. Mr. Jacob Low oame to the rescue. He beamingly informed the House that be would cordially support the vote. If it were passed, he had a email matter of £1000, which he would hope to get voted on the strength of the precedent. Instead of being mollified by this gratifying information, Mr. I'&lmer; abused the venerable and guileless member in a drond-! ful manner. He rowed to challenge his vote : on this motion* as he confessed to having a . direct pecuniary interest In fact, members generally failed to rise in the situation. In stead of adopting Mr. Low's idea, and agreeing to support the motion on the understanding that cach of them should in turn have £1000 or so voted in compensation for some claim or other, they fell upon Mr. Low tooth and nail as if he had said something ttrong in declaring his reasons for wishing the amount to be granted to his brother squatter.. Mr. Palmer, however, relented fiomewhal, ; and in lieu of opposing the vote Altogether, and bo leaving Mr. Macdouald destitute, ho offered i a rcductiou on the claim of £6000. Ho was . open to vote the amount less £6999 19s 9d— . available balance threepence! The Rouse ■ divided on this offer, ana while thirteen voted in favor of it, nineteen were exorbitant find didn't think it enough. Mr. Morehead outbid hi* chief in generosity, , and offered sixpence, and Mr. Walsh produced himself in the ouw character of a peacemaker, deplored the probability of an acrimonious debate, and proposed that as there was not a ghost of a chance of the item passing, it should be postponed, bo that the business of the country should not be sacrificed to the in* tousls of an indindnil. i*Tho Hous* would have none of bit advice, and adjourned for lea minutes to recover frflja thp. jMlonishment which overpowered tbel&M; Seeing him figure as peace-maker. On the Te&umptioa; of the Bitting, Mr. WaUh's appeal by taking op the parable and treating the Opposition to a homily in bis best manner, which in turn was ruined by Mr. Mnerossan, who immediately capped ft with another in precisely the same style, twt Addressed to the Government, which had the effect of burlcsqueing Mr. Douglas' nlos spocch. At this point it dawnod upon somebody that when Mr. Morgan had vaoatod the chair, ioft before, the Committee was io division, and ha4 never got out of it. The dilemma was die* cussed in a chcerful and uuemborassed spirit. Mr. Morehead giggled all the way back to "the Long Parliament for precedents of the Chair' man's conduct And found no comfort, Mid the Chairman explained that on putting the ques* tion Mr. Walsh was the solitary No, and as the division was about to be taken, that member had himself remarked thiit be supposed it was an good as settled agninst him, 60 (bat he (th» Chairman) suspended the division. This nU, tlie Chairman, with a defiant glare at Mr. Morebead and others who bad questioned hi* right to leave the chair, again vacated it Five-aud-twenty minutes elapsed before h* resumed his scat, when Mr. Douglas writwdf resumed the argument as to hjs right to desert the chair, end moved that the pout be referred to the Speaker, Iievity* Vanished and sevonl members dressed down. the unlucky Chairman, who, I hear, had been bouncing Out side that he could leave the chair when be pleased, and ehould too; and the Speaker raid that he couldn't, except by consent, whereupon Mr. Morgan, somewhat crestfallen, roseatod himself in his prison, and proceeded with the division, in which the motion for adyoniraeot was negative. <■* At this point the Premier went on a foraging expedition, and returned with Us •ptfu, a bolster, which ho carried to the b&ok; benches, where ho stretched his manly form andsonght repose; but exhibited come alarm when Mr. Foote «ou£ht refuge on the same bench, which of so muchintellwt.
