SI'DNEY COLLEGE nEXAM1fNAT1Oy. Perhaps a more flattering scene to all partlescOon cerned, has never been witnessed in this Colony than that which took place last Thursday,. at the ( Sydney College. It heing- the first- examiration t they have eve- had since their castallishment, it \--created nosmall excitement among all who are interested in the ,otion---f -rCoo utli, .:as maybe inferred, from the rank and character of the visitors. bhe. Governor and Captain. Hunter mnade their appearance at an early hour, and com- g . icnced operations immediately, and long as, it t * must Iaive been -since His -Excellency was at at hoio, ia nevertlkeleas he had his Latin and Greek quite at II command; as a proof of which, the b ok was s never out of his hand for full"three hours. Col Wilson also was -quite at home, for he took the ' Frenchkdepartntent entirely on himself ; and in the end,-;.qoanplimented Mr. Stanley on the progress his pupils ha 1 made in that branch of their study But what created the greatest surprise to the Chief t Justices was, the mathematical knowledge displayed I by .one of the pupils of the second mtasterhMr a AMurray ; this was-a boy n med Martin, not fifteen a Syears of age, and the profundity which he showed in that branch was such, that His Honor was very inquisitive as to his whole history ; the well-exe w cuted map of the world would not have been men tioned, had not Major Mitchell on seeing it, made lim a present of one of his own luaps of the t Colony, in compliment to the performance; but a such a generous encouragement ought not to be overlooked. His Lordship, the Catholic Bishop was also in attendance-and before we quit this patL of the subjects it may be observed, that he a and the Governor were much gratified at the pro -fciency-the-eldeFstsQn of the Major displayed. Mr. I * Banfather's classes also did him uuchli credit; the I greater part of them were boys who had corn m smenced their Latip and Greek studies utder his tuitioici; but the greatest eulogium that can be bestowed upon him will be to quote Mr M'Encroe's wprds td Mr. Cape respecting hini t he said,? he I had never known boys in atll'his experience, do so i much in so short a time." 'The only. thipg that was omitted, and it could tlly be owing J to the pressure of business on hand, teas. that there were no specimens of penmanship displayed Now, in -a mercanctile country like this, so far from being neglcated, it ougltt to form a lending feature in our schools. Mr. O'Brien, the fourth mnaster (to menion' them in rotation), convinced the com' pany that he had drilled his pupils -well at their tables. The Governor on leaving, was saluted with a '' three times three," which had no stnall effect- in so spacious and lofty a room.
