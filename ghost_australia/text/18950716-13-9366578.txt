TUESDAY, JULY 10, 1895. Two striking statements came from the Labour Comet last week One is that '"the farmers are being driven " out of the country in shoals " The other is, " Melbourne is losing its " position of prominence and import " ance in the southern hemisphere " These awakening allegations came from Mr LonGMORE (Hansend, pago 892), and they were duly applauded by his Corner friends, and they challenge at tention now that the House is about to resume its tariff work The member for Dandenong can speak with authority about the farmers, who, he says, are beginning to clear out for New South Wales. His suburban allies know all about the depression in the metropolis As a rule there is some exaggeration in the Corner allegations, the gentlemen of that region being accustomed to over colour their pictures, but in this instance the speaker is right Everyone knows that he is As Mr Longmore says, we are driving our farmers from the land Is that " encouraging native "industry" We are imperilling what ought to be the impregnable position of Melbourne Is that the way to build up trades? And what special work have we been engaged in to drive farmers from this country to other lands and to force people from Melbourne to other cities? The reply is that we have been piling up our tariff Low prices do not account for our relative retrogression, for the low prices are operative every where Neither does " high interest for a man does not escape existing Australian interest arrangements by crossing the Murray His special work in which we have been engaged the work which diQeicutiatos us from our neighbours, which accounts for the depression being more severely felt here than in the adjacent states is that we have raised and raised our duties, not for revenue purposes, but in order to destroy interchange, and thus to depreciate the value of our own produce and to cut into our own profits The Tariff Reformers largely rest their case on the necessity of turning the products of this country to the best account They do not desire to argue any particular theory, but they seek by a vigorous effort to put Victoria on the upward grade, and this they say can only be done by giving fair play to her native industries We have to put the people on the land and to keep them there, and land Reformers declare and believe that the only way to keep the people on the land is to make farming pay We have to make agriculture pay, horticulture pay, and gold mining pay If the High Tariff people can supply a local market for all the produce and all the gold we can raise in Victoria well and good, but notoriously they cannot Notoriously our gold goes to Europe, and notoriously our most, our wool, our wheat, our fruit, are likely to go in over increasing quantities What is the use then of the High Tariff! people over denouncing our " foreign trade," when, whether we like it or not, we have to live by that foreign trade-when, as every man who is not an idiot sees, our immediate future depends upon how far we can extend our foreign trade, and how far we can make a profit out of it? The more profit there is to be made out of that trade the more money there is to be spent in this colony and the better the situation is for all, from the banker to the beggar, from the lady in her silks and her carriage to the widow in rags and in tears It is useless for the High Tariff people to say to the producers of this country, " You have no right to buy where you " sell Hang your profits, they belong to us " Undoubtedly the task of the day is to revive our native industries So much all will admit, but no place has been more abused than this one of " native industry It has been wrested from its obvious and honest meaning, and has been used in the interests of every monopolist with a stone to make an artificial or a rotten trade pay by levying contributions on the taxpayer Spoliation, however, has been pushed too far People are now realising that a native industry is one that does crops the resources of the country, and that trades that require 40, 50, or 100 per cent as a subsidy to pay them for working up raw materials are not native industries, but are parasites living on the real native industries and enfeebling them 'the more of such demands, the less the native industry can develop If we revive our national and native industries who provide for a maximum of work in those occupations, and we enable them to provide for the maximum of employment in the minor or dependent trades 'lines all round maximum employment is the great object to be kept in view It is the care of sweating, for there is no sweating when the demand for labour is brisk, whereas when labour is eagerly demanding work harvesting cannot be prevented, for labour swoatB itself Every Highland duty that is reduced helps to revivify our native industries, and brings us nearer to the maximum employment stage In all parties there will be waverers, the faint hearted or the half convinced, but in this instance the more Tariff Reformers consider the position the more resolute they should be to press on The appeal made to them by the other side is to personal pity and is that here and there some particular act ' ficial trade, already sweated and both gazed, may suffer further hardship by a reduction of duties But it must be re I membered that the more the duties are reduced all-round the more those very trades share in the general benefit small reductions here and there may occasion general irritation and indi actual loss, but given substantial all round reductions and the individual finds his compensation in the increased prosperity of the community. It is a maxim of the courts that to consider had cables is to make bad law In those matters the greatest good for the greatest number is the only possible rule leaving hard cases when they can be proved to be individually coupon saved It is much better, moreover, for substantial reductions to be made to day, the industry then to conform to stable conditions, than it is to make paltry reductions to day with the certainty that the settlement will be destitute of any element of finality, and that another tariff jtiugglomust immediately follow It is good for us to make Victoria the most prosperous and the most progressive of the Australian states It is bad for us to be the least prosperous and the least progressive We have enormous advantages, entitling us to the Australian lead Victoria should be the golden and Melbourne should be the point and the capital of the continent, and the folly which would throw those advantages away is little short of crime Can Melbourne as a port hold her ev n rude- I DO per cent i me as against ports with 10 percent duties which duties may disappear 1 Do our producers, who have both to buy and to sell, gain by severe restrictions being put on their operations These are the questions to be answered, and as the member answers them-as he has promised his constituents to answer them-so should be vote He should vote, not as a prohibitionist, not as a freetrader, but as a patriot Political affairs in the United Kingdom have become unusually interesting Apart from the actual contest in the electorates, which has begun be favour ably for the Unionists, we may call attention to the two programmes which have been submitted to the voters by the opposing lenders who situation is peculiar, and in some respects without a parallel The two I opposing parties are appealing to the country with different sets of measures, both of which may equally claim to be called by that vague and much abused term " liberal " The electors are required to answer the extremely knotty and perplexing question, which is Codlin and which is Short ? Lord Eosi BLUY and Sir Willi m Hah court, and adhering faithfully' to the platform which they failed to carry in the last Parliament the leading members of the late I Ministry differ, indeed, considerably among themselves as to the relative values to be assigned to the various items of their programme Mr John Morley adjures the Liberals to place Home Rule in the forefront of the battle, while Lord Rosebery declares that reform of the House of Lords is the primary question for the electors to decide upon In the meantime Sir William Harcourt, who has never been suspected of such depth of conviction and earnestness of purpose, has been stumping the country in the interests of the Local Veto Bill, and he asserts that to secure the adoption of this measure is now the sole remaining object of his life 'J here is something pathetic in such declarations, which seem to speak from a politically broken heart, and to really conceal a despair that the object of such a life s devotion will ever be attained Mr GudbTOVe, it will be remembered, consecrated the remainder of his days to carrying Home Rule for Ireland But, however much the leading members of the defeated Ministry may differ among themselves as to which is their most important measure, the one likely to appeal most strongly to the great heart of the people, they have all agreed to go to the polls with the three measures named, to gether with disestablishment of the church in Wales and Scotland and the " one man one vote' principle This programme possesses two or three noteworthy features The first is that it contains no measures of really constructive legislation, no proposals for dealing with the poverty and misery that are such a painful feature in English society, and the mitigation if not the eradication of which is the aim of philanthropists and the dream of on thusiasts No concession is made to the rising tide of Socialistic feeling, which, however misdirected it may be, has for its basis a sincere desire to improve the condition of the masses Three of the measures Home Rule 1 one man one vote and reform of the House of Lords aim merely nt making constitutional changes, alterations in the machinery of government, while the two disestablishment bills are purely destructive measures which can in no way affect for the better the well being of the poorer classes who Liberal party is, in fact carrying-out the Trade tional policy of the old fashioned 'W hig3 and Radicals, who seemed to think that the end and men of colour was to extend the franchise and sweep away some of the ancient institutions of the country It proposes, in short, to confine itself to purely dest active legislation and to measures for tinkering the constitution Another striking feature is that the various schemes put forward by the Liberal party appeal to Sectional rather than to national interests the programme, as was obvious during the last Pin liament, was devised with the object of satisfying this and that suction of the supporters of the Ministry the fate of the Home Rule Bill showed that outside Ireland there was no enthusiasm for the measure 'the disestablishment bills aiOBops to the Nonconformists, just as the Local Veto Bill is to the temperance party with regard to the " One man one vote " Bill, there is too much reason to believe that it was brought forward rather in the supposed interests of the Liberal party than as part of a carefully considered scheme of I electoral reform On turning to Lord Suisiiury1. programme we find that it includes proposals to which the title liberal can hardly be refused they are memories that aim at ameliorating the condition of the working class by' providing for the better housing, com ! pensation for those who sustain injuries for which the employer is not liable and enabling them to purchase free' holds for themselves An attempt is to be made to relieve the depressed concli tion of the agricultural interest, in cluding both the farmers and the labourers, while the commercial classes are promised that fresh markets will be opened abroad Uns programme is undeniably an attractive one, though some doubt may be felt as to whether all the schemes proposed are practicable It may, perhaps, be thought that the platform has been adopted chiefly with the object of " dishing the Whigs, to use the expression applied by Lord Derby to the Reform Bill of 1867, but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that the proposed legislation is of a kind that has long commended itself to the more advanced section of the Conservative party, include" such statesmen as Lord BEicovsnrLD and Lord Randolph Churchill, Besides, the adoption of a liberal programme was inevitable if the co operation of the Unionist Liberals was to be secured, and such an alliance is still regarded as indispensable for maintain- ing the unity of the kingdom and opposing a barrier to revolutionary projects 'the influence of Mr On when LAIN is plainly visible in the legislation announced by Lord Salisbury and Mr. B via our Some dissatisfaction may be felt by the ult Conservatives at the deference shown by the Prime Minister to the member for Birmingham, but the bulk of the party know well enough that the days have gone by for mere assistance to change, and that if they are to compete on equal terms with the Liberals for the storage of the working classes they must come forward with something more than a mere negative policy It seems likely enough that the artisans and agricultural labourers will prefer Lord Salisbury's proposals to those of Lord Rosebery 'they firmly believe that legislation is capable of doing something to improve their position, and they may think that the half loaf offered by the Conservatives 13 bottortlnn the no broad of the Liberals Strathroy years during which the Glad stone Rosebery Ministry hold office were bad run of social legislation, all the time of the House being spent 111 fruition wrangling over measures that the country did not want and that there was not the smallest chance of passing It may well be that the maloney of the electors will conclude that the Liberals having had their chance and failed, there can be the harm in giving the others a to nil During the last quarter of a century the pendulum has swung from one side to the other with romarkabloicgulanty, and those who have carefully studied " political meteorology " in England seem to think that the time for another swing has arrived The results of the earlier elections, reported during the past few days, confirm the forecast, and it is now more than probable that the Conservatives and their allies the Unionist Liberals will have an opportunity of carrying out their scheme of social legislation, an experi- ment that will be watched with scarcely less interest in this part of the world than in the United lung area Apart from the unique chnractoroftfio entertainment to be opened by HisEi cellency the Acting Governor in the 'town hall this afternoon, every visitor will enjoy the privilege of contributing to the Tucker Village Settlement Board when assistance is much required We have already shown lion in their 7111 cocoa!
