A COLONIST AT ST. PAUL'S, c A new sensation has been discovered by a contributor to- Chambers's' Journal— or perhaps it. wonld"bo better to .say that the sensation was forced upon him. He ;hnd never seen the interior of St, Paul s Cathe dral, rind, it being his last evening in Lon don previons to his return to Australia, he prevailed upon a grey-headed old maD, 8o.he says, to' let hiin into tho building when the shades of evening had gathered around it. The colonist, who was left in tho building alono, saw a few feet from the floor — not a ghost — bnt a rope dangling -from the vast eight above, and having been a famous gym nast in years gone by, ho caught hold of it and found himself drawn np, of coarse, to to his great horror. Soon he almost lost pos session of his senses and his strength, expecting every moment to bo dashed to pieces. Ultimately he became unconscious, and -when he ''.came to," he found himself on the floor, with his grey headed friend bending over him. It appears that the old man returoed just in timo to see the hero of this startling episode dangling in tho air, that he whistled three times, jnst as he had ob served. tho workmen did when thoy wanted tho rope lowered, tho pulling up stopped, and the rope came down, tho colonist holding ou till it nearly reached the floor again. If the story is not true, it might bo. Moral : When you go into St. Pdnl'B and see a rope swinging from tho roof, don't practice gytn- nasticB upon it.
