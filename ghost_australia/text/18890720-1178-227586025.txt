A GHOST AT GERMANTON Some Sublunary Spirit. ; Way up nenr Cermanton, in tho Albury district, tho . residents wero startled last week by a ghost story. Tho local corre spondent of the Albury Mail gives the fol lowing version of the vision : â€” On Friday nignt last, us a gentleman weu-iinown Here was roturning to the township by a lonely road, ho was greatly startled by the sudden appearance of a man onhorseback who seemed to arise out of a neighboring dam or water-' iioiu, itmi ui lui iiiiu i uau uy wniuii no was proceeding disappeared in a mysterious manner. The same unearthly visitant is re ported to have been seen by two old residents of the district sonio 18 months ago, and who are prepared to vouch for the accuracy of their statement, so much so that neither care to pass that way after nightfall. In botli cases the ghostly visitant is said to he riding a grey cob. That some discontented' spirit is dissatisfied with his mode of exit from this sublunary sphere is ovideut, but why bring the spirit of his horse ? Why not let the spirit of his Bucephalus rest in the happy hunting ground? But perhaps tho hoi-BO wishes to gaze on the pastures where once lie fed. It is said that one or two von- turosome individuals purpose interviewing his ghostship.
