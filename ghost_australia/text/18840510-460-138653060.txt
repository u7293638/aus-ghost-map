ELSTEBNWICK-PABK MAY UEETnra SATURDAY, HAT 3. A fine day and a diversified programme attracted more than (he average number of visitors to Elatern wick-park on Saturday last The grand stand was well filled, and we were gad to see a goodly number of ladies among the occupants. The erection of a judge's box on the stand side, and the addition of a dock to the stand on the opposite side of the track, were among the numerous improvements effected since Mr. Haydon took office. The business of the day rned with the match between Messrs. G. Dixon's and F. Robbing's pair-horee teams. This ended rather unsatisfactorily, lor Mr. Robbins's young horse Bparrowhawk kept breaking badly, and as Mr. Dixon's pair trotted well together, they passed under the wire when their opponents were on the other (ride of the three-quarter pole, or over a quarter of a mile behind. There was a good deal of interest in the free-for-all contest, as the two American cracks, Honesty and Len Rose, were among the starters, and many were anxions to see bow the colonial-bred Leithamstead would shape alongside them. Honesty was in eplendidfcondition, and was made first favourite. He jnstified the confi dence of his friends by going to the front «oon after thestett, and winning with e*8e. Oliver once or twice got on terms with him, bat the pace soon caused the gelding to break tip badly, and Leithamstead, trotting jrith his customary consistency, gained second money. Len Bose did not appeario be in his beet , form, and was distanced, Only Tnlta and Calomel same to the poet for the Two-y^r-old Selling Race, andodda 4 were i*m on the former, who sever ewvehia irta chance, and won as oe pleased; on Calomel lly, On lto was eold to 'wd "le Race, avionr. set-to Sir WHIrsns Clarke's grey von by & head.
