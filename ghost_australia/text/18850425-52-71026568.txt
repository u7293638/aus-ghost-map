MITTAGONG. April 21. The committee appointed to carry out the recent banquet to Mr. O'Byrne, school inspector, called on Mrs. O'Byrne a few days ago, and presented her with several beautiful pieces of plate as a token of esteem from friends in many parts of the district. IN THE FASHION.-Like all other loyal Austra lians, weare preparing to give the Russians a warm reception. We are to have a troop of Light Horse and a Volunteer Infantry Com's; Sixty persons have signed a requisition for each company. COLO VALE.- I am sorry to say the boring opera tions at Colo Vale have been brought to a stand for j " : the pr√©sent. At 750 fee^T the rods got jammed, and have not been put right. This hindrance was all tho moro disappomting from the fact that there were indications that within another hundred feet or so a good seam of coal might be met with. 'FOREST DEVHI.-Yesj sir, we have a real forest \- devil. None of your midnight ghosts that are more shy than comets, but a omature that can be seen at ? -midday. It is a machine which Mr. Sheppard is using to pull up trees. Ono man can exert the strength of one hundred and eighty men, ^ Mr. Sheppard says he can pull up more trees with it in a day than six men oanjiallin'a week, in the ordinary way. So that even a devil may be of some use in the world.
