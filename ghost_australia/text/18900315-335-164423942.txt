OXE WAT TO DETECT A THIEF. 'I'll tell you howl ran down a thief re cently,' said the man in the Lewiston police station. I lost SOdoL in money. I did not say a word. I did not even tell my wife. I hardly told myself. .The other day, two years after the occurrence, a woman in my neighbour hood said: * By the way, did you ever nnd out who stole your SOdoL' I looked her in the face and said, ' I never had until just this minute.' She turned as pale as a ghost, and the result was that she paid me 80doL and interest on the same for two years.'
