VICTO lil A. I [From the Melbourne journals.] The intercolonial delegates had a lengthened sitting on Wednesday, and transacted a considerable amount of business. A joint answer to Lord Kimberley's celebrated despatch was agreed upon, and will most probably be transmitted by the outgoing mail to England. The border duties were further considered by the delegates, and consideration was also given to the laws at present relating to absconding debtors and deserters of their families, who now found that a trip across the Murray quite relieved them from their responsibilities. It was considered desirable that some steps should be taken to remedy such an evil, but nothing definite was agreed upon. An adjournment for one hour and a half was made during the sitting to allow of the Sydney delegates attending a breakfast given in their honor at Scott's Hotel. At the conclusion of the sitlingitwasjdecide that the delegates should meet again at ten o'clock on Friday, in order to bring the business of the Conference to a conclusion. The principal item now remaining for consideration is that of the border duties, with regard to which something definite will be decided upon on Friday, as the delegates have announced their intention of leaving Melbourne for their homes on Monday next. Immediately after the sad accident which occurred at the Haymarket Theatre on Saturday morning last, and by which a man named Jones lost his life, a subscription was set on foot among the company at the Princess Opera House, by which a sum of ten pounds was obtained. Mrs. Gladstane headed the list with three guineas ; the remainder was made up by the members of the company. The ship Hydaspes, that arrived on Tuesday night from London, while off the island of Maderia caught twenty-seven turtle, twelve of which are now on board in a healthy condition. In the hope that they will abound in Hobson's Bay, Captain Babot intends to hand them over to the Acclimatisation Society. His kindness it is to be hoped will prove successful. The Ballarat Star' states that Mr. Montgomery was in the habit of taking doses of hydrocyanic acid on certain occasions when his nerves were unstrung, It is thought his death might have been occasioned by an overdose of this medicine. Parliament is likely to be adjourned in the first week of November. A gentleman who was a passenger on board the Avoca on her last voyage to Ceylon thus relates the circumstances of the unfortunate accident which caused the death of Mr. Shafto Robertson, the actor : " On the 23rd of August, the first warm day we had, the ship was opened for ventilation, hatches were taken off, and engine-room sk) light opened. A group of actors and actresses belonging to the troops bound for Calcutta were standing by the skylights of the engine-room laughing and joking, and Lewis was just giving out to them their parts to study for an early representation, when poor Shafto Robertson, who was chatting with Julia Edouin, was apparently leaning back to a roll of the ship, when he overbalanced himself and fell down into the engine-room. The engines in this ship have in vi ted cylinders, he consequently did not fall into the machinery, but on to the cylinder cover, from which he was taken off insensible. In thisstatoholny for about 36 hours On coming to himself he appeared at first to be doing well, but the last few days has suffered from continual fits, and appears to be gradually passing away The affair has cast a great gloom over the ship for he was very much liked by all on board " A Postscript to the letter adds "Poor Robertson died last night, and was buried with the usual service at sea this morning (a plumber and " the star of Bendigo is still in the ascendant No less a sum than £10,011 was paid in dividends during the last week.
