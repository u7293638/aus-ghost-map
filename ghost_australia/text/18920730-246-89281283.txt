To the Editor of the Express. Smr,-I have read with very great care the letters of one Peter M'Cluskey; also two signed "One of your Readers." I took the trouble to submit Mr. M'Cluskey's first letter to Roman Catholic clergy men, who approved of it, and pronounced it true doctrine. Roman Catholics are not a bigoted people, as "One of your Readers" makes it appear. He has been injuring our cause very much in the eyes of the people. We wish to live on friendly terms with all men, whatever religious differences may be amongst us, and work together for the general good of our adopted country. Mr. M'Cluskey's answer to the "sin against the Holy Ghost" was correct according to the interpretation of one of the ablest of English Cardinals. The words "double dealers and hypocrites" are also Catholic according to Challoner on "Receiving the Holy Spirit," and may not allude to any particular person or persons. AntIA' IV.
