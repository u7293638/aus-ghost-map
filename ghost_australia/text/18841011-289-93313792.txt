The history of the Vletorian Amateur Turf Club is interesting as showing \- what : was started originally as a semi-jiriYate elnb by a few wealthy young men, has grown, into on important racing body .by the aid Of , the .general public It was somewhere .about 1875 that the Messrs. -Heotor and Barman Wilson, M. Bender, and the -'him. sides; and others made arrangeinents.witb the Ballarat Turf Club for the me of their course! at.Dqwling Forest for the purposes of -a race meeting at which gentlemen or amateuwoniy could ride. The principal event was the Victoria Gold Cup, a welter handicap steeple, -chase. Some time afterward* ihe club was established on a broader basil, anda course at Caulfteld was secured. Built was no* til the present secretary, Mr. N. R. D. Bond .{formerly sporting editor of the Leader), took affairs on hand that the dub made -any very great headway. We find the first race for the*Caulneld Cup, of 200 aova, with sweep of 10 sovereigns, one mile and a half, ^ was on April 5, 1S79, won by A. CbirBside'sKemniaister, SBt.lOlb. ; Levant, 7\. Gt. 7 lb., second; Mountaineer, 7 at 13 lb., third ; fifteen starters ; time, 2 mln. 45^ sec On April 17, 1880, the conditions of the Cup were altered to 100 «ovs., \- witfi , sweep of 5«9oys., about one mile and a quarter ard a .distance. This was Jwon by T. Jpnts's Tom Kirk, 8 at. 3 lbs. ; Robbie Burns. 6 st 8 lbs., second; and ?Timothy, 7 St.: 9 lbs., third ; twelve starters. Time, 2 min. 2S?- sees. In the followinjE year we find fhe Cup is of 125 sovs., with sweep of 3 eovs.i came distance as previously, won by H. Teend's Blue Bibbon, 7 st 3 lbs. ; Robbie Burns, 7 st. 5 lbs, second; Aspen, 3 st, 3 lbs,, third ; fifteen starters. Time, 2 mln. 30 sees. In 18S1 there was a second Cauldeld Cup run in October, of 300 sovs,, with sweep of 10 sovs., one mile and a quarter and a distance; won byT. Ivory's Blaster Avenel, 7 st. 12 lbs. ; Pirate, 6 st, 9 lbs., second ; Suwarrov, S st. 10 Iba., third; seventeen Btarters. Time, 2 mln. 29iseea. On October 7, lSb2,tbeCapwaa for^OOsovs., with sweep of IU sovs. 1 added, and gold trophy-value 200 sovs., distance one mile and a half, won by Branch's Little Jack (G at 11 lbs.), Verdure (6 at. 11 lbs.) second, Gipiy Cooper (7 sVll lbs.) third; thirty-two starters : time, 2 inin. 41i sec, Oa October 20, 16S3, the conditions 01 the cup were1 the. same as in the preceding year, and the event was won by Wallace's Calma (S st. 2 lbc.),£tockdale -8 st. 7 lbs. second, Anglesey (Sst) third; twenty-five starters; time, 2 min, 42 sec. This year Mr. Bond has fol lowed Mr. Barnard's'exMnplG, and on the lines of the Sandown Park people hat organised a race to which -owners have to contribute somewhat largely, but the conditions of which are *cry pupiiim, -uiwiiuuuu us x*ow auvs, naa a gold eup value 200 sovs. will go to the winner; 5C0 sovr. to the second horse, and 2C0 sovs. to the third horse' There were 137 subscribers who paid 5 sovs. each on nominv tion, June 2; alter weights were declared 5 BOvs. more were payable August 4, and a third pey ment of 5 sova, on September 1 ; all horses left in alter that date being considered as in tbe race ; but a final payment of 15 sovs. each is due en October 14 (four days before the »ce),sothatstarterswill have paidSOiO vs. each. At the present tune there are sixty-nine horses left in the race, but it may fairly be estimated that not more than half this number will go to the post. There are so many hones who -c&n; compass a mile-and-a-halt in about 2.44 that it is a difficult matter to estimate what ore actually out of a race of this description. The course is an awkward one, but last year the race was won by the favorite Calma, who started at the short odds of 4 to L The fol lowing tables are worth etudjing by those who are interested : — CoiirAEATivE Table of Caulfield Cur a:nt» WF.rfiMT PHR.AO.E Imports. :no«e. jAge.^^iDUr^ce !yrs. 1st. lb. j st lb.

It would be a tedious task to wade through the performances of all these horses, or even the majority of them, but those most in favor . and who have been supported in the betting market are Fryingpan, Pioneer, Meteor, Hastings, Bapid, Battailous, Yately3 Silver King, Capri, Conjecture, Malua, Privateer, The .Agent, Colstoun, Camerlne, Victress, Marcrjey, Ironmaster, Boolka, Signor, Clap trap, Ned o' the Hills, and Helene. Of these we like beet Hastings, Capri, and Frying fak, and believe that Ned o' the Hills and Conjecture will both be dangerous .if sent for this event. The Guineas will be run for on Saturday, October 11, when the V.A.T.O. meeting will be opened. Last year, it will be remem bered, tbe Guineas were won by Mr, James Aldridge's b.c.

Kufus ran second in the Second Juvenile Stakes at Caulfield, and won the V.B.C, Knrsery Handicap, beating Xantipp 9, Vf »ejia» andLotbers. .

Qrata tude, the.S.A. J.C. Derby winner, mustba held in respect, from the easy way in which she put down her: opponents in that event, ssd because she is ? strong, welltmade filly. The distance will suit her, and she. ought to- be nearer the-jndge at the fiofch than almost anything else in the race. Helene has not only : Her own reputation but that of her brother Assyrian, the Melbourne Cap winner, .to. make her regarded - as a racehorse. She is very handsome, and a grand mover, but she oould not -travel in the Derby along aide Gratitude. It must be presumed -sne -waswaB not ready if wanted for that event, ?and it ia more than likely over the shorter distance in the Guineas, and with S lbs. leas on her back, she will tell a different taleV The extra time also will serve her, so that if aba be- only well on the day, aad basked by her? 'Stable the must be very dangerous. Tremando It . the pnly representative tbe Hon. J. White Will have in the race. He is said to be a little, bit on the leg, but good over a distance. He ran third at Bandwick in the Trial Stakes when a two-year-old, and as a throe- year-old he won the Maiden Plate at Hawkesbury. besting. Cairngorm and others; was second to Bargo in the A.J.C. Derby; won the Maiden Stakes, and ran second to Ternpe in the Second Foal Stakes. It the distance were longer we would like his chances the better, but if he is stripped for the Guineas ha will take a lot pf beating. Sirocco won the A. J.O. .Sapling Stakes and U well apoker. of. Pilot may be ? regarded as a probable non starter. The Bohemian is a good colt, whom time- will serve. Cairngorm should be held safe by Tremando. Weetallabah ran nowhere in tbe January Stakes won by Lord Exeter. It will be seen that on public form Tkemando and Gbatitude are two of the best in tha Guineas, and we shall expect one of these to win, with Helene or Silver King to capsriza them, cr appropriate theplaoes.
