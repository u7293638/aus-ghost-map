Producing several keys from hia pocket, ho soon found ono that turned the lock; Tho window was not bolted inside, and it opened easily, and without the slightest lioiso. They stopped quietly into tha room, and Captain whispored : ' Havo you got the ' glimmor ' all right 9' 'TOS.'.- ?:????'?'??? ''??,.-?' ' ' 'Show a bit of light.'

''VVhow I'; said Tony, in raptures at the haul sthoy were about to mako,' for boforo his astonished eyos was an array of silver plate seldom seen iu this part of tho world. ,, ' StoV that,' Tony. You bag the swngy while I keep, a ''look-out in tho hall.' _--,s }? ; Tony produced a carivasibaffbf consider able dimensions from under his capacious coat, and couimonced to pull a quantity, of soft wadding out of his pockets. Ho had bought this to provont tho plat«.from rattling when safely stowed awayV Ho had seenredtwo or three articles, when Captain Buddonly came bock into the room' and said:,' v ' ?-.: ??[ ' : 'D— -nation. Thorq's somebody stirring. Lie low, Tony. Not a breath.' ;. They hoard the stairs creak as' though someone was coming, down, and then all was still again. Tony had shut, off the light, and thoy were in perfect darkness. ?'?? Captain felt norvous almost for the' first time in his.-lifo'^ An uncanny feeling crept ovor him, nud ho could not help thinking of tho light ho had soon in tho 'haunted room,' as ho styled it. ? Hector Proston occupied tho room abovo, and his wife slept in the adjoining apart ment, thoro being a connection between the two rooms. ,- . , . ? : Preston fancied lie heard a noise in the room below. He was a light , sleeper, arid of a somewhat norvous toinporamon't. Ho could ;,not; rest, and at length got out of bod, and going to his wife's. door said; ? . ' 'Lilian,1 ;aro you asleep?' ,' i i No answer. ;-.' . '. . . .; ?-, ' Lilian,' ho said again. .;':.. '??:'.,'.'?' This timo she answerod, and askod what ho wantod. 'I'm Buro there's someone stirring in tho Iioubo,' lio said; 'I cannot sloop a wink. I- have hoard all Borts of noises.' ' Lilian had gono to bod in an. uneasy frauioof inind. Sho could not got it out of hor lichd that sho hud seen a boat pulling across' tho river, and tho light in thu disused room troublod her. 'You must bo miatakon,' sho said. 'No ono would bo moving about nt this hour. Why do you disturb mo liko this?.', * Hector Preston began to fool foolish.' Ai'tor all, what nebd was thoro to rouse his wife ? Ho went back to bod,- and lay down, but ho could not sloop. Again he hoard a grating sound in tho room below. Ho could stand it no longer, so ho got out of bed again, and oponed tho door quiutly. Ho looked out, and than started. There was a faint glimmor of light'shining out of tho dining-rcoin into the hall. ' , His first impulse was to rouse tho houso hold. Thon ho thought what a fool ho would look if it was only ono of tho inmatos who had gono downstairs during tho night iu soarch of soinothing. Basil Eay's room was close at hand; should lio call him ? Strango to say, Basil won, at thatpro ciso momont, tosBing about, unable to Bleep. His conversation with Lilian Preston had upsot him. Basil was by no means a bad man. He did not consider it wrong to ilirt with Lilian occasionally, but ho folt that aftor hor couvormition on tho lawn, ovon that was now iuiposBiblo without danger to both of the'). Ah Basil lay awako, ho also fancied ho hoard a peculiar noiao in tho house; but ho put it down to ono of tho thousand and one sounds of tho night, which) invariably distract tho rentlcBs uleopor. ' Bats,' thought Basil, and tried to doze off. No use. Ho could not sleep. Just as Hoctor Preston had raado up his mind to go half way down tho lmll stairs, in ordor to ascertain what caused tho light to Bhino from tho dininir-room, Basil Kay got out of bed, struck n light, and sat down in a lounging chair, c(Wr piittiag hi* dwiag-gowB on, . ' I'm suro somebody's stirring, Tony,' uaid Captain. 'Lot us oloar with what you havo got.' ' It is a pity to loavo such a plant,' said Tony. ' Can't bo helped, Tony, Como nlong,' ho said. , Again the' stairs crcakod, nnd, looking out into the hall again, Captain fancied ho liqard someone cautiously creoping do.wn tho stairs. '.....:..' . ..' ..-. ..-....-. — -........'..'. Hoi was not docoived. Hector ProBton wasdbtormined to find out what tho noiBe and light inoant. _ Tony, in lifting his bag) could not avoid rattling somo of the plato in his anxiety to got awayr quickly. , . .: Hoctor Proston hoard it, and in a momont it-flashed upon him that thoro wo'rq' bur glars in tho house, and Sir George's plato was their object. , : .?''', Ho was uriarmod, nnd know not what weapons the burglars might havo in their possession. ,. If ho gavo tho alarm then they would probably got clear away before tha houso hold was aroused. Tho situation in Heron Hall at this par ticular hour was intensely dramatic, could all within its walls have been aware of what was passing. In tho dining-room ,Tony had jnsfc socurod his booty, and placod it carefully on lu'6 shoulder. Captain stood at the door with tho dark Inntern, listening intently for any sound to come from tho hall. . The lanip cast a faint shadow on tho Btaircaso, and Captain saw tho figure of a man leaning over the ban nister. - - . .' Basil Kay sat in alounging chair, in his drossing gown, feeling doprossod and sleop loss;-- ? .- ?'?.-. ? -.. ,'..'' .. ? ? ? Hector Preston was loaning on tho: bannister, half way down tho staircase^ dud lopkirig' ovor in the direction of the room from which the light shone. ' The stillness could almost bo folt, it was so intense. ?-.?????????? ?-???? ? ? ?'. ; Suddenly, and without tho olightost noto of warning, the sharp crack of apiBtol rang through tho silent house. A piorcing Bhriok, and the fall of a heavy body followed.' Tony dropped his ' swag,' and fled for his. lifo through tho open window.and' Captain followed close on his heels. ? They made for tho boat, and jumped in and pulled for tlioir lives across tho river. Basil Kay sprang from his sqat'as though the shot had struck him, and; rushed to.the door, forgetting to take tho light with him. He heard'a' faint rustle at tho further end of .the passage- as ho looked out. ,., ? . , ' . ? » Everything was ? qniot. 'Ho must havo fallen nslqep, and been dreaming. - - - ': No. i That was impossible. He had heard a shot. 'It had roused the inmates, and lights appeared in the various rooms, and doors woro thrown open. Vr ''? Sir Qobrge Qosper was ono of the first to speak. ;- - : - .-.--..????..?-;-.-.',. . '.-'. .'

'Hector-' Hoctor;], Where aro, yon?' soundud from Lilian Preston's room, and in. another inBtiint she was in thq:' pas/age, in a' light wrdpp'uri withlier faco as white as a sheet, and a look of horror in her eyes. 'What lias happened ?'-sho; said. 'Is HectOT.here with' you ?:?-! thought I heard a shot, and it~Vas 'so' near, 'it 'almost sounded iri his room.-; He 'is hot tlierb. Whero is he, fathor ? ' ?'?;? ^ Basil Kay had obtained a- light, and rushed down the staircase. When ho got to tho: foot he fell ; over somotlnhff, and went headlong down on the hall floor, his light going out at tho same timo. ',' Bring a light,' ho shoutod, and in'an instant, half:o-dozqn candles and lainpB wero shinirig'down the staircase. Whatwas this ghastly thing huddled up at the foot of the stairs ?' ? All glanced at it in fearful ainaze. 'Basil was the first to recovor himsqlf. , 'Good God !' ho said, in a voice full of alarm. 'It's Hector Preston. He's been shot' dead.' ' ' In an instant ho was by his sido, and he saw thero was no hopq. ' Hector Proston had : boon shot through tho heart, and.wns stone dead.

She sobbed as though her heart would break. ' Tako hor away,' Sir Goorgo/' whispored Basil. - 'This is no' place for hbr/; Wo must soarch the house and grounds.

Traces ' could bo found in tho damp ground loading down to tho rivor, and it was ovidont tho burglars had rowed across and gono buck tho same way. Tho gonoral opinion was that .Hoctor Prctiton had hoard a noieo in tho dining room, had got up and gono downstairs to soo what caused it, anil surprising the burglars, had boon shot dead on tho spot. Lilian Preston ondorsed this viow, and oxplaincd how Hector had cnllcd hor during tho night, and said ho fancied ho heard a noiso in tho room bolow. She had gono to sloop again, and was next aroused by tho piBtol shot. Tho usual inquest was held, and an open vnrdict of misrdor against some person or porsons unknown was roturnod. ? ? ? Tony and Captain rowed across tho river tho night ol tho burglary as fast as thoy could pull. It was not until thoy were safely on the far sido that Tony said : 'I never got suoh a fright in my lifo. Captain. Who tho duvil could have flrod that shot. You woro looking in tho hall. Did you boo anything ?' Captain did not answer for a few momonta. Then ho said i 'Don't ask mo anything about it tony.

' Novor mind what I saw,' ho said. ' I toll you tho placo is haunted.' ' Didn't I tell you thero was a light in hor room.' ' What room ?' said Tony. ' Lady Qoapor's. Tho one that died in that room.' Tony stared at his companion, and said in nn awo- strncfc voico : ? . ' You don't mean Cap — you, don't mean to aay hor ghost did it.' 'That's just what I do moan, Tony,' he ropliqd.
