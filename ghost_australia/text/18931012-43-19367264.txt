"My dearFenton, I have made up ray mind to leave Pinefalls to-morrow." " Seriously ?" " Yes, seriously," said Vane, gravely. \- Major Weldon will v not hear of ii, dear boy." ' "I am the moro sorry for that, inas much as I mutt go.

Fenton Howe puses at his friond in »<irpriiio, Buii then comes a look of vvundsd prido into his eyes as he "Seat Vane, I am tho last man in the zvAi to pry into your nflkirs, bat I beg of you aa a friend—nny, ai bnb who owes you something moro than mutual esteem, to tell me why you have taken thii sud-. den : resolve.'.: y . ■ : . , j "I cannot tell you, Hotti."

( "Belioro me, Howe, I ratiko no aimtH sacrifice in leaving so many kind friends, but the sacrifice, is offered at tho shrine of duty," says Vane, after a pause. Ex.icily, thinks l-'vtitun. Ho is the m.Mi wanted. »f n surety, anil is puins to, giro hlmsult up to that justico which is clamouring for him. Poor fellow ! Seeing that hi* companion romains filent, Vano cnntiliutw. "With reference Id our joint account f..rwardcdtothoCity Rink at Auckland, 1 had a lettor yester day fniin tho ntan.igrr, who in'onns nio ihat our instructions hnvo been carried out. Thirty thousand |Hiuud» starling has lwon duly placed to our joint ac count." "Indeed, so ninchl" says Fen ton, looking up with a cloml on his fair face, ami his mind evidently not upon their account at tho Hank. " I want to ask you a favor, Howo," adds Vauo, after waiting for his cum pauion to spok. " Certainly, my good fellow.'' " I want your pei mission to divide our money," sayn Temple. "Granted," ro>ponds Fentnn. " I will write » necessary latter to tho mnna ger of the Bank, and you can post it jointly with your own for the same pur pose. Of cuurxc, my wants aru few. I do not require sixteen thousand pnmuli or anything like that aum. Vano. Say you take twenty thousand, and learo 1110 thu odd ten. Ell! come, you won't ro fUBC 1110." V.iiio smiles. " Fifteen thousand pounds is sufficient for inc. Perchance, 1 may not require n shilling of it," ho Kay*, softly. " Pooh ! I trust you m*y liavo tho pleasure of sending ever}' ]>cnny of i:, and I the pleanum of lending you part of mine," responds Howe, e.-irncstly. " I can't unJcriitand il., Vano," ho blurted | out, rising anil striding up anil down tho room. '" If yon would conlido in me ! I Hincereljr trust I have never givon you cause to think of mo othcririso than a gentleman. Toll me, what is the mat ter ? If it's anything short of murder I'll sco you through it, n» certain os your patirnt, manly grticrosity inatclied me from it lingering and painful dvath." Temple Vane opens his eyes to their widen extent at this nuddcu aud unex pected outburst on tho part of tho proud, indolent, aristocratic Fenton. " Sly dear fallow, what aro you talk ing about ?" he asks. " Talking about! why, about your melancholy way, *nd your limping and gutting out of it, and hiding whon other people aro enjoying themselves, and I want you lo do the same," retorts Uoiro, ho)ly. " You put ono under tho inmt lasting obligation, then leave him there without a ghost of n chancn of his ro tumiug tho compliment. Toll mo why you aro tearing in such a hurry V" '" His impossible." " Perhaps you tlnre not J"says Fenton, his face flushing with sudden anger. There is a swift flush in the eye< of tho other, wlio starts as if Howe had struck him, but ho holds a superb command over every muscle uf tho faco aud body. '" I cannot ipi.irrcl with you, sir," ho nays, calmly. *' lam a man no bankrupt iv iho way of friends that I cannot afford to lose tho last remaining one. A month hence, or sooner, you may loam why I dejmrt ; but if the Kiss of your friendship bo the penalty, 1 cannot giro my reasons now." " Enough," retorts Fenton, with a hearty rin^ in his voice. " I suppose we hail I letter say goo.l-uye, and have dono with it. For my p»rt I have looked uiwn yon as—as—nhat the devil does it mat ter ! Look here, you aro leaving me in your debt, and—" " Bo silrnt, Howo," interrupts Temple almost Kternly. F^ntoii looUn, and his flush of anger taues a more ruby lint. "I am unused U> bu ccimin.inded to hold my tongue. I irillsay what I please." " Do so, but 1 m»y remind you that a taunt is out of place, and unworthy of a gentleman," says Vane, quietly. ''Again I ask why sh> uld tre quarrel t we, who have fought misfortune, and hunger and cold together. In saying this I have re gard for you, inasmuch as you will per chance regret this sceue hereafter, as I now regret it." A sullen "oh, very well," and tho two men c'jange the subject. They have much to settle in the way of business, and the dinner bell rings ere it is completed. Temple goes to his room to dress for the evening meal. His parting with Fenton has tried him. and chnfed him to the utmost ; but he lias a more saveru ordeal to encounter in Mndam Elsie and Gmce Weldon. The dinner at Pinefalls is more than usually pleasint, and thereby prolonged on this particular evening. Some of them lave bten spending the afternoon out on the hills, and hare had quite an adven ture with a huge carpet anake, which Harry West did battle with, and came forth conqueror. Whilu the talk is at its loudest Major Weldon beckons Teranga, the Maori, to his side. " W'alford, the agent, will be here to morrow. Have rou got all the books ready for him lo look through when he arrives 1" says he. " Yes, sir, I put 'em in tha office, air— all but one," replies the Maori. " All but one ! What ono J" " Square Oat book—store book I think you cull him," answers Teraiiga. "Ah! stock list, yon mean,"a«ya the Major. " Hunt it up before you gu to btd; mind that!" The Maori \\* obedience, itself. Whi»n the meal is ended, and while the gentle man linger ovor their wine, Tfranga begins his task. Unfortunately' the Mauri cannot read a word of English ; print and manuscript alike are as so much Greek to him. Entering the room occupied by Temple Vane, after an hours search elsewhere, Terauga's gaze falls athwart tho diary tying on a small table near the window, lie pounces on tho fat volume at once, and carries it off in triumph. Music has grown to be the chief plea sure at Pinetalls after dinner; but this happens to be mail night, and thero lias hecn qnito a largo bag of letters deposited at the lodge hut for the " House." The Maori retires to his sanctum early to pcruto his correspondence., . Harry Went is busy in l<is quarters with a pri vato despatch which demands his imme diate attention. .

Mcdam Klhie breaks in upon him, fol lowed by Nila and Uowo, and tho con versation takes a more gmieral turn. It is midnight before Vane retires. Madamo Elsie has said " good bye,'' and tluro wa» an umnistakeahlu tremor in her voice, and a peculiar look in her eyes as she uttered ilia words which carried con viction to the mind of General Ashford s prodigal eon that ho had been recog uisetl. J>y the timo ho had packed away his few things it is three o'clock, and iv another hour it will be daylight, ilia thoughts aro in such n chaotic state that he docs not miss tho diary. Ho has an idea that it is safely stowed away in his travelling bag.

He threw ope» the window. Cool and beautiful the pure early morr. Overhead the light blue canopy was changing to azure, and gold and purple, and blended with gigautic shafts ofa more tnagoitictmt hue, the vanguard of the glorious sun. What mortal hand could place this pic ture before the natural eye? What artist could paint yonder hill-top, carpeted with green and brown, with glittering bars of prismatic light, intermingled with every blade and leaf. . In the fragrant atmosphere of the sum mer morning Temple Viina goes his way to perform that duty of which lie had spoken. And she to whom he had ut tered those wonts stands watching the fast receding figure from her chamber window. Ah lit the poor wanderer could only hare seen the tear beditnmed eyes looking after him with such a yearning sorrow, lio would not have felt tho dense night of utter loneliness and despair now at his heart. . CHAPTER XVIII. AT TUB " OOLUES DOLrHIS." ■ Ou the Grand Trunk Road, distant forty miles or thereabouts from the Pincfalls Station, atauds a roomy old Inn, bearing the somewhat nondoscript name of the "Goldou Dolphin." This hostelry was tiuilt by one Timothy Keegan, a lncfcy diaper, who having made a large find.at.thn Titori Valley, opened the Golden Dolphin; and drank himself to death in a very short time. Tim's widow, Norah Keegan, was five feet elovon inches in her husband's socks, and weighed a trifle over two hnndrod pounds nott. Kongh arid muscular as the majority of the Dolphin's customers certainly were. very few hat] sncli a development of limb as hostess Koegan, nnd very few indeed had such a way of demonstrating the fact to any contumacious firllow who attomptod tocroatoa "shinn" within tho precincts of her domain. Ten years wauderiiiKS " «il poor Tim " over hulf tho j;uldliulds in Now Zealand had not lende<l t<) enhancu Uio penonal charms of Blrs Koen»n. Her complexion bore tho him vi n boiled lob ster, which was " intirel; owing to tho I hate of the auu, of coune, and not in any I way to »ho small drop she tnk to keep ewny tho colic. Bad cess to it." Ficrco. iratn, and heavy hsndeil was Mother Krcgan, yet after her fashion not a mnro kind-hnnrtpd, bcnovolent i>nul erer brcathiKl. She loved fun like all her rare, and hor house w»s always lively. Mick Ruddy, a poor devil who earned a precarious living playing the fiddle from place to pUca round the district, was al ways due at tho Dolphin every Friday ovoning. A sort of a shelf, like a brac ket, fixed in the parlor wall, and high up out of reach. This waa Mick's or chestra where he tuned his baritone, and rasped away at reels and jigs until the small hours of the morning. It is on record (hat the ncor.fiddler fell in love with the " widdy," : and in n moment of sympathetic .tenderness [iluckod upenurago u> confess tho miiio. Tim Kuegan'a relict listened.to her lover until ln> had finished, and then she 'pavn the unfortunate awain suoh a practical refusal that thu doctor had'to bo called in, nnd Ruddy's life was despaired of for some timo. ... Jf Mrs Kecg.lll wns severe b»timvsflii her adorer, she took very pond cue that 110 0110 clso bullied him. Now Zealand can certainly boast of some, thorough going muscular ruffians, but - tho chief of them nil was on« 'Tig|»er, 'Uthcrwiso Blnck Bullock, a rough and tumble pugi list, whote sole occupation was made up in lounging about slianties, night pilftr iug and prize fighting. Bill Bullock— 1 beg his pardon—lilsck Bullock was at the Golden Dolphin on one occasion, nnd began to bully every one as usual. His spleen seemed particularly, directed to wards the little tiddler, whom hu caught in his powerful grip and carried round the room at arms length, as if Ruddy had been no more than a noodle dog. ' The noise attracted the hostou, who ran into, tho room. , " Arrah, what* the matter wid.yes?" she asked. Then ob serving hex favourite in the hands of the burly giant her Irish dander riz in a moment. " Put down the man," sho cried, and at the ramo instant Black Bul lock received a blow full on his frontis piece, which sent him stagcering over two or three chain. Tho pugilist dropped the tiddler, and turned upon his assailant' with a face in which all the latent passion of bruto ferocity was viaibliv Ho camo towards her with fiats clcnchod, his guard well up, and showing his teeth likoa wolf. ; ■.■<■■•. Mrs Kccgan knew her ctutumer, knew that a knock from his huge, long knuckles would bo as a blow from a blacksmith's «lcd(-a. Cut shu did not flinch. Just as the bully had got within range, and be foro he could lungo out at her, she seized a heavy poker from the fender and struck Tiggser a dreadful thud upon his upraised arum, which made the fellow bellow like a mad bull. "Take iluit, yo devil's bastard, an' mend yer maniieis," she cried. "Come on now, if it** G^htjng yer after." ' With a horrid imprecation tho in furiated Bavago steadied himself, and then rushed blindly at the " widdjr." .Up went tho unmerciful poker liko v flash, and the 'Bullock' wont down all in a heap. lie whs carried out and Boused with a plentiful supply of cold water. Uoyonil a broken head and a fractured wrist the bully sustained no further injury, but ho gave tho hostess of the Inn a wido birth from that time forth. On this 'summer evening tba hostrlry was well patronised with a mixed posso of customers, each and all of whom ap peared tit bo eujoying themselves after their own fashion. The long room >v tilled with digger.), nnd there wore uthera present who did not dig or beg. Slick Kuildj- wits in liis ploco " discoursing ili «ant music" after hi* manner, while his auditory dnuced or went through a wild fandango that ahouk the building to its foundation. " Steady, mm ; don't make such a row; sburo Jlr Jocelrn's upstair*, ami can't hear bis can) fur yez," said Mrs Keeean, thrusting her head in at the door. " Mark me now ? 111 not liavu the place turned into a shibbcen whin yer bolters aru prenent." " WVro. a* quod as Mr Jocelvn any day, although ho is a beak and a big bug," cried Black liullock and one or twoothots of the same cliijuu. The hostess put her arms akimbo, and strtxie up to the speaker. " Ix>ok here, mo Itould fellow, this is my house, nn' 1 mane to be cock o' the walk," she said. •' If a gitntluiimn conies hero 1 expect him to behave himself, an' if he doesn't clitue to do that, faith, I'll lam him in double quick time. Do ye nioind now?" " liravo 1 Mother Keegan," from a dozen brawny throata. Bullock, half tipsy, looked round him with a smothered curse on his lips, and a red flash of d'fiauco in his evil eyes; but a whisper from his companion altered the ruffians niolo demeanour in a miu ute to quiet submission. " If it wasn't fur the company beyaut, shun the diril a one cared if y.*» broke the Sure," cried the hostess. "Whin gintlemin, rale gintlemin condescend to honor the Golden Dolphin wid their priz zence I'll have ordther. I've others hero to-night betides Mr Jocelvn. Put that in your pipo and shmuke it, Mr Tiggser," and Mrs Keegan bounced out of the room. Tliß best apartment in the Inu hail been given up to Mr Jocoljn, who was ou hia way to inspects mine at the Titori Valley, bo hu said. Dinner had been ordered for three, for the magistrate rx poctcd two friends to join him at tlio hostelry. lialf an hour later, and tlio expected goesta carao in the personsof l'«ul LSarjew and Sydney Black. Mn Keegan kut»v nothing of Mr Joce lyn, save by report, but ihe had a thorough knowledge of the two men who -were diuiui; with him. However, as she after wards remarked, "it waino butiuesa of hers. People in her position never gained anything by meddling with what did not consarn them," etc. . Wise philosophy,. Mrs Keegnu! The pity ii that more of your charming sex do not follow your example in thu ro spoct. The observance thereof ii often honored in the breach in our day, savo in one or two Australian cities where I hare sojourned. There the people, male and female, fulfil the law of Mn«ra, mid love their neighbours as themselves, ami there, indeed {be wise condition is fully recognised, which says that " theoxsh.ill not bo >okttd with the aw." On this summer afternoon, proriuus to the arrival of ISarjew and his companion, Tcinplo Vano lismouuts under the broad porlicu of the Inn, and orders a inoai and a bod for the ni^ht. His handsome face pleases the " widdy,"' who bestirs herself to make him comfortable. Ho is located next his honor, the J.P., and Vnne oats his dinner alone, bat onj»yH it Mono the lesa for that.
