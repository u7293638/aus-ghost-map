A MUSICAL GHOST. Te Aro, New Zealand, has been visited lately by a musical ghost (says the Welling ton Post). The residents in a certain house, which need not be specified, gradually became aware that at irregular intervals, but especi ally during the night, strains of unearthly music, soft and ghostly in character, proceeded from the family pianoforte. At first it was taken for granted that of course it must be the work of that evil genius in all servant keeping establishments â€” the cat. By degrees, however, it was impossible to sssociate those weird strains with the prancing of puss upon the keys, and it was still more difficult to understand how that domestic animal could open the instrument, execute an unearthly fantasia, close the lid, and vanish directly any one entered the room, as must have been the case, for immediately the door opened the music ceased, and the piano invariably was found shut. At last Mr. Paterfamilias re solved to solve the mystery, and remained on guard, keeping strict silence, and closely watching the open key-board. At last the usual ' fairy-like music' was wafted from the instrument, although no mortal or feline per former touched the keys. Horror seized him, and he fled. Clearly the piano was a medium used by some unquiet spirit haunting the premises, and the family resolved at once to quit the unhallowed spot. Daylight, how ever, inspired them with boldness to look inside the piano, where some very lively young mice were found exercising their limbs on the wires.
