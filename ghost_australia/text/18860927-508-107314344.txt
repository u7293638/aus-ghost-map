Chapter XLI.— Amber is Not to Know. Of course neither Dency, Amber, nor Asa Knew that St. Cyr was alive. Dency, owing to her frozen feet, had been unable to go out of ihe house, and Amber had carefully nursed her day and night. Mother Land's prompt treatment of Asa's case enabled him to attend to his lights, though walking was a painful operation, and to go to Duck Island twice a week and procure, for Dency and Amber whatever they needed, out of the house. He made careful inquiries and kept a close watch along the Bhore for some weeks, hoping to hear something from St. Cyr ; Jbut nothing was to be heard, or seen, and at last they decided that he must have drowned that, night, and his body been carried out to sea ia some of the atorms that followed. To Asa and Dency, much as they regretted this, it was a relief— -for both had foreseen, beyond, his escape, the ? possibility and probability of recapture, and the final fulfilment of his sentence. Better die so than on the gallows. Amber was more silent than ever, . never telling what she thought. She occupied herself as much as possible in nursing Dency and at tending household affairs, and Dency noticed this change in her, that as formerly she used to sit down by the fir© looking away into the darkness, she now stood at the window looking out at the sea. She watched it hours and hours, without speaking.* What she saw, or expected to see, she never told, but Dency overheard her eaying once : . ' He said he would surely come — he said he would surely come to see me again,' and watering her afterwards, saw many times a day her lips forming these same words, over and over, but she never spoke them aloud again. Then, $00, there came a change in the girl's jface — the tortured, intense, strained look was passing away, and a sorrowful, patient watehing and waiting that was very touching to see, had come in its place. Dency said: ;'...* ' I hope the body will never be found. It will be better for her to. have something io look - and live for. The worst is uver now, thank God' This strange creature, .pency, had^become more ,; than ever attached to the girl- since her care and kindness to h&r; in. those long days and nights when she could, not help 'herself or go out ©f doors at all, and she was very unwilling that any more pain or trouble should COine near the child again as long as she lived. So it came to pass, when one day Asa came in. with a horror-struck face, and finding Dency alone, told her the strange news he had just heard over at Clinton, how St. Cyr had been hidden all this time in the old W;-eleh house and had the day before been discovered andjearried back to Haddam gaol, that then Dency raised herself up and said: * That girl must not know of this. She is petting quieted down now — this would stir Her all up again, and she would be worse than she tad ever been. Shefc -suffered enough already; she wouldn't get another moment'^ peace for years, if ever again. We must manage to- keep it away from her somehow, if we have to lie like the dragon. They talked the matter over some lame, devising? various jneans io keep Hie truth from Amber. When they heard herx»ming Dency -said: -* * There now, you keep your eyes off the girl, And xdon't lookas if you pitied her SO awfully, She'll pep right tnrough you if you do. ./ Ton'd better go iioBie*igliti-ff^id not come again very«oon. ^btfre^o f olt- tfiarted^7ou*ja letj.t ali«ui;Jb»fore jotticopw what jrOu are about- „ ftt t-e iwoitfiS ia a few days bow, and I'll eee to thfegs Jbere and manage her too/ * Amfcefc wondered that AsasaH so little to her^wad thfet he stJiyed MV&y;^:fot&,-'b&-i she ttm&e; no words about vtlis inSMrer^and did «wt for & moment «^p©fet-^^i^f - 1 ' ?? penalty of «i^^^|^;j^;^^:^'}Jb^ coinmittedi; ^m^^^ix^iM ?%ias$^.-fy '0*e ' murdered mti& J|ip^pi^^lai ''f^ia^}^D:iM. who shbuld-^j3iel|^|Np|i^ majesty 'of :^^^,m^^^'^0^m^^ . j^e. the most, sldlfe! phj^cj^ and fche best 4are possible i iailpeo: ^Iiibu Parte of both feet were jaanpatated,J and after this he began Blo^wiyJto 'improve. ?'.''?.

His mind was now clear, and he seemed quite resigned to his fate, and to be very thaukful for the care and kindness of' those about him. He seemed greatly changed— the wild look had gone from hip eJeS, and he : was quiet, gentle, and patient. There was a childlike = meekness and humility about him that would have been very touch ing in anyone else. A$d sosnetimes the gaoler's wife, watqhing iiim in his sleep, seeing the pallid, peaceful brow with the dark curls clustering closely about it, and the slaarp lines around the inouth softening to a smile, thought lie must be looking as he iised to whejj a child lying asleep, in his mother's ai'ms, and pitiful tears would fill her eyes -till she could no longer see at aii. ? . ; .'.?...;. '????? ?...????? ? About this time a clerical-lqoking man, wearing: green glasses, called at the gaol and desired to see this same Sfc. Cyr. All visitors 'whatever had beeE denied entrance, but this* man being a minister., was allowed to come in, St. Cyr was asleep .at the time. The stranger stood looking at him for a moment, and his face suddenly paled, and his muscles worked convulsively. He turned as if he could riot endure the sight and strode up and down the room. * Are you a relation of his ?' asked some one in the room. , a ' jl^o,' he answered. ^m . sl]t A^friend, perhaps V .'zi :? .: .-tTothis he-ioadetJaHJ Setely^ but continued his walk until St. Gyr kvfblke. 'Ib was apparently with a~ painful effort that he f orced. himself _tp sit down, with his face a little out of the range of St. Cyr's efes, and ?f.O.11?- TTTl^.l^ llTTYl The watchers who stood by could not hear all that was said, but as near as they could judge the minister was exhorting him to re pentance and offering him spiritual consola tion. St. Cyr acknowledged that he was a miserable sinner— that he deserved all that he had suffered andshould'suffer, but denied that he was indeed guilty of the crime kid to his charge. He confessed that he had bitterly hated his enemies § that more than once there had been black murder in his heart, but he had never committed the crime with his hands, or been a party to it in any way. He supposed, he said, that murder in the heart was the same to God as murder in the hands, and therefore he deserved to suffer all that had been and was to be ; God was kind and pitiful— He would surely for the Christ's sake- forgive him at the last. There was a calm grandeur, a still greats ness about this condemned pran now that awed them who Btood looking on. ' Is there anything you want — have you any earthly desire unfulfilled ?' asked the minister at 'last.' A patient sigh came from St. Cyr's lips as he answered: * ?* I should be very glad to see ray daughter once more — she would be one great comfort to us both.' ' You shall see her,' answered the stranger, and immediately took his leave. St. Cvr lav and nondered. 3Te liad seen this man somewhere before. He had a con fused thought of the benevolent man who tried to make him confess in this same gaol the night after his trial, and, strangely enough., something about him reminded him of Job Fox, too ; the three seemed oddly tangled together. Evidently St. Cyr's head was not quite clear yet Chapter XLIII.— Daniel Hammer does his B&smEss;* Dency was soon, able to go about the house, though she walked lame and made, as she said, a great fuss about stirring. She was very watchful of Amber, and endea vored to keep her constantly in sight. One day she climbed up into the loft for the first time since her lameness. She found many things that needed attention tip there, and 'stayed longer than she intended, but as she had left Amber busy in the kitchen, she apprehended no trouble for her, ..?-???' . At that same time a man . had taken a boat atHononhatesue Point, and was rowing across to Duck Island. He evidently under-: stood managing: a boat as well as St. Cyr or Dency herself; he aad strong, vigorous arms, too, it would seem, for when he -was a little distance from the shore he bent over his oars, and sent thfe little craft darting over the waves like a. seagnlL He went straight to the wharf, as if he had been there before. Here he left the boat and went to the house. * !Nbw, if that creature Isn't here, I shall get along well enough/ iw *&& to himself as ne approacnea cue attar. A glance through the window revealed Amber alone, and the inm^loojang xoliered, gently tapped at the door. Amber straightway opened ibe door, and saw standing there a partly looking man in. a suit of black, with & huge white neck doth enveloping Ha taBgk $nd the lower part of his chin.

Daniel Hammer had a horse and waggon waiting for him by the roadside, up across from Bushy Point. Dency got a horse from an old -farmer she knew on the Glinton road, and followed on, keeping in sight of the waggon jogging on ahead. . 1 Neither Amber nor her escort had much to say to each other. He seemed very thoughtful, casting frequent glances over his shoulder at the solitary horseman in the distance. As for Amber^ste sat very quiet, holding in her hands her mother's Bible. Between its leaves was a tress . of light brown hair that was cut from her mother's head, and beside it a tiny curl of the palest gold, from the head of that baby brother who was buried in. its mother's arms. This Bible she was carrying to her father, and she had no thought for any one but him now. (TO TJE CONTIHUED.)
