LONDON POLICE. The Question of Expenses, When a policeman is called on to pawn his watch in the interests of the public service he lias every title to be considered a martyr to duty. An inci dent which occurred at W03t Ham (says London "Daily Telegraph") -shows that sucn a proceeding is not aitogetner un known in the force. A constable had to take a. prisoner to Holloway, and It it appears that he must pay the fares out of his own pocket, the sum spent being reimbursed him at the end of the week. The police are paid 011 Wednes days, and a man with 25s a week can not he expected to have much petty cash in his pocket by the following Tuesday. Consequently the constable had 110 money to pay the fares to gaol, and tried to borrow some from his col leagues, who, unfortunately, were in the same position as himself, waiting for the ghost to walk Into an empty pocket. i-Iow he managed to convey his charge to Holloway is unknown, but It is supposed among his comrades that he did what they sometimes have to do in similar circumstances â€” pawned his watch, which was . redeemed on 011 the Wednesday, when liis weekly allowance is 'handed to him. Occasionally, when the distance traversed is a long one and the sum comes to nine or ton shillings, so many red-tape formalities . are required that the constable Is deprived of his money for a month or six weeks. True, the Commissioner supplies officers with cre dentials, but these only allow them to travel at a reduction of fare. It Is very hard on a policeman that -he should be called upon to pawn his watch in the public service, when the small admini strative change might relieve him from sueli a predicament.
