"Mitchell's Majority," ( Vide Cartoon .) To grass grown graves where ghosts assemble, Where ghouls and goblins gloat ; Brave Chalmers goes without a tremble, To fetch folks upito vote. By threat and curse, by prayer and pleading, He gets his fiendish griff, j And to the booth, triumphant leading, i He comes with voters stiff. i The self -same steed, now somewhat jaded, I As Orange Billy mounted â€” | When in the Boyne he fearless waded j Has Chalmer's votes discounted. j Fori thirty pounds he dares the devil, j For Mitchell and for Sparkes ; For thirty pounds he does his level, To save poor Premier Parkes. And as he went his gloomy rounds, On L. 0. L. authority, He thought the price of thirty pounds Fair, fbr JoeiM's majority. a
