Hey, Diddle, Diddle. Hey, diddle, diddle I The cat and the fiddle, Are getting old-fashioned, I trow, More novel 'twould be for a great wallaby The organ to play with one toe. For the moon to give chase to the man on her face, And the comet to join inthe fun. For the evergreen rabbit to weep at the habit Of squatters infesteog its run. For the novelist p ale to yield op his tale To the .hasp aS I3oJ.p4Sp w0oal ve.. For the ghost of the mosa. to st on Jack Horner White Coroner Catb seek a hearse. For emall dgs to giggle when cows give a wriggle, That land them away peast the moon, Is really quite etale, ae is also the tale Of the dish makingoff with that spoon. Now, not to make off with a spoon when there's moon, lea far more astonishing thing. And to see the moon wriggle-oh, hey diddle, diddle, In that case you really might sing. -E.T.
