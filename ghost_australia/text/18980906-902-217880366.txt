rough on the ghost. In Victoria they have a sternly practical method of treatieg ghosts, which, in these; days of mock sentimentality, I admire. Let the reporter speak for himself:â€” "At Bendigo on a recent Sunday, shortly after 8 o'clock, some youths, armed with a double- barrelled gun, stationed themselves at the corner of Bayne and Stewart streets, and had not been, wailing long, when piercing screams were heard from the corner of the next street. The young men ran to the spot, and found a girl frantic and trembling with fright. She could only utter, ' The ghost ! the ghost !' and swooned away. Turning the corner the lads saw a figure in white moving slowly along the footpath, under the shade of the street trees. One of them fired at it, and without a sound, the figure jumped a neighboring fence, and made off into the garden. The ghostly mantle was dropped in rhe flight, and when picked up was found to consist of half dozeu yards of white muslin. As it bore shot marks it is more than probable that the 'ghost' was struck by some of the pellets, though he gave no sign." If all ghosts were served in this summery manner they would, I think, find it more to their own personal comfort to find some other occupa tion than frightening the wits out of timid young ladies and small boys.
