One absurd provision as to permits is that in-corporate townB the permits must be signed by two Justices, one of whom must be the Mayor, Stipendiary . Magistrate, or a Superintendent or Inspector of Police,, as well as;, by ai second Justice. Veiy'few Mayors who -are not already Jus tices care to qualify for the position if the_ honor is to oease with their tenure of the Mayoral office — our present Mayor has not done .so; and .it frequently happens that the Stipendiary "Magistrate is away from bome for a week at a time in the discharge pf jiis . official duties If then there jis -no .Mayor _who is a Justice, no Stipendiary Magistrate, and no Superintendent or Inspector of Police, how is the permit to l}e obtained ?
