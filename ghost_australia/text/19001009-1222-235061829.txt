Jack The Ripper Dead. JACK THE RIPPER is dead. He died (says Figaro) in a private lunatic asylum in England, unknown to the majority of the public, but his identity was fully estab- lished some time before his death. He was a medical student of good family and con- siderable means, and there is no reason to suppose that when his family first put him under forcible restraint, they had any idea that he was the author of the Whitechapel horrors. Two prominent journalists, G. R. Sims and T. P. O'Connor, M.P., are among the few who know the facts of the case. The whole matter has been kept very dark as it was felt that no good would be done by re-opening the case. The police authorities, however, were aware of the circumstances, and undoubtedly felt re- lieved, when this human fiend gave up the ghost.
