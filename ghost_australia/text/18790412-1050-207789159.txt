To each of them in turn she spoke of Jesus, and knelt with them in earnest prayer to God for His gracious interference in their -behalf, and she had tbc happiness of seeing that :they felt increasingly interested in tho message of redeeming love. To her dear father she spoke - as to a dying man, and ho who had been com missioned by liis' fellow-men to minister in holy things found that he needed one to teach him which were the first principles of the oracles of God. How touching to see his own child leading him, as it were, by the hand to the Saviour, the" young girl telling to the aged minister wonderful tliiugs, of which he had never heard till now 3 With her mother she had long conversations ou tho sad attempts made by - Romanists and Ritualists to lend to Christianity by human device an attractiveness which . it was never intended to have in carnal oyes, and which the Saviour and His apostles in their studied simplicity evidently repudiated. She. showed her that while the meek and lowly Jesus was despised and rejected of men because of His meekness and lowliness, to tho enlight ened eye of -the true believer 'He is and shall ever "be the : " altogether lovely." The. deeply humbled mother listencd-.to the child still left to her with; feelings very different to those by which she was influenced in the , days of Mr. '.Bayley's power.

Florence .had herself taken the matter, in-;, hand, and he', was; relieved from the terrible - task of proposing that .they must part for. ever. He re plied by a few lines that .he would wait on her the following day. : ' , ;'S How novel- were the feelings with which , .he rung the .parsonage door- bell, the next day ! Many and many a time had-Re rung, the,, same bell,, and never with ; the least doubt - as to ;his reception., : There- was one within he . know by whom he was expected, . and to whom he would be welcome. - The old butler,- James Kennedy, always received him with a smile and a manner which ; he reserved for those who stood in olose and intimate relation to the family. You could almost tell .the. measure of intimacy on which any visitor ' stood from , old Kennedy's reception of them at the 1 hall door. There could be no mistake about Mr. Bayley. Kennedy's smile and obeisance, some thing between a nod and a bow, said as plainly as could he : "I hid you welcome, sir, in the name of my young mistress, who, I know, loves yon." On the present occasion, however, the flag floated only half-mast high. There was no smile, and the bow was formal and mysterious. It spoke a new language, but not one difficult . to interpret — it was the language of sadness and separation. The curate passed in and was shown into the drawing-room, the scene of many a pleasant tele-d-tete with- mother and daughter, the almost constant evening resort for tea and relaxation. In a few minutes the door again opened, and Florence entered, pale, calm, stately, yet per fectly natural. Florence Rumford indeed, but not Cornelius Bayley's Florence. It seemed as if years had intervened between their last inter view and the present, and that she looked back upon all that had passed as a childish drGam — a thing of "long, long ago." " Cornelius," she said in the coolest manner, "sit down j" and herself sat down near him on an ottoman. " I hope I have not put you to any inconvenience in asking you to come here to- day, but the fact is I wish to tell you myself, what I was sure you would hear from others, that I have joined the Roman Communion." "I have heard it, Florence," Mr. Bayley replied with ill-affected calmness, "and I- con fess I felt surprised that you had given me1 no notice of your intention." : " ' "What was the use of it,- Corriefiusi? ; Tlie step was inevitable,' and therefore renionstrauce was useless. : ! felt sure -that 1' :should;rsparb ; myself,' and you mot less, I aideal; of unnecessary pain by doing at once what-I-felt nojpowbr on oartli would prevent-me doing - ultimately; .'and 'what, now that it is done, tlie wealth: of : a - thousand; worlds woiildnot induco'mq tb undo.'' \- - " Have' you any olij ection;- 'Florence,' ' to state the'reasons1 by which' you' were induced' to ' take this- stqp"?-'-.
