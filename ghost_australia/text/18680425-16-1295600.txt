A. O SO ST START. IN "A Strange Christmas Game," By Mrs. J. H. Riddell, in the 3roadii)aj/'t\ro find the following - It was the middle of November when we arrived at May Langdale, and found the place any thing but romantic 01 pleasant The walks were wet and sodden, the trees were leafless, there were no flowers. save for late pink roses bloom ing in the garden It had been a wet season, and the pi ice looked miserable Claro would not ask Alice down to keep her company in the winter months, as she had intended and for myself, the Cronsons were still absent in New Norfolk, where they intend to spend Christmas, with old Mrs Crouson, now recovered Alto gether, Mmtuigdiilo scorned dreary enough, and the ghost stories we had laughed at while sunshine flooded the rooms, became lost unreal when no had nothing but blazing fire and wax candles to dispel the gloom They became more real also when seri not lifted servant left us to seek silver lions elsewhere' when "noises" grow frequent in the house , when we ourselves, Ciato und I, with our own cats heard the trump, turnip, the hanging and the chattering which had been do I seemed to us My dear render, you doubtless are ft co from Biipoistitious finishes You pooh pooh the existence of ghosts, and only wish you could find a haunted house in which to spend a night, which is all very b are and pc rise on thy, but wait till you are left in a di cary, desolate old country mansion, filled with the most the accountable sounds, without a servant, with none save an old care taken and his wife, who, living at the extremest end of the building, heard nothing of the tramp tramp bang, bang, going on at all hours of the night. At first I imagined the noises were produced by some evil disposed persons, who wished for purposes of their own, to keep the house uninhabited, but by degrees Chu of and I came to the conclusion the visitation must be superintend!, and Huntingdale by consequence uiitoniiiitnblti Still being practical people, unlike our predecessors, not liming money to live where and how no liked, no decided to watch and see whether we could trace any human influence in the matter If not, it was agreed to were to pull down the right wing of the house and the principal stars Luise for nights and nights no ml up till two or three o'clock in the morning, Dliiro engaged in needlework, 1 residing with ii mother lying on the table beside me ; but nothing, neither sound nor appearance ion in bed airtight 'tins confirmed my best ideas that he Bounds 2010 not supernatural , but just to out the mutton determined on Christmas eve, the anniversary of Mr Jeremy Lester's its appearance, To keep watch myself in the red bed wounded his car to CHILLI never mentioned my intention About 10, (needed with our previous girls who each retired to rest Somonhnt stoiitiitioiisly, perhaps, I noisily shot the (four , ~ o j o i at my (foot of my room, and then I opened it half an hour after trails, no house could hay c pursued westerly along the corridor with greater silence and caution them myself Quito in the clink I sat in the red room for over an hour I might as well have been in my grave for any thing I could see in the near front, but at the end of that time the moon rose and cast strange lights across the floor and upon the will of the haunted chamber Hitherto I kept my watch opposite the window, now changed my platoon corner near the door, where I hub shaded from observation, by the heavy hangings, of the bed, and an antique wardrobe Still 1 But on, but still no sound broke fhosileiico I « us wear y with many nights'»niching and tired of my school at night, I chopped at last into a slumber from which I was awful ened by healing the door softly opened " John " send my sister, almost in a channel , John, are you here?'

His attention seemed con continued on the cards for a time there was utter silence in the room, broken only by the momentous counting of the game in the doorway we stood, holding our breath, terrified and yet fascinated by the BcoHO which was being acted before us 'He saw. the Alio ashes dropped on the hearth softly and like the snow, we could hear the rustle of the cards as they were dealt out and

" 'There was 11 bustle and confusion singing over of chairs, and floral gesticulation, and such a noise of passion unto voices mingling, that we could not hear a sentence which was littered All at once, how over Jeremy Lostcrstiodo out of the room in so great a hurry that he almost touched us where we stood , out of the room, and tramp, tramp up the staircase to the bed room, whence he descended in a few minutes with a couple of rumors under his arm When he re entered the room he gave, as it seemed to us, the other man his choice of the weapons, and then he flung open the window, and after ceremoniously giving place for his opponent to pass out first, he walked forth into the night air, Clare and following We went through the garden and down a narrow winding walk to a smooth piece of turf, sheltered from the north bytiplonlution of young fir trees It was a bright moonlight night by this time, and we could distinctly see Jeremy Lester measuring off the ground "When you say 'three,'" he said at last to the man whose back was still towards us They had drawn lots for the ground, and the lot had fallen against Mr Lester He stood thus with the moonbeams falling upon him, and a handsome fellow I would never desire to behold "One began the other, " two, and before our kinsman had the slightest suspicion of his design, he was upon him, and his rapids through Jeremy Lester's breast At the sight of Unit cowardly treachery, Claro screamed aloud In a moment the combatants had disappeared, the moon was obscured behind a cloud, and we were standing in the shadow of the fir plantation, shivering with cold and terror But he knew at last what had become of the late owner of Martindale, that he had fallen, not in fair fight, but foully murdered by a false friend When late on Christmas morning I awoke, it was to see a white world, to behold the ground, and trees, and shrubs all laden and covered with buoy There was snow everywhere, Such snow as no person could remember having fallen for forty one years " It was on just such a Christmas as this that Mr Jeremy disappeared," remarked the old sexton to my sister who had insisted on dragging me through the snow to church, whereupon Claro fainted away and was carried into the vestry, where I made a full confession to the Vicar of all we had beheld the previous night At first that worthy individual rather inclined to treat the matter lightly, but when a fortnight after the snow melts away and the fir plantation came to be examined, he confessed there might be more things in heaven and earth than his limited philosophy had dreamed of in a little clear space just within the plantation, Jeremy Lester's body was found We knew it by the ring and the diamond buckles, and the sparkling breast pin, and Mr Crowson, who in his capacity as magistrate came over to inspect these relics, from visibly perturbed at my narra- tive "Pray, Mr Lester, didyouin your dream see the face of-of the gentleman-your kins- man's opponent'" "No," I answered, "he sat and stood with his back to us all the time" there is nothing more, of course, to be done in the matter," observed Mr Crowson " No- thing," I replied, and there the affair would doubtless have terminated, but that a few days afterwards, when you were (dining at Cronson Park, Club all of a sudden dropped the glass of ytatorsho was carrying to her

confessed everything to me You don't bring further sorrow and disgrace upon us by making this imitator public?"
