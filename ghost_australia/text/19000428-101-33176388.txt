THE SHOOTING FATALITY IN MONGER-STREET. AN"INQUEST OPENED. The inquiries made hy the police into the circumstances surrounding the death of Joseph Jackson point to the fatal wound having been inflicted by misadven- ture. Jackson and his room mate, young Park, had been discussing ghosts, when the former took from a box an unloaded revolver, and placed a service Lee- Metford cartridge in one of the chambers. The length of this cartridge prevented the revolution of the chambers so it was re- moved and a cartridge adapted to the revolver inserted. Jackson snapped the revolver, saying, "Let 'em (the ghosts) all come." Despite the request of the father of Park, who was in the next room, and who, hearing the noise, called to the young men to desist, deceased, apparently, repeated the experiment once too often, for the cartridge exploded and the bullet entering his left temple passed to the op- posite side of the skull which it bulged out. The bullet has apparently followed an upward course. Deceased was left- handed and that accounted for the wound of entry being in the left temple. During on Tuesday a post mortem examination was made by Dr. Blackburne, resident medical officer at the Perth Hospital.
