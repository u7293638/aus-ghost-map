All Round AND A SEQUEL. As a venerable minister tells this story it would be ungracious and superfluous to adduce farther evi dence of its truthfulness. 1 1 went to a new parish that year,* bâ‚¬ relates. ' In looking about for a house I came upon a very handsome residence that was charmingly situ ated. But everything indicated that the place had long been without a tenant, and I made inquiry. The house was haunted acoording to neighbourhood tradition, and no one would rent it. I saw the landlord, and he was glad to let the place on easy terms. It would be worth much to him if I would exorcise the ghost placed there by popular superstition. ' We moved in .and I admit that we had a very creepy experience one that my wife oould not long have endured. ?.. When everything had settled , down to the quiet of the night we would ' frequent ly hear the most distressing moans and the sound of someone walking heavily in the attic I made several visits to that gloomy part of the house-btit oould find nothing to ac count for the uncanny noise. ' The next night that we were dis turbed I went up there with the de termination to fathom the mystery. And I did it. The moans were pro duoed by the soughing of the wind through the district telegraph wires that were numerous on one side of the roof. The ' heavy walking ' was accounted for by a loose slate, flapped by the same wind that did the moan ing. Next morning I had the wires removed and the roof repaired.' 'And that was all?' -^ot quite. The landlord at onee advanced my rent one hundred per cent.'
