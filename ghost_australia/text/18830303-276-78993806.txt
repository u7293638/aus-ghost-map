SUPERNATURAL STORIES. By J, GRASSIE, Events at variance with physical analogy, which supersede the subordination of facts to laws and the self-evolving powers of nature, involve an appreciation of that physical truth which is attained by an ac- quaintance with science; but it cannot be denied that amidst a wide spreading scepti- cism In supernatural agencies some extraordi- nary manifestations have occurred, which we cannot now, and perhaps never shall, bo able to explain, although probably, if we know how to explain them, their solution would be very slmple. I will at present confine myself to three cases which came partly under my own observation, and leave the reader to draw conclusions from undisputable facts. In 1836 a hawker was murdered in Assyn, in the North of Scotland, and so mysterious was the crime that no thread of suspicion pointed to anyone in the parish until a rather considerable period had elapsed, when a witness appeared and made the incredible assertion that, in a dream, the murdered man had come to him and descrlbed where the pick and mason's hammer with which he was killed were ooncealed, stating also that Hugh MacLeod, the parish or state schoolmaster, was the murderer, and John MacKay, who knew nothing of the crime, owner of the hammer. On going to the place indicated next day he found the pick and hammer, and the mason at once admitted that the hammer had been stolen from his premises. But suspicion, in place of pointing at the school- master, pressed heavily against the dreamer himself ; and he was on the eve of getting into hot water over the matter, when cir- cumstances transpired that did in some slight degree connect MacLeod with the murder, and he was commited for trial. At the trial in Inverness the judge, Moncrief, in summing up the evidence, made a dead set at the dreamer, and went in for an acquittal of the schoolmaster. But the jury, who were extremely superstitious, brought in a verdict of "not proven," and the Sheriff at once re-arrested MacLeod, and the dreamer along with him. Six months elapsed before the then next assizes came round; and in the meantime new evidence had transpired (angainst MacLeod, so strong that the dreamer was liberated, and again appeared as a witness. Again the Judge laid the murder at his door, and the Jury returned another verdict of not proven, The Sheriff again re-arrested MacLeod, and placed the dreamer under the surveil- lance of the police. It was remarked as singular that although there were three celebrated advocates shaking his evidence, it was not disturbed in any material point, Before the third circuit came round conclusive evidence against MacLeod had transpired, and the third verdict was guilty; but the Judge had so far modified his direc- tion as to oonsider the dreamer only an accessory, but the marvel-loving Jury would not entertain the soft impeachment. MacLeod confessed his guilt, and died on the scaffold at Inverness extremely penitent a few days thereafter; and I was close beside him and heard him, two or three minutes before his death, tell the Sheriff emphatically that as he had God to meet the dreamer knew nothing whatever of the murder. This is my opinion of the mystery, I believe the dreamer fell in with the pick and hammer accidentally, or when looking for something else ; and, having overhauled the goods, saw something amongst them similar to the articles in possession of McLeod, whioh directed his suspicions to the schoolmaster. If the ghost had in reality put in an appear- ance, it ought to have given a clue to the evidence by which Mcleod was subsequently convicted, and which transpired independent of it, It ought, at any rate, to have men- tioned that Mary, the maid at the inn, had a silk dress and silk stockings given to her from the murdered man's pack by the school- master. The next case must be ascribed to natural causes as yet perhaps little under- stood, probably to mesmeric influence or some unknown form of nervous affection, A mason named Sutherland, working in Inverness, dreamed that his daughter Katie, as he called her, had fallen over the rocks at Cromarty, where he generally resided, and was killed, and he was so disconsolate, and believed so firmly in the vision that he started for Cromarty at once, and on arriving there had his dream confirmed. This case admitted no question of record or testimony, or exaggerated narrative, for the man's fellow workmen accompanied him to the boat, and before parting, tried to persuade him that his dream was only an idle vision of the night, but it turned out to be correct in every particular, Whithersoever we turn we encounter phenomena which baffles all attempts at ex- planation and puts inductive philosophy at defiance, and as we do not know the extent of nature, we cannot be expected to define where nature's law begins or ends; and future discoveries would probably be as start- ling to us as ours would have been to those who passed away a hundred years ago, Dur- ing the revival mania at Kilayth, in Scot- land, a good many years ago, some of the persons revived used to speak in what was supposed to be miraculous tongues, but a number of people used to attend church at that time drawn thither by mere curiosity, and amongst these a commercial gentleman of the Jewish persuasion, who was also a good linguist, one day attended, On that occasion a poor illiterate half- witted creature known as " Big Lexy " was revived, and uttered the miraculous language in very loud strains; and I heard the " German Jew,"- the commercial gentleman in question, assert seriously, that the woman was actually speaking pure Hebrew all the time. The reader must take this statement, for what it is worth, as I have no evidence but that of the German; but I can vouch that he was a man of veracity and attended church on that occasion as a sceptlc.
