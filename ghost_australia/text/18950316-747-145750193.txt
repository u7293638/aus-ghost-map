COAL, IRON, AND MEN. 'V AN IMPRESSION; Under our present system of private ownership! of 'the earth, where the earth offers the greatest richest look there for the worst human conditions. I; am 'writing1 : from' the heart of the greatest; coal, oil, arid iron region of the United States. ! In . this spot only, of all places in the 'United States, so far as I know them, do you find slums out on the hillsides; . and in the midst of the hills is a city that is like a great horror to the sight.. ? ? ?'.????? 1 ' '? . Crowded between clilf and river, overhangmg the turbid} yellow waters, piled up helter skelter, are toppling, beetling, yawning piles of brick work'* and 'rotten wood, blockcried and askew. Through cracks and open ends you see streams of liquid fire squirming and darting. Out of escape pipes with half -raised lids are flares of light. Above these belches from thousands of chimneys a never-ending, choking yomit of black, smoke arid white steam which darkens all the city at midday with a ghastly yellow atmosphere, through - which the unsightly piles of building grin at you like ghosts of a hideous impossible. Down upori you comes the choking,: clinging shadow, and begrimes you and all about you. Below,:it is slimy and black; above, yellowness and 'shadows— there is neither earth nor sky. ' ? Crashing sounds, blackened, huddled, gigantic shapeleBsness ; fire, smoke, iron— these you see, and you involuntarily look for blood. I cannot explain why, but I have so felt that these things feed on human lives, that from the first moment that I caught sight of the city on my first visit, I stood up iri excitement and whispered, ' It is like a quarter in hell ! ' ' I have looked stupidly to see if there were not an oozing of blood in the gutters. ?' The city goeth on to her cleansing. Will that call for ? blood ?— Alice Thaohee Post, in The New Earth. ,
