RATING A GHOST. ! During the past few days a rumour was pre- j valent in ons part of the city that some ghosts 1 had been seen in the vicinity of the University, j and that they had taken the form of female figures in flowing robes, and disported them- j selves amongst the gloomy battlements after 1 the "shades of evening" had closed o'er the city. Numbers or people, intermixed with a large assortment- of the larrikin element, congregated on sevaral occasions in the vicinity of the seat of learning for the special purpose of having a glance at the spectral visitants, ana cm Thursday they were gratified beyond their most sanguine expectations. Sub- ineoector Rush received information of their desire, rA gent Senior-sergeant MKay and several able-bodied constables to give them sata faction. Thev found a motley crowd assembled, alsii saw a figure marching up the University avenue dressed in a petticoat and covered with a sheet The constables iron-ipd lately gave chase, but this ghost was too nimble for It dropped its cerements, vaulted over the palings, and ran across the shrubbery, where it disappeared among the people, and was seen no more. The sheet and petticoat were captured, however, and bore evidence of having been used by some person or persons with little regard for cleanliness. It is to be regretted that the police were not sufficiently cautious and nimble to catch the delinquent whose want of brains ap pears to have been compensated for fleetness of foot. â€” Echo.
