MELBOURNE CUP. (Br SsoENG OE). (Conuimed). Baronet, 6 yrs, 7at 111b, has never done anything worthy of note, and certainly nothing to entitle him to Vat 111b in the cup. If he has a ghost of a show in the Cup with 7st 1llb, he must have the Metropolitan at his meircy with 1st 111b less, though I do not think he hasa ghost of a show in the Cup. Sweet William, 4yrs, 7at lllb, won the Brunswick Stakes at the V.R.O. Autumn Meeting, 1) miles, 7st 31b, time 2min. 10l sees ; and ran third in the Australian Cup, 2) miles, 6at 131b, won by Pollio, Oat 71b. At the Hawkesbury Racing Club Autumn Meeting, April 1st, ran let ; ran second in the Autumn Handicap, li. miles, Oat 121b, won by the Drummer, Gast Glb. At the A.J.C. Autumn Meeting, William ran second in the Gold Cup, 2 miles, 6st 101b, won by Cunnamulla, Oat, and as he now meets Cunnamulla, and at an advantage of 151b better terms,, he must certainly hold him safe. Sweet William I thin. has been -too leniently treated, and I reckon his chance in the Cup as a very good one. Crystal, Syre, 7st 101b, started several times this year, but was only successful once, winning the Kynoton Handicap, 1o miles, 7st 41b; Pollio, Vst 81b, second. Crystal is really only a second-rate horse, and cannot be said to have a show in the Cup, with e7st lOlb. Sunset, aged, 7st 101b, at Tattersall's Club, August lMeeting, won the Novel Selling Race, 1 mile 7st 31b, time lmin. 44 0-10th sees. At the Parramatta J.O. races, won the Flying Handicap, 7 fur. longs, sat, time lmin. 38sces., and ran third in the Loftus Handicap, 1 mile, 8at 51b, won by Templar, 7st 91b. At the A.J.O. Spring Meeting won the Wolter Handicap, 1 miles, Ost 21b, time 2min. 14 8.10th sees. ; Zulu (cup winner), being second, with Ost 101b. At the V.R.C. Spring Meeting, he won the Essendon Stakes, 2 miles, Oat 71b, time 3min. 30 sees., and won the Darling Stakes, i miles, Ost 61b, time 2min. 50secs. At the Tasmanian J.C. races, he won the Stewards' Cup, Handicap, once round the course, list 121b. At the Tasmanian T.C. races, ran, second in the T.T.C. Handicap, 11 miles, 7st 91b, won by Napper Tandy, Oat 1ib, and ran second in the Free Handicap, Ost 21b, won by Queen, 8st Ilb. ' Sunset has proved that he is fast, and can stay. the distance, and with 7at 101b I take him to be one of the best in. Assyrian, Syrs, 7st 10lbs, is a horse greatly fancied by a few. At the Ade aide C. C. Winter Meeooting, last August, he won the Duke's Handicap, 13 miles, 8st 51b, time 2min. 51secs., and also won the Royal Handicap, 1 mile, Oat lllbs, time 1min. 5leacs. At the A. R. C. Park Meeting he ran second in the Exhibition Handicap, 1 mile, sat 41b, won by Turret field, Oat 8bth. At the S. A. J. C. Spring Meeooting ran second in the Spring Handi cap, 1Â¼ miles, Oat 21b, won by Vagabond, Oat 5lb. The Assyrian seems to be in form at present, having won the Duke's Handicap at the A. R. O. Winter Meeting on Saturday last. Though he has figured very well over ono.mile-and-a.half, I do not like his chance in a two-mile race. Saunterer, aged, 7st 01b, ran third in the Welter Handicap, 1) miles, Oat 21b; won by Sunset, Oat 21b, at the A. J. C. Spring Meeting. At the Sydney T. C. Races ran second in the September Handicap, 1 miles, 7st 61b, won by Guinea, 7st 31b. At the last V. it. C. Spring Meeting he won the Hotham Handicap, 1"h miles and a distance, 0st 51b, time 2min. 62)aec. At the sametn mooting ran second in the Darling Stakes, 1 miles, Oat 51b, won by Sunset, at 51b; ran second in the Veteran Stakes, .11 miles, 7st 51b, won hy Josephine, fOst 51b; and ran second in the V. R. R. . Handicap, 13 miles, 7st 11b, won by Creswick, 7at 7lb. At the Sydnoy T. . Races, in December, he won tihe Club Handicap, 1 mile and 1 fur long, 8st 21b, time 2min. 25jaece. At the Hawkesbury R. 0. Autumn Meeting ran third in the Sportsman's Handicap, 1 mile 3 furlongs, 8st 71b, won by Cunna mulla, 7at 31b. At a difference of only Ilb, I think Sunset holds him perfectly safe, and therefore I must dismiss him. Navigator, 3 yrs, a7st Olb, is one of the most consistent performers we have had as a two-year-old, as the following per formances will show. At -the V.R.O. Spring Meeting, lie ran a dead heat for second place in the Maribyrnong Plate, 5 furlongs, 8at 101b, with Guesa. work, 8st 101b won by Segenhoe, 8st 101b. At.. the same mooting he won the Flyisig Stakes, g mile, 6st ib, time lmin.. 10feecs. At the Ohampion Meeting he won the Normanby Stakes, 5 furlongs, 8st 71b, time umin. OJ sees. At the GOoelong R.C. Annual Meeting, won the Sires Produce Stakes, 7 furlongs, Oat 31b, time 1min. 37sees. At the V.R.C. Autumn Meeting, he won the Ascot Vale Stakes, j mile, Sat 101b, time 1min. 181sees. At the A.J.C. Autumn Meeting he won the Champagne Stakes, O furlongs, 8st 101b, time 1min. 160sece. ; ran third in the Sires Produce Stakes, 7 furlongs, 8st 101b, won by Jessie, 8st 8ib; and ran second in the Great Foal Stakes, 6 furlongs, Oat 31b, won by Jessie Ost lib. Navigator is certainly one of the beatcan didates for the "blue riband," but I think he has got about half a stone too much to carry, to give himn a show in the Cup.
