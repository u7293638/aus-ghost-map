RANDOM PAPERS,. BY J. M. MCnT IN-J-AItiC PLACES. When religion consisted more in dogma than in living, the condition of the poor and degraded around them excited but a languid interest among even the honest and godless professor It was felt that so long as the man retained propT convictions regarding original sin eternal punishment, the pre destination of the reprobate and the elect, and other cheering dogma little else was required of him.
