# Australian Ghost Map
Map of Ghost Stories in Tasmania and Australia, extracted from Trove data

## To Kate Wood
Please work on the file called 'records2_w_placenames'. This is the file that I have extracted the articles with ghost-related words in the title, then extracted the 'placenames' from. Most of the placenames already listed in the last column are incorrect. If you can look through and try to fix (feel free to download the file, fix up in Excel or whatever program you prefer, then reupload under a different name).
